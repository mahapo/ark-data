Vetterli holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from ETH Zurich, a Master of Science degree from Stanford University (1982) and a PhD from EPFL (1986). He taught at Columbia University as an assistant professor and then associate professor. He was subsequently named full professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, before returning to EPFL to head the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (<a href=\"https:\/\/lcav.epfl.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LCAV<\/a>). Professor Vetterli\u2019s work on the theory of wavelets, which are used in signal processing, is considered to be of major importance by his peers. Professor Vetterli knows EPFL inside and out.
