of all there was the so-called via mares or in hebrew derek hayam the way of the sea"},{"startMs":657360,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"i like to think of this as the scenic route where you would go from the left from the nile delta"},{"startMs":663840,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and you would basically follow the coastline and it's a little rough as you're going along these"},{"startMs":669840,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"top of the sinai peninsula because that's quite dry but then once you hit the region of gaza and"},{"startMs":676080,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"move up north then you've got quite a bit of settled territory and a lot of arable land and"},{"startMs":681440,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"you can follow the road all the way up and then down over to the right into mesopotamia the other"},{"startMs":687440,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"route which was also quite widely traveled is the

passable"},{"startMs":711840,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"and then you make a straight shot north up to damascus so it's not nearly as beautiful because"},{"startMs":717920,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"you don't have the mediterranean sea to your left uh at best you have to travel through the"},{"startMs":723040,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"very hot zone of the the dead sea but after that initial burst through the sinai then you've got"},{"startMs":731680,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"fairly clear rest stops along the way lots of gas stations as you make your way to mesopotamia"},{"startMs":737760,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"and so israel was extremely important as these commercial ventures expanded and of course that"},{"startMs":743840,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"becomes a political question as well perhaps what makes israel so important to the rest of the
