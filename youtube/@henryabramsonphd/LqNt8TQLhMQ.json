acharonium"},{"startMs":390720,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"tend to do much more so in my humble opinion than rishonim secondly in terms of their expression"},{"startMs":398560,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"they are almost always written in rabbinic hebrew there's some interesting non-rabbinicki

but"},{"startMs":467280,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"more words helps with the precision and rapid understanding and then third in general they"},{"startMs":474320,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"tend

goes"},{"startMs":609120,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"deeply into the sources once again using the kind of of pragmatic tools to draw out"},{"startMs":618480,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"the theoretical foundations of the decisions as laid down in the tour now amazingly he"},{"startMs":625680,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"went and he wrote commentaries on other great codes such as
