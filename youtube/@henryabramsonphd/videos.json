Rabin’s life was inextricably bound with the relationship of Israel and its Arab neighbors.\nPart XII of the lecture series “ISRAEL: The Land and its People” offered during the Spring 2017 semester at the mighty Avenue J campus of Touro College.

Summoning upon an immense reserve of energy, Nahmanides single-handedly resurrected the community living under Islamic rule and laid the foundation for a Jewish renaissance.\nPart IX of the lecture series “ISRAEL: The Land and its People” offered during the Spring 2017 semester at the mighty Avenue J campus of Touro College.

Jewish Biography as History Dr. Henry Abramson","description":"Detractors and admirers alike called him a \"zealot, the son of a zealot\" a fitting title for arguably the most divisive figure in early eighteenth-century Jewish history. A native son of Jerusalem, Rabbi Moshe Chagiz (1671-1751) originally journeyed to Europe to raise funds for his beleaguered Yeshiva. Within a short period of time, however, he commanded center stage as  a major polemicist in the movement to extirpate all traces of Shabbatai Tzvi's confused legacy in the Jewish community. Chagiz published widely, both his own Rabbinic works and those of others, but he is best known for his aggressive attacks against Jewish heretics, real or perceived. Unfortunately, his zeal for ideological purity ultimately drew him to criticize the activity of a young Kabbalist named Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. R. Chagiz' persistence drove R. Luzzatto into exile and an early death.  History would nevertheless vindicate the victim of Chagiz' calumnies as one of the greatest minds of the Jewish people since the 16th century Safed circle. \n\nAfter the conversion of Shabbetai Tzvi in 1666 and his death a decade later, his eighteenth century followers may be divided into three categories. The core supporters followed Shabbetai Tzvi into Islam. Known as the Doenmeh, they continued to maintain a distinct communal status for centuries. A second group retained Jewish identity, but openly practiced antinomian Sabbatean practices such as the elimination of fast days and radical experimentation with traditional Jewish marital laws. Certainly the most visible and controversial, these Sabbateans attracted the most attention of polemicists. Rabbi Chagiz, however, was especially concerned with a third category, potentially the largest and certainly the most insidious: crypto-Sabbateans. These Jews, often very learned and occupying leadership positions in the community, secretly harbored Sabbatean inclinations and ambitions, hoping to slowly infiltrate key sectors of the Jewish population and ultimately win the community over to the messianic delusion of Shabbetai Tzvi. \n\n\"The Destruction of Sinners\" (1714) was Rabbi Chagiz' first major polemical work, attacking the crypto-Sabbatean Nechemia Chiya Chayon. The text pioneers many techniques that became standard practice for anti-Sabbatean attacks: a relentless search for hidden allusions in the writings of a given Rabbi, the meticulous examination of signatories of his letters of approbation, and the secret collection of testimonies about his personal practice. After a drama that involved several major European communities, R. Chagiz emerged victorious over Chayon. \n\nThe experience was transformative, and R. Chagiz went on to build a virtual career as a type of Jewish Inquisitor. For some, he became a heroic defender of Torah-true Judaism, teaming with other opponents of Shabbetai Tzvi like Chacham Tsvi Ashkenazi and Yaakov Emden. For others, he was the pinnacle of intolerance and a purveyor of artificial controversy. After the success of \"The Destruction of Sinners,\" however, there was no stopping his \"pursuit of heresy\" (the title of a brilliant biography of R. Chagiz by Columbia professor Elisheva Carlebach, whose career includes teaching at Touro College). When news of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto's Kabbalistic circle reached him, R. Chagiz embarked on his final crusade. The highly respected Rabbi Isaiah Bassan, teacher to R. Luzzatto since his youth, shielded him from the most egregious charges of crypto-Sabbateanism, through R. Luzzatto was coerced into signing an oath severely limiting his public teaching. After wandering through Europe, R. Luzzatto journeyed to Israel where the ban on his activity did not apply, ultimately dying a premature death.  The victory of R. Chagiz was a tragic loss for the Jewish intellectual tradition.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6RzWVRgY3Dw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6RzWVRgY3Dw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6RzWVRgY3Dw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6RzWVRgY3Dw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6RzWVRgY3Dw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Henry Abramson","playlistId":"UUeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","position":631,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6RzWVRgY3Dw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Henry Abramson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"XObQY4Tpulie4Tm7-7g9ItZFbvI","id":"VVVlTnI2Z3dxaW5fN2VfYXRqVm5KY0NRLlBEQzlnOTZWSDFj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-03-09T17:43:27Z","channelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","title":"Who Was Pinhas Hurwitz? Jewish Biography as History Dr. Henry Abramson","description":"Two hundred years ago, Sefer Ha-Brit was a fixture in the library of every educated Jewish home. First published anonymously in 1797, this hugely popular 800-page tome appeared in forty editions, including translations into Ladino and Yiddish. It was widely read by Ashkenazim and Sefardim, western and eastern European Jews, Hasidim, Mitnagdim and Maskilim with equal enthusiasm. Indeed, the author's initial decision to hide his identity sparked rumors that the book was written by figures as diverse as the Vilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn. After a poorly produced pirated edition appeared in 1801, however, the author revealed his identity in an expanded second edition. His name was Pinchas Hurwitz of Vilna, and his unique passion for both Lurianic Kabbalah and modern science ultimately articulated a theological space for Jewish identity in the modern world. \n\nDespite its longevity through the 19th century, Sefer Ha-Brit has not retained its universal popularity over the last fifty years. This is probably because the first half of the book is dedicated to an exuberant survey of the scientific world as it existed at the end of the eighteenth century. Modern readers would find this information about subjects like the technology of hot air balloons quaint, but only specialists in the history of science would read it seriously today. For traditionalist Jews emerging into a rapidly changing industrial society, however, Sefer ha-Brit represented an accessible, authoritative, and religiously kosher view of modern science, and its endorsement by leading Rabbinic figures guaranteed its widespread adoption by intellectually curious Jewish readers. \n\nA recent study of Sefer Ha-Brit by distinguished University of Pennsylvania historian David Ruderman explores the larger significance of Hurwitz' work, arguing that scholars have underestimated the importance of Sefer Ha-Brit. Ostensibly, Rabbi Hurwitz was inspired by Safed thinker Rabbi Chaim Vital's Classic work of Kabbalistic ethics, Shaarei Kedushah (discussed in this column: see http://5tjt.com/the-gates-of-holiness/). At first glance, the rapid pace of scientific change represented a grave intellectual challenge to religious piety: given the demonstrable successes of the scientific worldview, what hope of survival would traditional Judaism have for the future? Borrowing from contemporary philosopher Immanuel Kant's decisive attack on accepted wisdom, Rabbi Hurwitz confidently proposed a theological posture that consisted of two distinct elements. First, the euphoria associated with scientific discovery must be tempered by the realization that later scholars will ultimately refine and even reverse these \"laws of nature,\" just as Newtonian physics replaced Aristotelian models, and would in turn be superseded by Einstein's theories. Ultimate truth may only be found in faith, eternally outside the dimensions of empirical measurement. Second, scientific discovery should be received by Jews with open hearts and open minds, recognizing the advance of secular knowledge as the gradual unfolding of Divine wisdom, \"the wonders of the Creator.\" This twofold proposition, a remarkable combination of contemporary science and Lurianic Kabbalah, created an intellectual space suitable for the adaptation of Jews to the modern world without sacrificing religious integrity. \n\nWhile the first half of Sefer Ha-Brit is of great value to intellectual historians, the second half remains directly relevant to a much wider audience. Rabbi Hurwitz was deeply concerned with the state of Jewish society, and the second part--significantly expanded after his work was produced in a plagiarized edition in 1801--was a large, substantive discussion of traditional Jewish ethics. Of particular value was the section entitled \"Ahavat Re'im,\" in which Rabbi Hurwitz argued that the commandment to \"love your neighbor as your self\" should be understood as a broader directive to respect and hold the dignity of all human beings. Professor Ruderman points out that Rabbi Hurwitz' moral cosmopolitanism reached further than most commentators, who tended to interpret this verse more narrowly. Rabbi Hurwitz' wide experience with diverse populations, undoubtedly a result of his extensive European travels, inspired him to promote a more expansive view of human society. Ahavat Re'im was published as a stand-alone work several times after Rabbi Hurwitz passed away in 1821. \n\nDr. Henry Abramson is a specialist in Jewish History and Thought, serving as Dean on the Avenue J campus of Touro College.

Jewish Biography as History Dr. Henry Abramson","description":"Living under the Portuguese Inquisition, Uriel da Costa (1583-1640) fled with his family to Amsterdam to reclaim his Jewish heritage. Tragically, the years of attempting to reconstruct authentic Judaism under the scrutiny of a zealous Church led him, like many crypto-Jews of his generation, to basic misunderstandings about the fundamental ideas and practices of his ancestral religion.  A combination of a personal struggle with mental illness and an inability to accept the discrepancy between his imagined Judaism and the way it was actually practiced led him to become an outspoken critic of Jewish leadership as he wandered between Amsterdam, Hamburg and Utrecht. He was censured with repeated excommunication, and ultimately took his own life in 1640 after penning a brief autobiographical statement cataloguing his inner spiritual conflict. His writings are brief and confused, but they had a significant impact on the work of Baruch Spinoza, whose own conflict with traditional Judaism paralleled da Costa's in many ways.

Few listeners are aware, however, that the syrupy, commercialized versions of holiday cheer have their origins in the musical genius of a Jewish immigrant from Siberia, the phenomenal Irving Berlin. Whatever we may think of the 21st century interpretations of his work, it is undeniable that Berlin had the amazing ability to express the core values of American culture in a way that transcended religious ideology.\n\nHeres some additional notes from Dr. Carl Singer:\n\nHis actions were acknowledged with such accolades as the Army's Medal of Merit from President Truman in 1945; a Congressional Gold Medal for \"God Bless America\" and other patriotic songs from President Eisenhower in 1954; and the Freedom Medal from President Ford in 1977. In 2002, the U.S. Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, named the Army Entertainment Division (AED) World Headquarters \"The Irving Berlin Center\" in his honor. Also that year he was commemorated on a U.S. postage stamp.\n\nhttp://www.rnh.com/bio/81/Berlin-Irving\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_recipients   received 1977\n\n\nIrving Berlin \"God Bless America\" - The Ed Sullivan Show   God Bless America     Irving Berlin on Ed Sullivan May 5, 1968\n\nIrving Berlin - 'Oh, How I Hate to get up in the Morning'   Oh how I hate to get up in the morning  1943  \"this is the Army\"\n\nKate Smith, God Bless America        Kate Smith - God Bless America  introducing \"a new song\"\n\n---------\nI believe there was a slight error towards the end of the presentation:  \"Congressional Medal of Honor\" -- is likely a misnomer.  To the best of my knowledge there is no such medal.\nThere is the Congressional Gold Medal.   The \"Medal of Honor\" (no \"Congressional\") is the nation's highest military award.\n\nThat said -- I've really enjoyed the three presentations that I have listened to thus far:  I.B. Singer,  Shalom Alechem & Irving Berlin.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKRXyBgDw70/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKRXyBgDw70/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKRXyBgDw70/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKRXyBgDw70/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Henry Abramson","playlistId":"UUeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","position":673,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TKRXyBgDw70"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Henry Abramson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"snXIcrvEtH3swKJtOIBR49SjnIE","id":"VVVlTnI2Z3dxaW5fN2VfYXRqVm5KY0NRLjFHc3ZMUDZmbXBN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-12-04T19:53:39Z","channelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","title":"Who Was Aaron of Lincoln?

Conceived as a vehicle for world peace, Esperanto is even regarded by the Oomoto religion of Japan as the \"language of heaven.\" IMPORTANT NOTE: I totally blew one part of this video: I was so delighted to find a video clip of Zamenhof himself that I didn't really think about the dates--it's obviously a video of an actor portraying Zamenhof, not the real person. Oy! Still, the video is useful, I think.  Thanks to all the viewers who caught this error.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwAFan_NZTw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwAFan_NZTw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwAFan_NZTw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwAFan_NZTw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwAFan_NZTw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Henry Abramson","playlistId":"UUeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","position":741,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FwAFan_NZTw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Henry Abramson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"3LFi2ZtL3_rhGa7mb55scwieFrg","id":"VVVlTnI2Z3dxaW5fN2VfYXRqVm5KY0NRLmJ0VC1YZHoxUGNj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-12-03T19:46:30Z","channelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","title":"Origins of Polish Jewry This Week in Jewish History Dr. Henry Abramson","description":"This week marks the death anniversary of King Boleslaw V (The Chaste) in 1279.

His analysis of the overall demographic impact of the attacks has been challenged by modern scholarship, but Hanover's powerful treatment of the martyrdom of Ukrainian Jewry made a powerful impact on Jewish memory for centuries.\n\nSupport our Students!\nThe Friends of Jewish History: https://www.crowdrise.com/the-friends-of-jewish-history/fundraiser/avenuej\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JewishHistoryatJ/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hmabramson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sjfIKWlbGTc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sjfIKWlbGTc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sjfIKWlbGTc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sjfIKWlbGTc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sjfIKWlbGTc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Henry Abramson","playlistId":"UUeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","position":819,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sjfIKWlbGTc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Henry Abramson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"pvLNOwsOrgCXrkxBGwq52Y6wwNA","id":"VVVlTnI2Z3dxaW5fN2VfYXRqVm5KY0NRLkpJOTNyWlpqUUFV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-02-18T16:47:16Z","channelId":"UCeNr6gwqin_7e_atjVnJcCQ","title":"Rabbi Moshe Cordovero and the Tomer Devorah Dr. Henry Abramson","description":"This video concentrates on the life and work of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (1522-1570), a prominent Kabbalist of Safed, Israel.
