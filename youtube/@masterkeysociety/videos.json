Shinn believes that by choosing our words carefully and with intention, we can create positive outcomes in our lives. Each chapter in the book tackles a specific area of life, such as success, prosperity, happiness, love, and health, and offers affirmations to manifest positive change in that area.\n\nShinn stresses that what we verbalize becomes our reality. Positive affirmations and declarations can shape our circumstances and guide our lives toward abundance and happiness. Throughout the book, Shinn provides numerous affirmations designed to help readers overcome fears, limitations, and negative beliefs. These affirmations are meant to be spoken aloud and internalized to bring about positive change. Shinn emphasizes the importance of having faith in a higher power (often referred to as the \"Infinite Intelligence\" or \"Christ within\") and trusting our intuition to guide us. By tapping into this inner guidance, we can make better decisions and move closer to our desires. Even though she doesn't use the term \"law of attraction\" as it's popularly known today, the principles Shinn discusses are closely aligned with this concept. She believes in the magnetic power of thoughts and words, and how they attract events and circumstances in our lives. Many of the obstacles we face, according to Shinn, come from our own fears and doubts. By replacing these with positive affirmations and beliefs, we can overcome challenges and align ourselves with success and happiness. Through positive affirmations and a deep understanding of spiritual laws, Florence Scovel Shinn provides readers with a roadmap to manifest their desires.\n\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:48 - Your Word is Your Wand\n04:53 - Success\n14:02 - Prosperity\n16:59 - Happiness\n20:46 - Love\n22:32 - Marriage\n24:26 - Forgiveness\n24:59 - Words of Wisdom\n27:56 - Faith\n35:27 - Loss\n36:58 - Debt\n38:24 - Sales\n39:26 - Interviews\n39:48 - Guidance\n41:53 - Protection\n42:16 - Memory\n42:27 - Divine Design\n46:03 - Health\n51:39 - Animals\n52:08 - Elements\n53:38 - Journey\n53:50 - Miscellaneous\n1:03:49 - Conclusion\n\nCredits:\nText - Florence Scovel Shinn\nAudio Narration - Sarah Partridge\nVisual Photography and Editing - Brian Dehler\n\n=============================\n\n★Please support this channel by checking out Gaia:\nhttps://www.gaia.com/portal/masterkeysociety\nWhat is Gaia? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_gaia\nWhat kind of movies does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_films\nWhat kind of TV shows does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_TV\n\n=============================\n\n★Get the Paperback\nhttps://amzn.to/3PgkmoL\n\n=============================\n\nThis YouTube book is copyright ©2023 Master Key Society\n\nGeneral Disclaimer:\nThis recording is a production of Master Key Society for the purpose of research and study.

Composed in 1916, these seven sermons convey some of Jung's most complex and profound ideas, inspired by Gnostic traditions.\n\nIn this portion of the work, Jung stages a dialogue with the \"dead,\" representing departed souls visiting his home in Zurich, driven by a spiritual quest to understand God. It provides a framework for Jung to delve into his groundbreaking concepts on the nature of the psyche, individuation, the reconciliation of opposites, and the spiritual dimensions of human existence.\n\nThe sermons touch upon a series of interconnected and layered concepts:\n 1 Abraxas: A god who transcends the duality of good and evil, embodying both attributes.\n 2 Pleroma: A state of perfect fullness and unity where all opposites are reconciled and from which existence originates.\n 3 Individuation: The process of becoming a complete, self-realized individual, highlighting the interplay between conscious and unconscious components of the psyche.\n 4 Love and Desire: Their intrinsic roles in human spiritual development and the unfolding of individual existence.\n 5 Magic: As a counterpart to the inward journey of individuation, presenting the objective pursuit of this process.\n 6 Good and Evil: The exploration of these concepts as relative and reconcilable within the larger whole represented by Abraxas.\n 7 The Nature of Man: Man as a bridge between the spiritual and the physical, and the importance of embodiment in the process of individuation.\n\nThese sermons mark an exploration of the deeper layers of the psyche and constitute a significant stepping stone in Jung's development of analytical psychology. However, given the depth and complexity of these concepts, a deeper reading and study of the sermons are essential to fully understand and appreciate Jung's ideas.\n\nFor additional Commentary and explanation, visit:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgOrK0kIYn9LMz8GdGB99UIIu5juYWoX\n\n=============================\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:38 - Sermon 1\n12:12 - Sermon 2\n16:42  - Sermon 3\n21:00  - Sermon 4\n26:02 - Sermon 5\n31:01 - Sermon 6\n33:33 - Sermon 7\n\n=============================\n\nCredits:\nText - Carl Gustav Jung\nAudio Narration - Adam Hanin\nVisual Photography and Editing - Brian Dehler\n\nThis YouTube book is copyright ©2023 Master Key Society\n\n=============================\n\n★Please support this channel by checking out Gaia:\nhttps://www.gaia.com/portal/masterkeysociety\nWhat is Gaia? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_gaia\nWhat kind of movies does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_films\nWhat kind of TV shows does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_TV\n\n=============================\n\n★Get the Paperback of Jung’s ‘The Red Book’ which contains the 7 sermons of the Dead:\nhttps://amzn.to/3N5Aic7\n\n=============================\n\nGeneral Disclaimer:\nThis recording is a production of Master Key Society for the purpose of research and study.

The book is a study of the nature of reality and the principles that govern the universe, and offers practical advice for living a fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\nAt the core of the book is the idea that the universe is a dynamic and interconnected system, and that all things are connected and interdependent. Fersen argues that by understanding the fundamental principles of the universe, we can learn to live in harmony with nature and create lives of abundance and fulfillment.\n\nThroughout the book, Fersen explores a range of topics, including the nature of consciousness, the role of thought in shaping reality, and the importance of personal responsibility. He offers a unique perspective on the nature of reality and offers practical advice for living a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nBaron Eugene Fersen was the eldest son of a Grand Duchess of Russia/Poland, known as Marie Olga Alexandrovna Medem of the Royal House of Medem and DeLacy. An influential writer and lecturer, he came to the United States in 1904 to share his teachings and lessons known as the Science of Being. He founded the Lightbears Organization in 1921 with a mission to show people, regardless of Race, Nationality, Creed, or Belief, how to obtain the finest and best out of life Physically, Mentally, and Spiritually with abundance and Harmony in all three areas. \n\nOne of the messages of this book is to KNOW THYSELF. To That, Eugene Fersen wrote:\n\n“This is a very old saying, and highly regarded, especially by the Greeks who laid stress on knowledge. So important that they had it carved in marble over the entrance of their temples.\n\n    It is through evolution of one’s own mind that knowledge is increased, and the more we throw the Light within ourselves, the clearer we see things without. We must be ourselves enlightened before we can enlighten others. Self-knowledge is the greatest knowledge; yet how few today realize that. We take so little trouble to study ourselves. There are thousands of scientists who study everything from worlds as a whole to microbes and don’t know anything about themselves. The majority that study outside phenomena know hardly anything of themselves.\n\n    If human beings would study themselves, that self-knowledge would give them the key to all else. As it says in the Bhagavad Gita- “the greatest science is the science of self.” If human beings through their highest representatives could have tried to know themselves, humanity would not be today a bunch of “could-be’s,” but “aren’ts.”\n\n    That is why we have that motto, for it explains exactly the Science of Being, it explains the aim, the means, and the law through which the aim is achieved. It shows us the start and gives us an idea of the finish. It is the most wonderful statement, which any human being could utter, and in taking the best of everything to join into one harmonious whole, we naturally took it.” - Eugene Fersen\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Bookcase\n00:53 - Introduction\n01:54 - Lesson One\n01:17:01 - Lesson Two\n01:58:31 - Lesson Three\n03:06:33 - Lesson Four\n03:53:52 - Lesson Five\n05:26:47 - Lesson Six\n06:31:17 - Lesson Seven\n\nCredits:\nText - Eugene Fersen\nAudio Narration - Sarah Partridge\nVisual Photography and Editing - Brian Dehler\n\nThis YouTube book is copyright ©2022 Master Key Society\n\n=============================\n\n★Please support this channel by checking out Gaia:\nhttps://www.gaia.com/portal/masterkeysociety\nWhat is Gaia? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_gaia\nWhat kind of movies does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_films\nWhat kind of TV shows does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_TV\n\n=============================\n\n★Get the Paperback\nhttps://amzn.to/3OKjI2z\n\n=================================================\n\nGeneral Disclaimer:\nThis recording is a production of Master Key Society for the purpose of research and study.

Hall","description":"Summary: The Initiates of the Flame is a little essay on the mystery of fire. To all ancient peoples fire was a symbol of the divine One dwelling in the innermost parts of all things. Robert Fludd, a Rosicrucian mystic, writing in the seventeenth century, declared that the fire of the philosophers was divided into three parts: first, a visible fire which is the source of physical light and heat; second, an invisible, or astral fire, which enlightens and warms the soul; third, a spiritual, or divine fire which in the universe is known as God and in man as spirit.\n\nThe Initiates who took their oaths in the presence of the Flame renounced the lesser concerns of ordinary life and, freed from the attachments of this material sphere, these purified souls became custodians of that symbolic Flame of wisdom which is the true Light of the world. This Light is a manifestation of the one Universal Life, that active agent whose impulses are the cause of all sidereal phenomena. Where in antiquity this flame of light, this spirit-fire, was the object of a universal adoration and was worshipped as the very presence of God Himself, it now lies buried beneath the ruins of man's fallen temple. Obscured by the paramount interests of the flesh, it emits but the faintest gleam in this non-philosophic age. \n\n- Manly P.

He explains how, through visualization and meditation, you can use the power of your imagination to create your reality.\n\n“The cornerstone on which all things are based is man’s concept of himself. He acts as he does and has the experiences that he does, because his concept of himself is what it is, and for no other reason. Had he a different concept of self, he would act differently. A change of concept of self automatically alters his future: and a change in any term of his future series of experiences reciprocally alters his concept of self. Man’s assumptions which he regards as insignificant produce effects that are considerable; therefore man should revise his estimate of an assumption, and recognize its creative power.” - Neville\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:38 - Out of this World\n22:25 - Assumptions Become Facts\n34:39 - Power of Imagination\n46:41 - No One To Change But Self\n\nCredits:\nText - Neville Goddard\nAudio Narration - Adam Hanin\nVisual Photography and Editing - Brian Dehler\n\nThis YouTube book is copyright ©2022 Master Key Society\n\n=============================\n\n★Please support this channel by checking out Gaia:\nhttps://www.gaia.com/portal/masterkeysociety\nWhat is Gaia? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_gaia\nWhat kind of movies does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_films\nWhat kind of TV shows does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_TV\n\n=============================\n\n★Get the Paperback\nhttps://amzn.to/3Nd2JoV\n\n=============================\n\nGeneral Disclaimer:\nThis recording is a production of Master Key Society for the purpose of research and study.

Leadbeater","description":"Summary: Thought Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation, is based on the idea that ‘thoughts are things’ and that a person's emotions emit colorful auras of pattern and form. Charles Leadbeater and Annie Besant attempt to help us conceive this truth by describing their clairvoyant observations to painters who produced the 58 illustrations contained in the book and then by providing their interpretations of those illustrations.\n\nAt the core of the book is the idea that thoughts are not just abstract mental concepts, but are real and tangible forms that have a powerful influence on the physical world. The authors argue that every thought we have creates a corresponding \"thought form\" that exists in the ether and has a real and tangible impact on the world around us.\n\nThroughout the book, the authors explore the different types of thought forms that exist, including those that are positive and negative, and those that are related to different emotions and states of consciousness. They also offer practical advice for using the power of thought to create positive change in the world.\n\nCharles Leadbeater and Annie Besant wrote that, “It is well for us ever to bear in mind that there is a hidden side to life—that each act and word and thought has its consequence in the unseen world which is always so near to us, and that usually these unseen results are of infinitely greater importance than those which are visible to all upon the physical plane.”\n\nThought Forms is considered to have had a major influence on abstract artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Hilma Af Klint, and Paul Klee. \n\nAnnie Besant was a well respected orator, writer, social rights activist, and president of the Theosophical Society based in Adyar, Chennai, India from 1907 to her death in 1933. Charles Webster Leadbeater was  known for his writings, his clairvoyant observations, and his raising and educating of Jiddu Krishnamurti. Leadbeater went on to write over 60 books and pamphlets and gave lectures until his death in 1934.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Foreword\n00:42 - Introduction\n09:02 - The Difficulty of Representation\n16:34 - The Two Effects of Thought\n19:15 - How The Vibration Acts\n22:17 - The Form and Its Effect\n32:05 - The Meaning of the Colours\n37:34 - Three Classes of Thought-Forms\n45:45 - Affection\n53:04 - Devotion\n01:02:10 - Intellect\n01:06:15 - Ambition\n01:07:36 - Anger\n01:12:10 - Sympathy\n01:12:45 - Fear\n01:14:26 - Greed\n01:17:03 - Various Emotions\n01:32:03 - Forms Seen in Meditation\n01:47:09 - Helpful Thoughts\n01:49:24 - Forms Built by Music\n\nCredits:\nText - Annie Besant and C.W.

The book explores the idea that a person's thoughts have a powerful influence on their circumstances and experiences in life. The central premise of the book is that our thoughts shape our character and determine the quality of our lives. Allen argues that by controlling our thoughts and focusing on positive, uplifting ideas, we can transform our lives and achieve success and happiness. The book also discusses the importance of taking responsibility for our thoughts and actions, and the role that self-discipline and determination play in achieving our goals.\n\nBorn in England 1864, James Allens father was struggling in the textiles business, his father traveled to New York City to seek employment when Allen was 15 years old. Sadly, he was robbed and murdered just days after his arrival. Allen was forced to leave school and worked to help support the household. Holding onto the intelectual practice of reading and writing that his father instilled in him, Allen studied his fathers books on ethics, religion and philosophy during his lunch breaks and well into the evenings. Feeling stuck and without direction, he was striving to find purpose and meaning for life. In 1889, Allen found new employment outside of the factory working as a secretary and continued to contemplate the world religions and it became clear to him that the underlying message was self-development and inner refinement. He began writing his own thoughts and in 1903, Allen wrote As a Man Thinketh to encapsulate the idea that our thoughts are causative and that thought is the cause of oneself. The title may have been inspired by the proverb, “As he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” \n\nJames Allen writes from personal life experiences of mental building himself up and out of despair and the struggle he experienced as a youth. From the publication of this book forward he would publish a book a year until his death in 1912. This book would go on to inspire Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, Marxus Garvey, and many others. By directing our thoughts toward greatness and achieving personal goals, he teaches that we don’t attract what we want so much as we attract what we are.\n\nAs James Allen wrote himself, \"This little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject of the power of thought. It is suggestive rather than explanatory, its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and perception of the truth that “They themselves are makers of themselves” by virtue of the thoughts which they choose and encourage; that mind is the master weaver, both of the inner garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in enlightenment and happiness.\"\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:30 - Thought and Character\n06:11 - Effect of Thought on Circumstances\n24:51 - Effect of Thought on Health and the Body\n28:56 - Thought and Purpose\n33:27 - The Thought-Factor in Achievement\n39:12 - Visions and Ideals\n46:18 - Serenity\n\nCredits:\nText - James Allen\nAudio Narration - Randy Scott\nVisual Photography and Editing - Brian Dehler\n\nThis YouTube book is copyright ©2021 Master Key Society\n\n=============================\n\n★Please support this channel by checking out Gaia:\nhttps://www.gaia.com/portal/masterkeysociety\nWhat is Gaia? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_gaia\nWhat kind of movies does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_films\nWhat kind of TV shows does Gaia have? https://bit.ly/mstrkey_TV\n\n=============================\n\n★Get the Paperback\nhttps://amzn.to/41JJB6I\n\n=============================\n\nGeneral Disclaimer:\nThis recording is a production of Master Key Society for the purpose of research and study.

Haanel","description":"Summary: The Master Key System is a personal development book by Charles F. Haanel (1866–1949). It was originally released as a 24-week correspondence course in 1912, and then published in book form in 1916. Each of the 24 chapters contains an introduction, an exercise, and a concludes with questions and answers.\n\nThe book is a set of lessons that cover a wide range of topics, including the power of thought, the laws of success, and the nature of the universe.\n\nAt the core of the book is the idea that the universe is governed by certain laws, and that we can harness these laws to achieve success and abundance in our lives. Haanel argues that by understanding and applying these principles, we can tap into an unlimited source of power and create the lives we desire.\n\nThroughout the book, Haanel explores a range of topics, including the power of concentration, the role of the subconscious mind, and the importance of goal setting. He also offers practical exercises and techniques that readers can use to apply these principles in their own lives.\n\nIn 1919, Napoleon Hill wrote a letter to Charles F. Haanel about the influence that The Master Key System had on him. In the letter Hill wrote “I believe in giving credit where it is due, therefore I believe I ought to inform you that my present success and the success which has followed my work as President of the Napoleon Hill Institute is due largely to the principles laid down in The Master-Key System.”\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:32 - Part One\n16:51 - Part Two\n32:56 - Part Three\n47:11 - Part Four\n01:02:16 - Part Five\n01:16:46 - Part Six\n01:30:42 - Part Seven\n01:47:55 - Part Eight\n02:05:15 - Part Nine\n02:23:26 - Part Ten\n02:39:21 - Part Eleven\n02:54:45 - Part Twelve\n03:09:51 - Part Thirteen\n03:25:46 - Part Fourteen\n03:40:24 - Part Fifteen\n03:55:04 - Part Sixteen\n04:10:40 - Part Seventeen\n04:26:17 - Part Eighteen\n04:39:13 - Part Nineteen\n04:52:35 - Part Twenty\n05:08:08 - Part Twenty-One\n05:24:07 - Part Twenty-Two\n05:39:31 - Part Twenty-Three\n05:54:54 - Part Twenty-Four\n06:12:18 - Questions and Answers\n06:33:52 - End\n\nCredits:\nText - Charles F.

I encourage you to listen to several lessons at first, just to get a feel for Napoleon Hill's language and delivery. Then return to the beginning, prepared to take notes - starting and stopping the program as needed. Be patient. For me, I spent several months reflecting on just the first principle alone. I applied it to my life and paid close attention to how it influenced my daily decisions and actions. Then I moved onto the second principle, and so on. \n\nBefore you begin, I want to call your attention to Hill's first principle, Definiteness of Purpose. \n\nDefiniteness of Purpose is the starting point of all achievement and, for many students, it is the most challenging principle to apply. In Chapter One, Napoleon Hill will instruct you to apply this principle by completing the three following tasks: \n\n1. \"Write down what you most desire in life - what is it that you want?\"\n\n2. \"Write down what you are willing to give in return for that desire.\"\n\n3. Memorize and repeat your answers. Repeat them as statements, with regularity, and with an expression of gratitude.\n\nThis Definiteness of Purpose principle is often misinterpreted as only relating to that first question - \"What do I want?\" It is necessary that you understand that the application of Hill's Definiteness of Purpose Principle is the combination of all three of Hill's instructions. The first two questions, \"What do I want?\" and \"What will I give?\" are equally important if you intend to put this principle into action. \n\nIf you cannot immediately provide answers to these questions, then I encourage you to begin by reflecting on Hill’s second question: \"What are you going to give?\" This question is about your passion and your contribution to life. It is about expressing your unique gifts and talents that aim to serve others in a positive way. To help you answer that question, consider the following.\n\nWhat are the things that you like to do that provide you with a feeling of fulfillment and happiness? What are the things that other people see and recognize in you? If you had unlimited access to time and money, what would you do with your life that would benefit and contribute to others? You should consider that every living thing in this world is here to contribute and express something of unique value. \n\nAs humans, we have the potential to use our minds to live a life of our own choosing and to labor towards whatever ends we desire. For you, that may be in the form of creating, supporting, writing, constructing, inventing, teaching, or perhaps leading and inspiring others. When you decide how you will serve life in a way that is fulfilling and makes you feel happy, then you have found your PURPOSE, and you will be ready to receive what comes in return. \n\nTherefore, once you have answered the question of what you are willing to give, then it is time to answer what it is that you are willing to receive in return. What do you want from life? What do you most desire that will define your definition of success? When you have answered this question, then you have set for yourself a GOAL. From this point forward, you are living a successful life when you make regular progress toward that GOAL and act on PURPOSE and with passion. The 13 lessons that Napoleon Hill includes in this video will guide you on that path, by providing you with direction and instruction for your great journey toward success.\n\nAnd remember, that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.\nThrough cosmic habit force, the law of attraction takes hold and thoughts become things.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:54 - Definiteness of Purpose\n10:11 - The Master Mind Principle\n19:56 - Going the Extra Mile\n29:33 - Applied Faith\n40:16 - Pleasing Personality\n50:16 - Self-Discipline\n59:46 - Positive Mental Attitude\n1:08:14 - Enthusiasm\n1:18:20 - Personal Initiative\n1:28:59 - Learning from Adversity\n1:41:43 - Creative Imagination\n1:51:29 - Accurate Thinking\n2:01:20 - Cosmic Habit Force","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfqDvi8b4gg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfqDvi8b4gg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfqDvi8b4gg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfqDvi8b4gg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfqDvi8b4gg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Master Key Society","playlistId":"UUXEns75ExsEwvw6UNmOQcNQ","position":26,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JfqDvi8b4gg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Master Key Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCXEns75ExsEwvw6UNmOQcNQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"o3IJyzr97Pwhp67T3-nUT6Pykp0","id":"VVVYRW5zNzVFeHNFd3Z3NlVObU9RY05RLlZ4aEd5cUxJLU5j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-11-28T06:00:13Z","channelId":"UCXEns75ExsEwvw6UNmOQcNQ","title":"Napoleon Hill - Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) - RARE LIVE LECTURE","description":"Authorized by the Napoleon Hill Foundation, these rare audio recordings were provided to us under license for exclusive distribution on YouTube.
