She holds a BFA in Printmaking from the Maryland Institute College of Art and an MA in Southern Studies from the University of Mississippi. Amy built the documentary program at the Southern Foodways Alliance, headquartered at the University of Mississippi, where she served as their lead oral historian for more than a decade. Her latest project is “Houston in 2020: Self-Employed Black Artists” and is funded by a grant from the Houston Arts Alliance. Amy’s first book, co-authored with Martha Hall Foose and published by Chronicle Books, A Good Meal Is Hard to Find: Storied Recipes from the Deep South, was released in April 2020 and is being celebrated as \"one of the most unique art volumes this spring [that] doubles as a cookbook.\" \n\nAMY’S WEBSITE: https://www.amycevans.com/\nISRAEL McCLOUD’S WEBSITE: https://www.israelmccloudstudio.com/\n\nTITLE: MEMORIAL MURALS\nAmy C. Evans is an award-winning artist, writer, and oral historian whose most recent project is “Houston in 2020: Self-Employed Black Artists,” a multimedia project documenting the impact of current sociopolitical, economic, and cultural factors on five Black artists in the Bayou City. Meet one of those artists, Israel McCloud, a 4th-generation muralist and sign painter who believes that he has a responsibility to use his work as a mechanism for change. Three of his most recent murals were created in the summer of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic,  and are documents of violence and injustice, pain and loss. His work is part of a long tradition of artists memorializing significant cultural events in community spaces.\n\n\nFollow Archaeology Now Houston\nhttp://archaeologynow.org/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ArchaeologyNowHouston/\nhttps://twitter.com/archaeologyhou\nhttps://bit.ly/2XfhcFl","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ2e36VB9Q0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ2e36VB9Q0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ2e36VB9Q0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ2e36VB9Q0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ2e36VB9Q0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Archaeology Now","playlistId":"UUXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA","position":42,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iJ2e36VB9Q0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Archaeology Now","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Co1ODERnIO7bQWreXQNURjBUnyo","id":"VVVYSTZNazlyMVFqaFBmWncwTktsQkFBLmFVeGhQUVotN1pV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-09-08T18:16:06Z","channelId":"UCXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA","title":"The Tale Behind: Hedgehogs | Dr. Carolyn Willekes","description":"Follow Archaeology Now Houston\nhttp://archaeologynow.org/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ArchaeologyNowHouston/\nhttps://twitter.com/archaeologyhou\nhttps://bit.ly/2XfhcFl","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aUxhPQZ-7ZU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aUxhPQZ-7ZU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aUxhPQZ-7ZU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aUxhPQZ-7ZU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aUxhPQZ-7ZU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Archaeology Now","playlistId":"UUXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA","position":43,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"aUxhPQZ-7ZU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Archaeology Now","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mkVSmlZ-3BwHyo2Mr0POLlOKFVE","id":"VVVYSTZNazlyMVFqaFBmWncwTktsQkFBLm5PbWhUdFhXcHcw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-09-02T16:00:15Z","channelId":"UCXI6Mk9r1QjhPfZw0NKlBAA","title":"Sailing Like a Viking | Tiny Lectures w/ Louise Henriksen","description":"Intrepid sailors, fierce warriors, the Vikings were also incredible engineers.

Archaeologists are discovering that, as a major trading center, the city was host to visitors from around the Roman world, creating what must have been a vibrant culture.  \n\nDr. Sadie Watson, affiliated with Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA), is currently undertaking a four-year Future Leaders Fellowship: Measuring, maximizing and transforming public benefit from UK Government infrastructure investment in archaeology', focusing on ensuring that public spending on archaeology leads to meaningful and relevant research and genuine community participation. She came to this project after more than 20 years in the field, directing excavations throughout the City of London, with a specialization in Roman London. \n\nDr. Watson was Director of the Bloomberg Excavations, a three-year project that has been termed \"the Pompeii of the North\" because of its significant preservation of innumerable artifacts revealing life in Roman Britain.  Sadie was the guest of Archaeology Now in 2015 when she gave many talks to to over 1,500 students in Houston area schools. \n\nOur grateful thanks to Dr. Sadie Watson for her time and generosity.
