Then the invention of the wheel. Then agriculture, a writing system, mathematics, space travel.\n\nWithin our story, empires rise and fall. Technology progresses. Civilizations are born and die. The human race continues to innovate.\n\nAll of our innovations are built on previous ones. There could be no aqueduct without the arch. There could be no metal plow until someone learned how to mine iron. There could be no light bulb, no smartphone and no computer without first understanding electricity.\n\nOur progress is linear. It's orderly.\n\nBut sometimes an object is discovered that's completely out of place and out of time.\n\nA computer found on a sunken Roman ship. A power plant found in a 100,000-year-old cave.

Each blowing of the trumpet brings a new apocalyptic event. After the seventh trumpet: armageddon.\n\nFor centuries, people have reported low-frequency hums, the crack of thunder on a clear day and the sound of cannon-fire in the middle of nowhere.\n\nMysterious sounds have been heard at the bottom of the ocean and in outer space. And they‚Äôve been heard long before modern machines and industry.\n\nRecently, people have been recording and sharing videos of these loud, unnatural sounds.\n\nAnd some of them?

Local beachcombers are used to seeing dead animals. Seagulls, fish, crabs, even the occasional whale. But they had never seen anything like this.\n\nAnimal experts were brought in to identify it. They were stumped. It looked like part dog, part reptile and part rodent - with the beak of a bird. This animal, whatever it was, became known as the Montauk Monster.\n\nBut where did the Monster come from? \n\nThere could be only one answer. Plum Island.\n\nPlum Island is just a few miles from where the monster was found.\n\nLocals had heard rumors that this was a top-secret government facility that created bioweapons, engineered animal hybrids and maybe even experimented on people.\n\nSounds like a wild theory.\n\nBut then another animal washed up on the beach. Again, it couldn't be identified. And then another animal. And then two more.\n\nIn 2010, the *rumors* about Plum Island seemed to be true when something else was found on the beach.

Woodbridge and nearby Bentwaters - called the Twin Bases were rumored to possess nuclear materials. This was the middle of the Cold War, and tensions were high. \n\nThe threat of nuclear attack, global escalation, and more, sat heavy on the shoulders of Burroughs and his fellow servicemen. But their job was simple: keep themselves, their nation, and their allies safe. \n\nSo, Burroughs conducted his nightly rounds, checking the perimeter for anything that threatened the peace.\nSuddenly, a bright light descended from the sky. Then another. Burroughs watched as the lights fell into the forest surrounding the base.\n\nWhen he and his team arrived to inspect the crash site, they were worried it was a Soviet incursion. But, what they found was far more terrifying than anything the Soviets could think of.\n\n#UFO #Aliens #Rendlesham\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nHybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nMischief\nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSynful\nSnowcrash\nRobinSparkles\nOriginal Jim\n\nThe Why Files Theme Lyrics by\nyoutube.com/@straightjacketspaceman9223\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

I can't imagine your life. You can't walk down the street without being mobbed by adoring fans. You attend power-lunches with your agent. You pose for pictures on the red carpet on your way to collect your third Academy Award. Your life sounds fun.\n\nWait, what? You're not a movie star? That's not your life? Well, maybe not in *this* universe, but there is a universe out there where your life is exactly as I described. \n\nThe \"Many Worlds\" or \"Multiple Universes\" theory says that anything that can possibly happen *does* happen. It just happens in a different reality that exists parallel to our own.\n\nThere's a reality out there somewhere where you're a best-selling author. There's one where you're a Nobel Prize winning scientist who cured cancer.\n\nThere's even a reality out there, where you're an evil dictator plotting to take over the world. And you enforce your will with an army of AI robots that you invented when you were a grad student at Stanford.\n\nYes, some of these alternate realities are more far-fetched than others.

Signals from Beyond the Grave or Beyond the Solar System?\n\nHere‚Äôs the scene. You‚Äôre driving down a secluded road. The only lights come from your headlights. The only sounds you hear are crickets and the hum of the engine. \n\nSuddenly, a mysterious orb of light appears in the distance, floating a few feet above the ground. You get the sense that the light is aware of your presence. It darts around, beckoning you closer.\n\nIt can‚Äôt be another car. There‚Äôs nothing around for miles.\n\nAs you get closer to the light, it vanishes.\n\nFinally, you arrive at a small town and stop at a diner for a bite. You mention your experience to the waitress.\n\nShe smiles and says, ‚ÄúYou saw a ghost light‚Äù. She tells you the story of someone killed on that dark road many years ago. The light has been seen ever since.\n\nGhost lights, or spook lights, are seen all over the world. In some places, they‚Äôre thought to be spirits of the dead. Other places say they‚Äôre portals to another dimension. And others say they‚Äôre signals from another world.\n\nWhatever they are, ghost lights are real. They‚Äôve stumped scientists, skeptics... even governments for a long time. \n\nThey‚Äôre seen by thousands of people every year.

There‚Äôs no proof of Atlantis.\n\n#Atlantis #LostCity #Lemuria\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nHybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSynful\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNavHksmXnA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNavHksmXnA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNavHksmXnA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNavHksmXnA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNavHksmXnA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":20,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WNavHksmXnA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"iOluQDBbTSUp80Zd1fHqNYGnX90","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLnNiQmR0RnFIcXZB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-18T05:24:20Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Cicada 3301 After Files!

Just a few lines of text on an image, posted anonymously. \n\nHello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test.\n\nThere is a message hidden in this image.\n\nFind it, and it will lead you on the road to finding us. We look forward to meeting the few that will make it all the way through.\n\nGood luck.\n\n3301\n\nMany speculated that it was a recruiting tool for the NSA, CIA, MI6, or even the Masons.\n\nBut who was really behind it, and what was its purpose? Did it even have a purpose?\n\nWhether it did or not, it didn‚Äôt matter. Because when you post a puzzle on the internet looking for ‚Äúhighly intelligent people‚Äù, that‚Äôs a challenge that‚Äôs simply *impossible* to resist.\n\nSo, the hunt for Cicada 3301 was on.\n\n#Cicada3301 #Mystery #Cryptography\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nHybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSynful\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://uncovering-cicada.fandom.com/wiki/Uncovering_Cicada_Wiki\n\nNox Populi YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_-mmW9eZJwICp_wImMdsA\n\nhttps://sunnyrabiussunny.com/solution-of-cicada-3301-puzzle/\n\nhttps://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/caesar-cipher\n\nhttps://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/outguess\n\nCicada Reddit:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j/\n\nCode cracking tools:\nhttps://www.boxentriq.com/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301\n\nLiber Primus:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160325135052/http://imgur.com/a/TLp4K\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZfKfkuYwyM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZfKfkuYwyM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZfKfkuYwyM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZfKfkuYwyM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZfKfkuYwyM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":22,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3ZfKfkuYwyM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mR2y67msQHGPXK4ekjw47rdgxiU","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLjE0SW1FbHlaTVVz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-14T07:00:00Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Uncovering the Surprising Link Between Earthquakes and Earth s Axis Shift","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14ImElyZMUs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14ImElyZMUs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14ImElyZMUs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14ImElyZMUs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14ImElyZMUs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"14ImElyZMUs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"OswnkSF2aEjctjI0uiaTGLWuwkg","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLkZWbGw5a19SVVNn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-11T04:42:54Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Ghost Hunting After Files!

Take back your financial freedom today by visiting PDSDEBT.com/files\n\nThe Moon Landing: Stanley Kubrick's Greatest Film | How NASA and Hollywood Fooled the World\n\nStanley Kubrick is considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Of his 13 movies a few are considered classics in their respective genres. Including the black comedy Dr. Strangelove, the highly-quotable anti-war commentary of Full Metal Jacket, and one of the most disturbing and enduring horror films of all time, The Shining.\n\nBut in 1968, Kubrick released \"2001 ‚Äì A Space Odyssey\". This is more than a classic. It's a masterpiece. And widely regarded as one of the best science-fiction films of all time, and probably the most influential.\n\nThis collaboration with science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke tells the story of an alien intelligence that visited Earth in the distant past, and left behind artifacts in the solar system. \n\nThe movie features groundbreaking special effects, which still hold up today.\n\nIn fact, the effects looked so good, that the movie gave the American government an idea. \n\nBillions of tax dollars were invested in the space program but the Soviets were still years ahead of the United States.\n\nNASA desperately needed to get to the moon before Russia, but they knew it was impossible.

Other people close to Woody, including family, friends, and even his therapist claimed that they, too, had experiences with Indrid Cold.\n\nWoody wrote and published a detailed account of his experiences, and never went back on his story. Since the 1960s, the legend of Indrid Cold has become one of the most famous in all of UFO lore. \n\nTaken at face value, this story sounds strange.\n\nBut the *real* story ‚Ä¶ is even stranger.\n\n#UFOs #Aliens #UAPs\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nHybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSynful\nZanythos - Reddit\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nMothman Episode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCUfqwy7bSs\n\nStrange Creatures from Time and Space by John Keel:\nhttps://amzn.to/3JSuock\n\n\nWoody Derenberger interview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7p06V3Jrlk\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

Then something happened and a molecule made a copy of itself.\n\nAnd then another copy and another. Soon these molecules arranged themselves into something called a cell.\n\nThen cells clumped together and multiplied. Organisms were created. Over the next three billion years, the organisms became more complicated and more diverse.\n\n375 million years ago one of those organisms crawled out of the sea.\n\n4 million years ago hominids emerged. Hominids had large brains and advanced cognitive abilities. They could reason, communicate and cooperate.\n\n200,000 years ago, homo sapiens, modern humans appeared. They developed agriculture, organized into civilizations and became masters of the planet.\n\nThe story of humans began a long time ago.

Reid was told the Paiute legend\nof a giant people defeated by the natives near Lovelock, Nevada. The last of the giants met their fiery end deep within the bowels of a cave.\n\nReid‚Äôs belief in this legend stirred great interest in the secrets held within Lovelock Cave.\n\nOfficial excavations were undertaken in both 1912 and 1924 by the University of California, with reports telling of thousands of artifacts being recovered. Of these artifacts, the most puzzling were human remains. Well, they were *almost* human.\n\nSkeletons measuring between eight and ten feet tall were said to be found during the dig. Skeletons belonging to who are now known as ‚ÄúThe Lovelock Giants.‚Äù\n\nLegends of people of enormous size are told across a myriad of cultures, And despite what we‚Äôve been told by *mainstream* science, there *is* evidence to suggest they really existed. The remains of giants have been found all over the United States; and all over the world.\n\nSo why aren‚Äôt these amazing finds on display in any museum? Or taught in any classes? Or mentioned in any history books? \n\nBecause the existence of giants, for some reason, has been covered up.\n\n#Giants #Conspiracy #Smithsonian\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nHybrid\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nSynful\nZanythos - Reddit\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nGiants on Record: America's Hidden History, Secrets in the Mounds and the Smithsonian Files, by by Jim Vieira (Author), Hugh Newman (Author), Ross Hamilton:\nhttps://amzn.to/3D5cAap\n\nThe Why Files | Smithsonian Cover-Up: Ancient Egyptians and Giants in the Grand Canyon:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCYMAs4cqRU\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/4693378/A_TRADITION_OF_GIANTS_The_Elite_Social_Hierarchy_of_American_Prehistory\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/7850699/There_Were_Giants_on_the_Earth\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Powell\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ac%C3%A1mbaro_figures\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-skeletons-smithsonian-idUSL1N2ZG1I0\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Report_Upon_the_Condition_and_Progress_o/IrodAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PP1&printsec=frontcover\n\nChildress Article:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20030607204624/http://www.keelynet.com/unclass/canyon.txt\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

Immerse yourself completely in dynamic battles with an unparalleled combination of realism and approachability. \n\nIt was a sunny afternoon on June 24th, 1947, and Kenneth Arnold was flying his small aircraft over Mineral, Washington. He was heading to Yakima but took a slight detour to look for a lost US Marine Corps plane. If he could find it, he‚Äôd collect a nice reward.\n\nFlying near Mount Rainier, he spotted a shiny object in his plane's mirror. Then, he saw multiple flashes of light. It looked like a group of aircraft, flying in formation. But something was wrong - these 'aircraft' didn't have tails. And they were flying faster than anything he‚Äôd ever seen. After about two minutes, the objects vanished near Mount Adams. \n\nWhen Kenneth landed in Yakima, he immediately told his friends and airport staff about his bizarre experience. By the time he reached Pendleton, Oregon, his story had spread. Reporters were eager to hear it. \n\nIn describing the odd movement of these objects, Kenneth said it was like a teacup saucer skipping across a lake. At that moment, the term ‚Äúflying saucer‚Äù was born.\n\nAnd over the next two weeks, events would unfold that would affect every person on Earth.

Take back your financial freedom today by visiting PDSDEBT.com/files.\n\nBending Time: The Successful Time Travel Experiments using Kozyrev Mirrors\n\nIn December 1990, in a remote village above the Arctic Circle, two Russian scientists embarked on a daring experiment. Their goal was to enhance human ‚Äúsuper-perception‚Äù or ESP.\n\nThey built a device that could shield subjects from electromagnetic interference and amplify their biological energy. The device was a large tube of rolled aluminum with a chair inside.\n\nAs soon as the device was built, strange phenomena occurred around the village. Disc-shaped lights hovered around the lab. Balls of energy appeared and disappeared. The Northern Lights became so bright and vivid that they seemed to take physical shape.\n\nInside the lab, anyone who approached the device felt an unexplainable sense of dread. It took a while to persuade anyone to try it.\n\nWhen the first subject finally sat in the chair, a flash of energy erupted that stunned everyone in the lab.\n\nThe device worked.\n\nBut it maybe worked a little *too* well.\n\nNot only did it boost people‚Äôs psychic abilities, it also enabled them to view any place in the world. And soon, they could view any place in time.\n\nIn fact, these experiments confirmed a theory first proposed in the 1950s. That time, as we know it, doesn‚Äôt exist.\n\n#TimeTravel #Mystery #CIA\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nHybrid\nStephanie\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nZanythos - Reddit\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kosmopoisk\n\nhttps://zerkalakozyreva.ru/chertezhi-zerkal-kozyreva/\n\nCOSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY - PROBLEMS OF NEW COSMOGONY (V.P.Kaznacheev,. –õ.

Huel for sponsoring this video!\n\nAliens & Espionage: Crop Circles and the CIA Coverup\n\nIn 1974 a group of scientists beamed a message into space. The message, meant to be received by an intelligent alien species, described life on Earth.\n\nWritten in simple binary code, and using the most powerful radio telescope on the planet, the message was broadcast to a dense cluster of stars in the constellation of Hercules.\n\nThis exercise was just ceremonial; a way to demonstrate new technology in radio astronomy. Nobody was really expected to receive it. And even if they did, it wouldn't be any time soon. The nearest star in the direction of the broadcast is 25,000 light-years away. \n\nSo, the telescope was tuned to 2380 Megherz, aimed at Hercules, and fired up. The scientists congratulated each other, shook hands, and went on with their lives.\n\nBut 27 years later, something very unexpected happened with that message beamed into deep space.\n\nWe got a reply.\n\n#CIA #CropCircles #Conspiracy\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nHybrid\nStephanie\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\nTimothy Weal\nMessor\nZanythos - Reddit\nOriginal Jim - Reddit\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nA Field Full Of Secrets | Absolute Documentaries:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYISlQm0rcA\n\nThe natural history of Stafford-shire by Robert Plot:\nhttps://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eebo2;idno=A55155.0001.001\n\nhttp://www.circlemakers.org/\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070208193045/http://www.cropcircleinfo.com:80/\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/crop-circles-the-art-of-the-hoax-2524283/\n\nDevice and method for simulation of magnetohydrodynamics\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US20090108682A1/\n\nhttps://grahamhancock.com/author/nassim-haramein/\n\nBook of Enoch:\nhttps://book-ofenoch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/book-of-enoch.pdf\n\nRichard Hall:\nhttps://www.richplanet.net/\n\nhttps://thecroppie.co.uk/2019/04/01/the-doug-dave-conspiracy/\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Julia_set\nCIA Involvement in Crop Circles:\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/60477432/CIA-Involvement-in-Crop-Circles\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR RECORD FROM JOE MCMONEAGLE (CIA):\nhttps://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00791r000200190069-2\n\nhttps://nexusnewsfeed.com/article/unexplained/a-story-about-how-a-non-human-intelligence-outsmarted-a-crop-circle-hoaxer\n\nhttps://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/ciasuseofjournal00unit.pdf\n\nColin Andrew's Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ColinAndrewsAuthor\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2BQyZorSQc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2BQyZorSQc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2BQyZorSQc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2BQyZorSQc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x2BQyZorSQc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":54,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"x2BQyZorSQc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"IkNlFOU26We49kd3cNq-AA3N_ok","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLm1od3N0Qi13YXg4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-19T05:04:11Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Sixth Extinction After Files!

It was to provide early warning and defense against Soviet bombers and missile launches. \n\nBut it wasn't long before NORAD would be monitoring skies around the entire planet.\n\nEarly in the morning, on January 13th, 1996, NORAD contacted Brazilian Air Defense to report an object entering the Earth's atmosphere about 200 miles Northeast of Sao Paolo.\n\nWhen asked what type of object, NORAD said it was \"unidentified\". A few minutes later, it crashed somewhere near the town of Varginha.\n\nThe Brazilian Army and Air Force quickly scrambled to get to the crash site before any civilians did.\n\nBut they were too late. The craft was seen -- and the beings driving the craft: we're gone.\n\nOver the next few days, a series of events would unfold that would change the lives of the people in Varginha forever.\n\nWell, at least the lives of the people who survived.  \n\n\n#UFOs #Aliens #Varginha\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nHybrid\nStephanie\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Varginha_UFO_incident\n\nWatch \"Moment of Contact\":\nhttps://amzn.to/3phkdqm\n\n\"UFO Crash in Brazil Paperback\" by Roger K.

Where is the Ark of the Covenant and what technology did it use?\n\nEven though UFOs are seen everywhere: over the desert, over the ocean, over cities; there's no way to predict when and where they'll show up.\n\nWell, no way except for one: build or detonate a nuclear weapon.\n\nSince the dawn of the atomic age, UFOs have been seen -- and photographed -- during nuclear weapons tests and near nuclear weapons facilities. \n\nThe Ark of the Covenant is one of the most mysterious artifacts in human history. The Ark, a sacred chest made of wood and covered in gold, has been missing since 587 BC. Its last known location was Jerusalem, somewhere under the Temple Mount.\n\nWhat does this have to do with UFOs?\n\nIn 2011, a UFO was hovering over the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It emitted a flash of light, then shot straight up and disappeared into the night sky.\n\nThis could be just a coincidence. But it could be that the craft was looking for the Ark.\n\nThe Ark of the Covenant is an object of extreme religious importance to over 2 billion people. But why would a UFO be looking for it? Because it's the most dangerous weapon of mass destruction ever created.\n\n\n#Mystery #History #ArkoftheCovenant\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nHybrid\nStehanie\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nRunelady\nMischief\nGuilty \nKiam\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56OmlPWDRjs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56OmlPWDRjs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56OmlPWDRjs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56OmlPWDRjs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56OmlPWDRjs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":60,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"56OmlPWDRjs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"-_njrRmP-yNbkW2WdHxG_OLBi4s","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLk1FdlRqaVB1NThz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-04-28T06:14:16Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Martian Mysteries: The After Files!

He grabbed a magnifying glass.\n\nThere was no doubt. On the surface of Mars, 140 million miles from Earth, was a structure in the shape of a human face. \n\nIt was huge; about a mile wide; and showed two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Around the Face were pyramids and structures that didn't look natural. They look like they were built... by someone.\n\nThe following day, NASA held a press conference. Of the thousands of photos sent back from Mars, all anyone asked about was The Face.\n\nWho built it and why? Is it a message from an advanced civilization now long extinct? Is it a religious artifact? Is it solid like the Great Sphinx? Or could it contain chambers like the Great Pyramid?\n\nThen NASA threw cold water on the speculation. They said there was a second photograph of the area taken shortly after.\n\nAnd that photo showed that the face was nothing more than an optical illusion.\n\nSmall problem. That second photo doesn't exist.\n\nSo why did NASA lie?\n\nThe answer to *that* question is in the other pictures.\n\n#NASA #Mars #Conspiracy\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nKotenuki\nHybrid\nWingedSpider\nJschopp\nThe Darkness\nPaul Rohrbaugh\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nLife and Death on Mars by John Brandenburg:\nhttps://amzn.to/40D3YkA\n\nANCIENT ALIENS AND JFK: The Race to the Moon and the Kennedy Assassination by Mike Bara:\nhttps://amzn.to/448Bbaz\n\nHidden Agenda: NASA and the Secret Space Program by Mike Bara:\nhttps://amzn.to/3AONn2R\n\nAncient Aliens on Mars by Mike Bara:\nhttps://amzn.to/42iQ5JF\n\nDark Mission: The Secret History of NASA by Richard C.

They look up and see a creature: almost ten feet tall with massive wings perched on a high tree branch; staring at them with glowing red eyes. Then in an instant, it's gone.\n\nThree days later, just a few miles away, two young couples burst into the local police station. Terrified, they report being chased by a tall man with wings and glowing red eyes.\n\nMore and more people would report seeing a creature that stood on two legs, was at least 8 feet tall, and had wings.\n\nSome said it was half-man, half-bird; others said half-man, half-bat. But that name that stuck was \"The Mothman\".\n\nThough The Mothman terrorized hundreds of people for a year, it never physically harmed anyone.\n\nBut 13 months later, that would change.

Maybe it's your mother or maybe your sister. She starts complaining of headaches and strange tingling sensations in different parts of her body.\n\nHer discomfort escalates. She complains of hallucinations; she starts hearing voices. \n\nThen the seizures begin. She has trouble walking and eating. And maintaining control of her bladder.\n\nThe seizures become violent. She thrashes around her bed for hours. You try to restrain her, but she suddenly has impossible strength.\n\nHer moods become erratic. She swings between fear and anger and sadness. Her speech becomes ragged and deep. She has sudden outbursts where she barks out phrases in Latin and Aramaic; languages she doesn't speak.\n\nThen, for no reason at all, the symptoms suddenly stop. And she's back to her normal self. Frightened and exhausted, but it's still her.\n\nHer doctor can't find anything wrong with her. Psychiatrists and neurologists can't explain what's happening.\n\nThis scenario happens to hundreds of families every year from all over the world; of every different culture and religion.\n\nAnd when this *does* happen to someone you love, and there's nobody else to call; you call an exorcist.\n\n#Exorcism #Mystery #History\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nKotenuki\nHybrid\nStehanie\nThe Darkness\nPaul Rohrbaugh\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Pope's_Exorcist\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Exorcism_of_Roland_Doe\n\nhttps://hopes.stanford.edu/exorcism-and-mental-illness-across-different-cultures/\n\nhttps://skepticalinquirer.org/2021/10/demoniac-who-is-roland-doe-the-boy-who-inspired-the-exorcist/\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/20/the-exorcist-boy-named-magazine\n\nhttps://skeptoid.com/episodes/4248\n\n\"Father Amorth: My Battle Against Satan\" by Father Gabriele Amorth \nhttps://amzn.to/43j8dEr\n\n\"The Devil Is Afraid of Me: The Life and Work of the World's Most Famous Exorcist\" by Father Gabriele Amorth \nhttps://amzn.to/3UoK0Z8\n\n\"An Exorcist Explains the Demonic: The Antics of Satan and His Army of Fallen Angels\" by Father Gabriele Amorth\nhttps://amzn.to/3mlayxU\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ammons_haunting_case\n\nhttps://skepticalinquirer.org/2014/05/the-200-demons-house-a-skeptical-demonologists-report/\n\nAmmons reports:\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1005396-taking-custody-without-a-court-order.html\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1005721-report-to-bishop.html\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1004899-intake-officers-report.html\n\nhttps://adw.org/about-us/resources/request-an-exorcism/\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

The Truth about the Denver International Airport Conspiracy\n\nIt's just a matter of time before it happens. Some catastrophic event that wipes out a large percentage of the Earth's population; and forces the human race to \"reset\".\n\nMaybe one of the 30,000 \"Near Earth Objects\" being tracked by NASA finally hit the Earth. Causing an extinction event on par with what wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nOr Earth's poles finally shift. And, without its magnetic field, the planet is exposed to the raw destructive power of the Sun's radiation.\n\nOr maybe, on his deathbed, a dictator decides to go out in a blaze of glory; and launches his entire nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt's just a matter of time before one of these, or one of another dozen doomsday scenarios plays out.\n\nAnd when that happens, world leaders like the President of the United States and Vice President will be immediately taken to underground facilities designed for this event. Key members of Congress and the military will also be taken to secure locations.\n\nBut what about civilians? There ARE facilities around the world designed to house many thousands of people. But who gets saved while the rest of us are left behind? Who makes that decision?\n\nAnd where are these facilities? Well, I don't know where VIPs go if they live in Europe or Asia, or Australia. But in the United States, these chosen few? They go to Denver.\n\n\n#Mystery #Conspiracy #DenverAirport\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nKotenuki\nHybrid\nStephanie\nThe Darkness\nPaul Rohrbaugh\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQflFk5WAO0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQflFk5WAO0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQflFk5WAO0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQflFk5WAO0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQflFk5WAO0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":74,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NQflFk5WAO0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EBtGzDHQzOTx6WzotsT5BqYa26M","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLmxIX2Z5eUFJbWRZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-24T06:08:39Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Gateway Process: After Files!

They're currently experimenting with brain implant technology. They've even explored genetic engineering to try and *breed* the perfect soldier.\n\nBut those are nothing compared to what happened in 1983; when Lieutenant Colonel Wayne McDonnell submitted a very unusual and detailed report to US Army Intelligence.\n\nIt was called \"Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process\". This is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve an out-of-body experience for the purpose of intelligence gathering.\n\nBut Colonel McDonnell's report went much further than that. An advanced Gateway participant can not just project their consciousness to a different place; They could pull their consciousness completely out of this reality. They could travel anywhere in the universe, and at any point in time.\n\nThe report revealed that our universe doesn't actually exist. It's a construct, created by our mind. By using the Gateway Process, you can exit the construct and see reality for what it really is.\n\nThe 30-page Gateway report was immediately classified for one simple reason: anyone can learn to do it.\n\nEven you.\n\n#CIA #GatewayProcess #TimeTravel\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nKotenuki\nHybrid\nJschopp\nThe Darkness\nPaul Rohrbaugh\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://www.monroeinstitute.org/\n\nReport from CIA:\nhttps://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf\n\nFull CIA report (including the missing page):\nhttps://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20601195/6-full-report.pdf\n\nJourneys Out of the Body by Robert Monroe:\nhttps://amzn.to/3Z1iQse\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/jp59b8/there-is-growing-evidence-that-our-universe-is-a-giant-hologram\n\nThe Secret Daily Teachings:\nhttps://amzn.to/3LFI4cz\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wly9_qN-jZ0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wly9_qN-jZ0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wly9_qN-jZ0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wly9_qN-jZ0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wly9_qN-jZ0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":76,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Wly9_qN-jZ0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"T2jqrCpmIw5n1dRUJsitTEV9wac","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLnloalhEOHdKcGtr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-17T06:19:35Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"After Files!

There were lots of songs that contained hidden messages that you could only hear if you played them backward. \n\nBut *those* messages were placed there intentionally.\n\nSoon, David discovered messages hidden in human speech that were NOT intentional.

Eternal life or unlimited wealth? How about both?\n\nFor that, you need The Philosopher's Stone: known throughout the history of alchemy as a substance that can turn base metals into gold, and grant you eternal life.\n\nThe Book of Aquarius contains the instructions for The Philosopher's Stone. Although the process can take years, the ingredients are simple. You have them in your home right now.\n\nThe Book of Aquarius is derived from many older texts. Including one very mysterious artifact: The Emerald Tablet; which contains not only the recipe for immortality but the secret to everything in the universe.\n\nThis knowledge has been around for centuries but has been suppressed. Until now.\n\nMedieval alchemists received this knowledge from the Arabs a thousand years ago. The Arabs got it from the Egyptians two thousand years before that.\n\nBut the Egyptians received this knowledge 36,000 years ago. From the most advanced culture on Earth.\n\nThe Emerald Tablet comes from Atlantis.\n\n#egypt  #mystery  #atlantis \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nKotenuki\nHybrid\nWingedSpider\nYoutube only:\nJschopp\nThe Darkness\nPaul Rohrbaugh\n\nWRITING/RESEARCH CONTRIBUTOR:\nTed Steffens\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nThe Emerald Tablet: Alchemy of Personal Transformation by Dennis William Hauck:\nhttps://amzn.to/3ZdQyLK\n\nThe Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean by Maurice Doreal:\nhttps://amzn.to/3ZbanmV\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Philosopher%27s_stone\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hermes_Trismegistus\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thoth\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apollonius_of_Tyana\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maurice_Doreal\n\nOutstanding information:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pRYSLAJ7fA\n\nThanks to:\n@Anyextee from adeptinitiates.com (for use of his images and his great research)\n\nThe Book of Aquarius, full text:\nhttps://archive.org/details/TheBookofAquarius\n\nThe Book of Aquarius forums:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120501142845/http://www.thebookofaquarius.com/forum/\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn\n\nThe Emerald Tablet (full text):\n‚ÄòTis true without lying, certain & most true.\nThat which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing.\nAnd as all things have been & arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.\nThe Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.\nThe father of all perfection in the whole world is here.\nIts force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.\nSeparate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry.\nIt ascends from the earth to the heaven & again it descends to the earth & receives the force of things superior & inferior.\nBy this means you shall have the glory of the whole world\n& thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.\nIts force is above all force.

Borders between nations will be dissolved; all religions will be dismantled; and technology will be turned against us.\n\nThe architects of Project Blue Beam will distract us with false flag operations like global pandemics, strange weather events, and news reports of UFOs being shot down all over the world.\n\nWhat's frightening is: the general population will go along with Project Blue Beam, willingly; without resistance.\n\nEven more frightening?\n\nIt's already begun.\n\n\n#UFOs #Conspiracy #Aliens\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\njengen13 (Mrs. Why Files)\nHecklefish\nDaniel Van Auken\nVictoria Young\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBGood\nCricket\nBrett\nWingedSpider\nKotenuki\nPaul Rohrbaugh\nJschoop\nThe Darkness\nRichard Bramlett\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nGene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind \"Star Trek\" by Joel Engel \nhttps://amzn.to/3S9S7rB\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Serge_Monast\n\nhttps://educate-yourself.org/cn/projectbluebeam25jul05.shtml\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/mind-reading-and-mind-control-technologies-are-coming/\n\nhttps://neuralink.com/\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Star_Trek:_The_God_Thing\n\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Devil%27s_Due_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

farmland in Elberton, Georgia. The explosion destroyed a large monument that had stood on the property for over 40 years.\n\nKnown as \"The Georgia Guidestones\", it was four monolithic slabs of granite, weighing over 230,000 pounds, that contained a set of rules for a more peaceful and orderly society. \n\nThe identity of the builder was a mystery for 40 years, but today I'll tell you who he was. \n\nBut why did he want to keep his identity a secret?

a well-known engineer released a book with information that could impact everyone on earth. But before anyone could read it, it was classified by the CIA.\n\nWe only learned of its existence a few years ago because of a Freedom of Information request.\n\nThe CIA only released 57 pages of the original 284-page manuscript. And those pages have been, in the CIA's own words, \"sanitized\".\n\nWhy does the CIA think this book is so dangerous that they had to hide it from the public for 60 years; and continue to hide most of it?\n\nIt's because the man who wrote it describes the end of the world.\n\n#CIA #Conspiracy #EndOfTheWorld\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\nDaniel_Van_Auken\njengen13\npratty505\nVictoriaY\nJschoop\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBeGood\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nThe Adam And Eve Story The History Of Cataclysms Uncensored by Chan Thomas\nhttps://amzn.to/3WbeRYJ\n\nEarth's Shifting Crust by Charles H.

New York City. Janet Kimball was driving over the Brooklyn Bridge when her car stalled and slowly rolled to a stop.\n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to get the car started, Janet was hit by a bright light. Bright enough that she had to shield her eyes. \n\nThe light was coming from an apartment building. Janet thought maybe someone was shooting a movie. Not unusual in New York City. \n\nThen she saw that the light was coming from a saucer-shaped craft hovering *above* the building. OK, it's a science fiction movie, Janet thought.\n\nBut it wasn't a movie. This was happening for real.\n\nAs Janet's eyes adjusted to the brightness, she saw something levitating in the light. Objects floating up to the saucer.\n\nWhen she focused, she realized they weren't objects. They were people.\n\nWell, one of them was.\n\nIn an instant, the light went out, and the saucer plunged into the East River.\n\nThere were 23 eyewitnesses to this event, including one of the highest-ranking politicians in the world.\n\nAnd people being transported to a UFO by a beam of light in the middle of New York City? That isn't the weirdest part of the story. \n\n#UFO #Aliens\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\nDaniel_Van_Auken\njengen13\npratty505\nVictoriaY\nJschoop\nZanythos\nLoolykins\nJohnnyBeGood\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nWitnessed; The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions, by Budd Hopkins\nhttps://amzn.to/3YY4Roh\n\n(Or read online for free: https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671569150)\n\nA Critique of Budd Hopkins' Case of the UFO Abduction of Linda Napolitano\nhttps://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/LindaCortileCase.htm\n\nNighteyes by Garfield Reeves-Stevens\nhttps://amzn.to/3InivLB\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF?

What do they want?","description":"Shadow People and The Hat Man | Who are they? What do they want?\n\nHere's how it happens.\n\nYou're drifting off to sleep; or maybe you wake up in the middle of the night. You feel a presence in the room.\n\nYou see something out of the corner of your eye. You try to look but you can't move. You try to call out, but you're unable to make a sound. There's an invisible weight on your chest. Even breathing is difficult.\n\nYou strain to look and then you see it. The shadow of a person. You can't detect any features but every instinct you have tells you: this is entity is not friendly.\n\nYou hear a light hum, maybe a rush of air and the dark entity vanishes.\n\nYou've just encountered a shadow person. \n\nThis one was pretty benign, but there are some shadow people sightings that are more intense. More real. These encounters can be traumatic and in some cases: violent.\n\nI should know.

It would take another 11 years for Congress to designate the Grand Canyon a national park.\n\nSensing a final opportunity for adventure, explorer G.E. Kincaid took a boat down the Colorado River and through the Grand Canyon. The canyon was rich in minerals like gold, silver and copper and Kincaid wanted to see what he could find before the area was closed off for good.\n\nAbout 40 miles up-river from the El Tovar Crystal canyon, Kincaid saw stains in the sediment formation about 2,000 feet up. He tied off the boat and got out to investigate.\n\nKincaid couldn't find a trail, but after a short hike he found something interesting covered in desert brush. Steps. Hundreds of them. Carved in sandstone. Steps that wound their way up to a high shelf on the side of the canyon.\n\nHe followed the steps until he came across a cavern entrance. An entrance that was clearly man made.\n\nKincaid entered the cavern and turned on his flashlight.\n\nOn the walls he saw writing. But it wasn't English or Native American writing. It was Ancient Egyptian Heiroglypics.\n\nKincaid lifted his flashlight and saw that the tunnel ran far into the distance.\n\nHe didn't realize it at the time, but this was only the beginning.\n\n#Ancient #Unsolved #Mystery\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\nDaniel_Van_Auken\njengen13\npratty505\nVictoriaY\nJschoop\nZanythos\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nThe Leak Project: https://leakproject.com/\n\nJerry and Kathy Wills Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Xpeditions\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCYMAs4cqRU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCYMAs4cqRU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCYMAs4cqRU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCYMAs4cqRU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCYMAs4cqRU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":106,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZCYMAs4cqRU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"_J5Vl3DAGKN0rBJN8AXGnfLLkAo","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLjNZYXhJZFRlOElj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-09T07:21:40Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"AFTER FILES Q&A","description":"AFTER FILES Q&A","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YaxIdTe8Ic/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YaxIdTe8Ic/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YaxIdTe8Ic/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YaxIdTe8Ic/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YaxIdTe8Ic/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":107,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3YaxIdTe8Ic"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"F175NpEx7j5C7ZQxS7HbByh481A","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLnlVRlluVlhiTG9Z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-09T02:00:09Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"How to Build a Working UFO | Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs)","description":"The US Military's Secret Flying Saucer Project | Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs)\n\nIn 1988, aerospace designer Brad Sorenson went to Norton Air Force base for the annual air show.

You'll be gone for at least ten years. And when you return to Earth, all evidence of your existence will be erased. You have to start a new life, with a new identity; forbidden to tell anyone about what you experienced.\n\nNow would you do it?\n\nIn 1965, 12 astronauts were sent to an alien planet as part of a human-alien exchange program. 13 years later the astronauts returned home. \n\nWell, most of them did.\n\nThe mission commander wrote a 3,000-page report of everything his team experienced.

But, nothing looks out of place.\n\nFinally, you go into the living room and you see it.\n\nIn your mom's favorite chair, is a pile of smoldering ash. Completely unrecognizable as human.\n\nJust as you convince yourself that this isn't your mother, you see her jewelry in the gray dust.\n\nAnd then the grisly sight of your mother's feet, still in their slippers, on the floor by the ashes.\n\nThere was a fire. An intense fire. But aside from her chair, nothing is burned. Even stranger, everything in the house is covered with a thin layer of pale yellow grease.\n\nYour mother was a victim of spontaneous human combustion.

And more sinister.\n\nIf Area 51 is the place where humans experiment on aliens; Dulce is the place where aliens experiment on us.\n\n\n#UFOs #Conspiracy #Aliens\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:\nGino Gentile\nJennifer Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nPatreon Members\n\nTHANK YOU MODS:\nDaniel_Van_Auken\njengen13\npratty505\nVictoriaY\nJschoop\nZanythos\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nBentwaters-Lakenheath UFO report:\nhttps://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81R00560R000100010010-0.pdf\n\nFBI Mutilations report:\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/Animal%20Mutilation/Animal%20Mutilation%20Part%205%20of%205\n\nKirtland AFB Sightings:\nhttps://www.unexplainable.net/ufo-alien/1980-kirtland-afb-nm-ufo-sightings-foia-documents.php\n\nPhil Schneider Preparedness Expo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTTYd6JwQ90\n\nDulce Base The Truth and Evidence from the Case Files of Gabe Valdez:\nhttps://amzn.to/3DylYVb\n\nThe Airforce UFO Cover Up That Drove a Man INSANE | They're LYING to US:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQ_FsmU19g\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/3930946/oscar-schneider\n\nPhil final lecture:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeu3-9DoUnk\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20080723164059/https://exopolitics.org/Dulce-Report.htm\n\nThomas Castello Interview:\nhttps://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/branton/esp_dulcebook11.htm\n\nCastello speaks out:\nhttps://www.alienhub.com/threads/a-terminally-ill-thomas-edwin-castello-speaks-out.21550/\n\nSaucers, Spooks and Kooks: UFO Disinformation in the Age of Aquarius:\nhttps://amzn.to/3UezW3B\n\nJohn Lear on the UFO Coverup:\nhttps://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/coverup.htm\n\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH üëΩ\nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order) üëΩ\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD üí¨ \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord üí¨ \n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION üéß\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast üéß\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n‚ñ™TWF ON THE WEBS\n‚ñ™https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚ñ™https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚ñ™https://www.rumble.com/thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://thewhyfiles.locals.com\n‚ñ™https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚ñ™https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Je3Qu-xMuxM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Je3Qu-xMuxM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Je3Qu-xMuxM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Je3Qu-xMuxM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Je3Qu-xMuxM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":115,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Je3Qu-xMuxM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WVEaBUL5DiaDnHa_3uSoRjOR9ZE","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLlEwX2x0ZzVJWWdv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-28T02:58:45Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"AFTER FILES: The Bible Code","description":"Every Event is Secretly Encoded in the Bible even YOUR Birthday (and the Apocalypse)\r\n\r\nIn September 1994, Yitzak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel received an ominous message.

With the right weather conditions, it just might be.\n\nIn 1935, RAF Air Marshall Robert Goddard was sent to examine an abandoned Scottish airbase called Drem. When he reached the base, it was in bad shape. Cows were grazing on grass growing through cracks in the tarmac.\n\nLater that day, he flew into a heavy storm and decided to head back to Drem to get his bearings. When he got close to the airfield, the rain stopped and the sun came out. When he looked down; the tarmac was brand new. Mechanics in blue uniforms were working on bright yellow planes. But RAF planes were silver, and their mechanics wore tan.\n\nLater that year, the RAF changed the color ofn their planes from silver to bright yellow -- and mechanics overalls were changed from tan to blue. \n\nOh, and in 1939, Drem was rebuilt. \n\nGoddard wasn‚Äôt a kook.

His neighbors used it too. Garbage, broken appliances, old tires, everything went in the hole.\n\nAfter a while, Mel started to wonder: why doesn't it fill up? Then he started to notice other strange things about the hole. His dogs wouldn't go near it. It caused his radio picked up strange signals.

The door of the craft slowly opened. The officers drew their guns, not sure what to expect.\n\nTo their surprise, out walked a normal-looking guy. He smiled at the stunned officers and actually waved hello.\n\nBefore the policemen could say a word, the stranger said, in clear English: \"I need to see the president.\"\n\nNine months after this event, NASA was founded.\n\nThis is the story of what happened in-between.

They spoke only gibberish, wore strange clothing and had bright green skin. When the children finally learned to speak English, they described where they were from. And that's why, after almost 1,000 years, people still talk about The Green Children of Woolpit.\n\nIn 1828, a teenage boy was shuffling through a public square in Nuremburg. He seemed confused and disoriented. He had trouble walking and speaking. When police finally approached him, he was holding an envelope containing two letters. And those letters sparked the mystery of Kaspar Hauser.\n\nIn April 1922, in Brittany, France, 2-year-old Pauline Picard went missing. A massive search turned up nothing. The family was losing hope.\n\nA month later, Pauline was found wandering around a village over 200 miles away. Though her parents were overjoyed to have her back, they soon realized something wasn't quite right with their daughter.\n\nThese are three unsolved cases of the most mysterious children in history.\n\n\n„Ä∞\n\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n----\nSOURCES & LINKS\n\nhttps://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Backrooms_Wiki\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1522960/Anemoiapolis_Chapter_1/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KANEpixels\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/\nhttp://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/start\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@unicosobreviviente\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em53XAY_xR4\nhttps://twitter.com/SpaceLiminalBot\n\n--\n\nThank you Patrons!\n\nJim H\nDaniel M\nMauricio CT\nEW Coffey\nB Hendley\nStella R\nDalton R\nJ Gasper\nAaron C\nJacob S\nChristy & Erik A\nSteve Spencer\nKalmar\nPatrick I\nMikey2ky\nLaura G\nAll CA Reptile Girl\nUncle Mike\nB Ness\nRobin Lotz - Black Belt!\nGrace Cupcake\nLost Pilot\nMiketpi\nAaron K\nManumelita N\nPaul W\nBrains Ironically\nRyan V\nDizzle McShizzle\nGeorge D\ndsciobanu.com\nFran O\nIka H\nAlyson W\nJL Palacios\nDavid F\nKyle P\nVT Young\nK Dabney\nUniverse C-137\nKenny S\nMarie D\nE Pluck\nJanna P!\nRosemarie G\nHaiji\nKaren B\nJ Meeks\ndogamma\npeppermint butler\nM Mann\nA Mei\nS Toornburg\nNoxheart\nSarah W\nD Arenz\nE Engberg\nM Considine\nD Dessaur\nJ Peters\nMark R\nD Weaver\nT Petty\nM Vargas\nVonn\nC Pittaway\nKevin USA\nP Carone\nCris C\nSoly Kos\nRoyanne L\nSentei\nNA Preator\nDani C\nD Morrow\nGabriel M\nArin R\nJ Brown\nLaini M\nJarrod H\nS Forrestier\nC Sierra\nIngi J\nWendy K\nJ Usas\nJ Daniels\nP Anderson\nP Rohrbaugh\nJ Baker\nDuke Nicebury\nJohnny O\nC Corrie\nJovan S\nM Scheff\nKasey\nJ Reynlods\nJ Dutan\nW York\n\nY'all are the best!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svUGFt3AF4w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svUGFt3AF4w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svUGFt3AF4w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svUGFt3AF4w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svUGFt3AF4w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":136,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"svUGFt3AF4w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"amuyVsI_-HpJDLp78i6l436iyrw","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLngzNmJvTzZoV2pN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-11T13:00:12Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"An Empty World, A Time Traveler, Another Dimension | Liminal Spaces: The Reality In-between","description":"In the past year or so, three internet mysteries popped up that really got my attention.

Your favorite coffee mug is there, but it has a crack you don't remember. You could have sworn your coffee maker was black, but this one is chrome.\n\nJust as you think you're going crazy, you feel a strange tingling sensation; and hear a buzzing in your ears. A flash of light; the buzzing stops, and you feel dizzy.\n\nAs you regain your balance, you look around. Everything seems back to normal. The coffee maker *is* black, your mug is *not* cracked.\n\nWhat was that? A dream, your imagination? It seemed so real. Are you just overtired? Are you going crazy?\n\nOr maybe, you somehow slipped through the multiverse. For a brief moment, you switched lives with yourself in an alternate reality.\n\nThere are documented cases of this happening to people all over the world. Usually, the differences between realities are small. But every once in a while, the changes are so different, that you're another person entirely.\n\nThis happened to a man traveling through a Tokyo airport.

That leaves 1% of the stinky stuff, hydrogen sulfide. Yeah, hydrogen sulfide is -- pretty rank.\n\nMost people fart about 20 times a day. If someone tells you they don't fart, they're lying. Question everything they say.\n\nFarts are fast. They zoom out at about 3 meters per second, or 7 miles per hour.\n\nFarts are warm. You know how you can see your breath when it's cold? Yeah, same thing happens down there.\n\nWomen's farts smell worse than men's. Although women and men produce the same amount of flatulence, studies show that women's farts consistently contain higher concentrations of hydrogen sulfide ‚Äî the stinky stuff.\n\nThe animal that farts so much it affects the atmosphere? Termites. Yep, about 2% of global methane emissions come from termites.\n\nFarts can explode. Who doesn't love a tiktok of someone lighting their farts on fire? Turns out, your farts really ARE flammable.  Two chemicals in farts, methane and hydrogen, are highly flammable, which is what makes it possible to create a small explosion if you hold a lighter up to your cheeks. Don't do that though. It doesn't matter how many views you get. It's not worth it.\n\nCertain foods make your farts smell worse. Sulfur rich foods like eggs and meat, break down and create hydrogen sulfide, which is the stinky stuff.\n\nThe oldest joke in history is actually a fart joke. It's an ancient Sumerian proverb from 1900 BC that says, \"Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap.\"\n\nVegetarians fart more than meat eaters. That's because of the beans. You know, the musical fruit? Beans contain carbohydrates made of molecules that are too large to be absorbed in our small intestine during digestion. So they skip the line and pass into the large intestine still intact. This leads to an increase in bacteria, which produces large amounts of hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide gas.\n\nNext time a vegan brags to you about not eating meat. Just tell them, \"I know. I can smell you.\"\n\nYour butt can tell the difference between a fart and poop. The nerve endings in your rectum know if it needs to release air or -- stool. The only exception is when you have the runs. Liquid poop confuses the nerve endings. So, be careful when you squeeze.\n\nHolding in farts isn't harmful. You're not going to explode or anything or get sick. But sooner or later, that air's coming out. Probably when you're asleep and your spouse - is awake.\n\nFarting isn't gross. It's something a healthy human body does.\n\nSo, next time you feel that pressure, don't be shy. Turn to the person nearest and dearest to you and say: \"Hey honey, pull my finger.\"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RFB3MibNEGs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RFB3MibNEGs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RFB3MibNEGs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RFB3MibNEGs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RFB3MibNEGs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":166,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RFB3MibNEGs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"MP0JpChvayz6fS0dVfLozonZ7Ww","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLlN1N1AyazVRLUFZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-13T13:00:11Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Crazy Coincidences 03 - The Why Files #shorts","description":"Crazy Coincidences 03 #shorts\n\nThese things happened.\n\nIn the year 2000, the Simpsons predicted that Donald Trump would become president. 16 years later, this prediction became true.

The last soldier killed was George Edwin Ellison. Though 40 million people died during the war, these two soldiers are buried in the same cemetery, 15 feet apart.\n\nThe Devil Flight! Finnair flight 666 departed from Copenhagen and landed in Helsinki (known by shortcode HEL). The day of the flight was Friday the 13th.

Suddenly, a flash of intense white light burst from the sun's surface.\n\nHe had become the first eye-witness of a major Coronal Mass Ejection or CME. And it was headed straight for earth.\n\nSeventeen hours later, the night sky in North America lit up like the day. Aurora Borealis, typically only seen near the north pole, were visible as far south as Colombia. In the southern hemisphere, Aurora Australis were visible North of Brisbane.\n\nA few hours later, on September 2, the most powerful solar storm ever recorded crashed into the Earth's atmosphere. Our magnetic field was immediately overpowered and created chaos around the world.\n\nNobody had ever seen anything like this before.

Both were right feet, both were size 12.\n\nOver the next few years, more and more feet started showing up. Including a few in pairs, and almost always with their shoes still on.\n\nSome claimed there was a serial killer on the loose. It was a complete mystery why feet would suddenly start just... appearing.\n\nTurns out, the explanation is simple. A change in footwear design.\n\nWhen a body sinks to the bottom of the sea, it's quickly set upon by scavengers; that prefer soft body parts because they're easier to handle than bones.\n\nOn humans, our ankles are soft. They're really just ligaments and soft tissue. Once this tissue is chewed away, the foot easily detaches.\n\nAs for why we didn't see feet washing up until 2007 is because of modern sneaker design. The past 20 years or so, sneakers have been made of light foam and the soles have air pockets.\n\nWhen the foot comes off, the sneaker acts as a balloon and brings the foot to the surface. And thanks to sneaker buoyancy, over 15 missing persons cases have now been closed.\n\n----\nSUPPORT THE WHY FILES\nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles\n\n----\nOFFICIAL\nhttps://thewhyfiles.com\n\n----\nSOCIAL\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/thewhyfiles\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\nDiscord: https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n----\nCHECK OUT HECKLEFISH'S CHANNEL\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06-Sdo1Qkqk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06-Sdo1Qkqk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06-Sdo1Qkqk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06-Sdo1Qkqk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06-Sdo1Qkqk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":184,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"06-Sdo1Qkqk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"x-04jX5SUNPqSfssHRBhxbGWBG8","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLnpNRlRMZHFGVXdR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-03-03T15:00:36Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Computer Predicts the End of the World | But here's what they DON'T tell you","description":"COMPUTER PREDICTS WORLD WILL END IN 2040\n\nIn 1704, using a series of calculations, Isaac Newton predicted the world would end sometime around the year 2060.\n\nAlmost 300 years later, in 1973, a computer at MIT made the prediction that life as we know it will end around the year 2040.\n\nIt also predicted that some of the first signs would be seen in the year 2020.\n\nSome of its predictions have come true and scientists are taking this seriously.\n\nBut can we trust the study?

Dying of tuberculosis, he wanted to return home to Switzerland. Before he left, he gave hundreds of pages of handwritten notes to his favorite language student Georgios Papachatzis. \n\nDienach thought translating his notes would help Papachatzis in his study of the German language. They said goodbye and never saw each other again.\n\nPapahatzis began translating the pages. There were whole passages about a coming nuclear war, colonizing Mars, and a global government. Sections about flying vehicles, holographic technology, and contact with alien life. Papchatzis thought it was a science fiction novel. \n\nBut as more and more of the text was revealed, Papahatzis was shocked at what he discovered. This wasn't a novel at all. This was actually Dienach's personal diary. Dienach wrote about how he went into a coma and woke up 2000 years in the future.\n\nIt seems that Paul Amadeus Dienach had experienced some kind of time slip that caused him to fall asleep in the year 1921, and wake up in the year 3906.\n\nHe spent a *whole year* in the future.

WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT DYATLOV PASS?\n\nWhen the helicopter rescue team arrived at the Dyatlov Pass in February 1959, the nine missing hikers had been dead for weeks.\n\nThe more the investigators tried to piece together what happened, the more the story didn't seem to add up.\n\nTheir tent had been cut open from the inside and abandoned, but there was no sign of a struggle.\n\nOver a half-mile away, two victims were almost completely naked. Though temperatures were 30 below zero that night. Other bodies were found even farther away.\n\nTwo had fractured skulls, two more had major chest injuries, one was missing his eyes; another was missing her tongue. And reports show that two of the hikers had been exposed to unusually high amounts of radiation.\n\nSoviet investigators listed the cause of death as \"a compelling natural force,\" and closed the case a few weeks later.\n\nThe Dyatlov Pass Incident has been a mystery for over 60 years. Theories include a military cover-up, a KGB operation gone wrong, a bigfoot attack and of course -- aliens.\n\nOne researcher believes he knows what happened that night.\n\nOthers are not so sure.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n#unsolvedmysteries #dyatlovpass #paranormal","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSZ9wPPcszo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSZ9wPPcszo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSZ9wPPcszo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSZ9wPPcszo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSZ9wPPcszo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":190,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TSZ9wPPcszo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"SUO4m8ma8ndm4ESoW_He9_5erQM","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLmxMWnlSQTdvTGlr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-22T22:12:10Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Did you feel the earth move?","description":"On April 19, 2010, a Muslim cleric in Iran blamed earthquakes on women who dressed - immodestly.\n\nJen McCreight was a student at Purdue University when she heard this.

It's scientifically sound, there's a waiting list to participate, and the procedure -- is one hundred percent fatal.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n#science #future #technology","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqM-rhKniLE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqM-rhKniLE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqM-rhKniLE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqM-rhKniLE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqM-rhKniLE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":195,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TqM-rhKniLE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"YvPlO1KkEx3zi-ymrP7ZkMnAilU","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLmJBVU4xR0pENUJR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-09-01T14:00:12Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"How Long Can Humans Live Without Their Head?

On one side of the sleeve is a geometric pattern. On the other side, the words \"Absolute Discretion\".\n\nInside is a security card. Printed with a website and a code.

But why does this 500 foot tall, 29-story building have no windows, no lights and no markings at all?\n\nBecause it's a top-secret NSA spy station built to withstand nuclear war.\n\nOfficially, this is an AT&T telecommunications building. But thanks to leaked documents, we now know that 33 Thomas Street is actually a top secret NSA mass surveillance hub.\n\nIt's code name is: TitanPointe. And right now, as we speak, TitanPointe is listening.\n\nThe gray, granite tower is located at 33 Thomas Street in Lower Manhattan. Locals know the building as the \"Long Lines Building\" and it's been a source of mystery for years. What jumps out is that the building has no windows and no exterior lighting. During the day, it fades into the background of the New York City skyline. And at night, it becomes an invisible shadow.\n\nThanks to NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden, we now know that creating an invisible building wasn't an accident. It was absolutely by design.\n\n33 Thomas Street operates under NSA codename TITANPOINTE. And Titanpointe is a core location used for a controversial, and possibly illegal, NSA-sponsored mass surveillance program.

We have no idea what an alien civilization would look like. Humans are evolved primates. What if an alien species is reptilian? Or more like an insect? Or a hybrid of these? Or maybe something completely unique that we couldn't even imagine.\n\nThere is only one set of universal laws that every species must follow. Physics. Specifically energy.\n\nOne way to measure a civilization is by its energy consumption. This is done with the Kardashev Scale.\n\nBy using the Kardashev Scale, we can address some big questions about alien civilizations. Like: Fermi's Paradox. It's estimated that there are 40 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way that could support life. Certainly a few of these should have given rise to intelligent life. And if so, where is everyone?\n\nA recent study done by researchers at JPL and CalTech states that when a civilization finally reaches a certain point on the Kardashev Scale, it destroys itself. Which is why we haven't discovered any evidence. They're gone.\n\nAnd the Kardashev Scale addresses the most worrisome theory of all.

It's one of the most recognizable, and most visited landmarks in America. But Mount Rushmore has a secret.\n\nThe sculpture, which famously depicts four former US Presidents as 60 foot granite faces, was constructed between 1927 and 1941 under the direction of architect Gutzon Borglum.\n\nEverybody knows that.\n\nBut few people know about the secret project Borglum was working on as part of the monument.\n\nOver the next 16 years, Borglum wrestled with the federal government about funding and control of Mount Rushmore - which he never technically completed.\n\nBorglum wanted to carve the presidents down to their waists and chisel a description of the memorial next to them. But when it became clear there wasn't enough space for an inscription, he came up with a new idea.\n\nHe envisioned a grand hall measuring 80‚Ä≤ tall x 100‚Ä≤ long, accessible via an 800-foot granite staircase, that would include busts of famous Americans, as well as bronze and glass cabinets containing historical documents like the Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence. A massive bronze eagle with a 38-foot wingspan would be mounted above the entrance, with the inscription reading The Hall of Records above the door. Borglum believed that future generations might find Mount Rushmore as much a mystery as Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Egypt. So he wanted to come up with a way to preserve its history and make sure the story behind the carving would never be forgotten. \n\nThe vault was to be built just behind Abraham Lincoln's hairline and would contain all the information anyone would ever need about the mountain. \n\nEventually funding had run out and the project was declared finished on October 31, 1941\n\nFinally, in 1998, officials agreed to a scaled-back version of the idea. Today, sculpted into a series of porcelain enamel panels, is the story and history of Mount Rushmore; along with an explanation of why Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln were chosen. \n\nThere are also panels sculpted with the text of the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Gettysburg Address. Park officials even included a biography of Borglum. They're all kept inside a titanium vault behind a giant, 1,200-pound granite slab.\n\nNow, even high-ranking officials are banned from seeing this hidden, and largely unknown, chamber. But its true intent was to serve as a historical record for future civilizations, so we can imagine that Borglum would be pleased to know his project was finally completed - and may one day do exactly as he intended.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n#mystery #secrets #history","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hckQ0TZ1h4w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hckQ0TZ1h4w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hckQ0TZ1h4w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hckQ0TZ1h4w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hckQ0TZ1h4w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":208,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hckQ0TZ1h4w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2ytmv0urMWH-jMwzm6dAWe88Glg","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLkpTd1QzdldhekZv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-25T16:00:06Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"The Science of Ancient Acoustic Levitation | How The Pyramids Were Built?","description":"LEVITATION. The ruins of several ancient civilizations - like the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge in the UK, and many others - are monuments constructed of massive stones. How the great pyramids of Egypt were built has been the subject of debate for a long time.\n\nThe fact is, no one really knows for certain exactly how some of these megaliths were constructed. Some researchers think ancient cultures may have mastered levitation through sound which allowed them to easily manipulate massive objects. Unfortunately, anyone suggesting the use of this kind of technology is attacked and labeled a \"pseudoscientist\".\n\nAbul Hasan Ali Al-Masudi is known as the Herodotus of the Arabs. Like everyone, he was awestruck by the pyramids. He wrote a very intriguing passage about how the giant stone blocks were transported -- through levitation.\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza does possess some extraordinary acoustic properties, and can dramatically amplify sounds at certain frequencies. The Egyptians clearly knew a lot about sound science. \n\nLet's explore the Coral Castle in Florida, built by Edward Leedskalnin, who cut, transported and sculpted over 1,000 tons of rock into a sprawling complex -- alone, without heavy machinery.\n\nWe'll visit The Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek in Lebanon which boasts the largest stones ever carved by human hands. \n\nNan Madol is an archaeological site in Micronesia. It's been called the Machu Picchu of the Pacific. The engineering of Nan Madol is so complex, no one can figure out how it was built.\n\nLet's hear the story told by Dr. Jarl about Tibetan monks who lifted stones by chanting and playing instruments -- which Jarl put on film.\n\nThere is science behind all these stories, yet \"mainstream\" academia dismisses each and every one as pseudoscience. Why is it wrong to want to explore ancient knowledge that contradicts modern beliefs? Isn't this the exact purpose of science?\n\nI think so. Let's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n----\nFURTHER READING\nhttps://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/antigravityworldgrid/ciencia_antigravityworldgrid08.htm\n\n#science #mystery #ancienthistory","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSwT3vWazFo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSwT3vWazFo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSwT3vWazFo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSwT3vWazFo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSwT3vWazFo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":209,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"JSwT3vWazFo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"pSc8KSDQpf2AZvlTcEuxt2jOOiY","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLnFQLU52cUhCZnJr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-23T21:03:33Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Message To The Misfits, Outcasts, Dreamers & Visionaries","description":"Any challenge of established scientific dogma is labeled pseudoscience. Isn't that a bit arrogant? Isn't pseudoscience only pseudoscience until it's actual... science?\n\nBut people are afraid to go up against the establishment.\n\nKepler and Copernicus were ridiculed by their peers. Louis Pasteur's research was rejected by the medical establishment. Gregor Mendel. Nikola Tesla. Initially, they were rejected. Imagine the hate they'd get if Twitter existed?\n\nIn 1903 when the Wright Brothers and others were building airplanes, the New York Times said manned flight would not be possible for 1 to 10 *million* years. \n\nIn 1985, the New York Times said no matter how inexpensive or powerful a laptop computer would become, nobody would want one.\n\nWhen Apple announced the iPhone, the Times said they'd probably never build it and even if they did, nobody would buy it.\n\nSpeaking of Twitter, here's what the Times said when it launched:\n\n\"Using Twitter for literate communication is about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite ‚ÄòThe Iliad.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Whether the service can be made into a sustainable business, quite unknown. I‚Äôm skeptical.\"\n\nIf you suggest any idea that goes against the mainstream, you're viciously attacked. Not just by Facebook and Twitter, but by the New York Freakin Times!\n\nAren't new ideas worth exploring? Did Steve Jobs care what people thought about him? Does Elon Musk care? No. They just went out and changed the world.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said: \"All great truths begin as blasphemies.\"\n\nThis message is to those blasphemers. \n\nTo the misfits and dreamers and visionaries. My message is to you: they are going to attack you. They are going to hate you. Ignore them. Keep dreaming. Keep building. Keep blaspheming.\n\nBecause I can tell you with 100% certainty the world needs you - much more - than it needs the New York Times.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n#thewhyfiles #misfits #dreamers #thankyou","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qP-NvqHBfrk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qP-NvqHBfrk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qP-NvqHBfrk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qP-NvqHBfrk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qP-NvqHBfrk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":210,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qP-NvqHBfrk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"IMJyenRpD0eIX5QO9cJbccvd_TA","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLkNMQVRVdVZjUEJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-11T16:00:03Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Earthquakes Asteroids Zombies: Predictions of Nostradamus","description":"NOSTRADAMUS. 2022 Predictions: Earthquakes, Asteroids & Zombies? If you believe the predictions of Nostradamus and you enjoyed 2020, you're gonna *love* 2021.\n\nWhile many astrologers, seers and mystics are predicting a hopeful future. If you believe Nostradamus, you better start kissing your mommies and saying your goodbyes.\n\nHe predicted that 2020 would be a \"great trouble for humanity\". Well, that was true. And he says a greater trouble is coming in the form of a global famine. According to Nostradamus, the famine will be the worst the world has ever faced and will ultimately end in a disruption of social hierarchies and state power.\n\nNostradamus predicted solar storms will take place. He said: \"We shall see the water rising and the earth falling under it\". \n\nThen he predicts a comet or asteroid will hit the earth or come very close to striking the planet which will cause earthquakes and other natural disasters: \"In the sky, one sees fire and a long trail of sparks.\"\n\nFYI, we did have a few close calls with asteroids this past year. And NASA's automated asteroid watching system -- called Sentry -- is currently tracking asteroid 2009 JF1. JF1 is around 130 meters in diameter. About the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. This could hit Earth in 2022.\n\nNostradamus predicted a great calamity would shake through the New World in the \"Lands of the West\" causing it to fall into the ocean. This is thought to be California. He suggested that this great calamity will happen when \"Mercury in Sagittarius, Saturn fading\". The date when Mars and Saturn will be in those exact positions in the sky is Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 2021.\n\nAnd the last prediction is a doozie.

Time travel *to the future* is not only possible, it's been scientifically proven.\n\nBut what about traveling to the past? Well, that's a little trickier.\n\nBUT, there does seem to be evidence that travelers from the future have visited us in the past; and may be among us right now.\n\nThe human race has been fascinated with traveling through time ever since, well, ever since the human race understood what time was.\n\nBut has time travel been achieved by future humans? And if so, did they leave us clues that they were here?\n\nWe've scoured the internet for the best time travel stories we could find. You may know some of them. Some are hoaxes. A few have been debunked. But there are a couple of stories that defy explanation.\n\nWhy are we so obsessed with time travel? Probably because we're obsessed with time. Time rules our lives. \n\nWho doesn't wish they could go back and talk to our younger selves, or meet our ancestors, or witness historical events.\n\nTime creates possibilities; but time also *ends* possibilities. It's finite. When a moment is over. It's over. There are no second chances.\n\nThe expression \"time is money\" isn't exactly true. Time is much more valuable than money. Wealth can be made; lost and made again. But time? Once we lose it, we can never get it back.\n\nTime is the most valuable thing you have.\n\nSpend it wisely.\n\n----\nCONTENTS\n00:00 - Is there evidence of time travel? YES.\n00:23 - Logo.

If hell has a sound, I bet it sounds alot like the Aztec Death Whistle. The Aztec Death Whistle sounds like a shriek of death mixed with howling wind. It's so unnerving, that the significance of the horrifying sound of the Aztec Death Whistle has fascinated and perplexed scholars for years.\n\nI'm going to play the sound of the Aztec Death Whistle for you today.\n\nWhen Spanish conquistador Cort√©s and his men arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl√°n in 1521, they described witnessing a gruesome ceremony. Aztec priests, using razor-sharp obsidian blades, sliced open the chests of sacrificial victims and offered their still-beating hearts to the gods. They then tossed the victims' lifeless bodies down the steps of the Great Temple known as Templo Mayor; in Mexico City.\n\nAndr√©s de Tapia, also a conquistador, described two rounded towers flanking the Templo Mayor made entirely of human skulls. And between them, a *huge* wooden rack displaying thousands more skulls with holes bored through either side to allow them to slide onto the wooden poles.\n\nReading these accounts hundreds of years later, many historians dismissed the 16th-century reports as wildly exaggerated.\n\n*But* over just the past few years, archeologists working at the Templo Mayor excavation site discovered *proof* of widespread human sacrifice among the Aztecs. And the proof was *none other* than the very skull towers and skull racks that the conquistadors had described centuries ago.\n\nThe Aztec Death Whistle has been described as sounding like humans howling in pain, or as one researcher said, the 'scream of a thousand corpses'.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n----\nCONTENTS\n00:00 - What does the Aztec Death Whistle sound like?\n00:27 - Logo\n00:31 - Aztec ceremonies\n01:24 - Towers of skulls\n01:54 - Proof of human sacrifice discovered\n02:18 - Human sacrifice as part of Aztec religion\n03:09 - Sacrifice was common around the world\n04:27 - The Death Whistle sound\n05:49 - Intimidating enemies\n06:22 - What is the whistle?\n07:06 - Sound analysis\n07:51 - Hecklefish tries a Death Whistle\n08:13 - Other resonators discovered\n08:38 - Curing illness with sound\n09:14 - Vibroacoustic Sound Therapy\n09:30 - Ancients cultures were like us\n09:58 - Thanks for watching!\n\n\n----\nBuy a whistle:\nhttps://amzn.to/3uDRds5\nhttps://amzn.to/3LmOwl8\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n\n#science  #mystery  #history","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5szkAecabU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5szkAecabU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5szkAecabU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5szkAecabU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5szkAecabU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":215,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Y5szkAecabU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"LMZg9xfX3ls1UcplXmJgT7xF8mA","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLlROS1p6LUMwRU9j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-04T20:10:56Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"The Philadelphia Experiment - The truth about invisibility, teleportation and time travel","description":"The Philadelphia Experiment. It was October 1943. The day the US Navy mastered time travel, teleportation, and invisibility. Actually, they didn't master anything. The experiment had disastrous consequences for the crew of the USS Eldridge.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, two years after the US entered World War II, American destroyers were being decimated by the infamous German U-boat submarines and German mines were making combat... and commerce dangerous enterprises.\n\nThe United States Navy knew something had to be done.\n\nA few months later, on October 28th, 1943, the USS Eldridge, a Cannon-class destroyer, was docked in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. And the Eldridge held some secrets.\n\nIt was a newly commissioned vessel that was equipped with several large generators as part of a top-secret mission to win the Battle of the Atlantic once and for all.\n\nRumor aboard the ship was that the generators were designed to power a new kind of magnetic field that would make the warship invisible to enemy radar and undetectable to enemy mines.\n\nWith the full crew on board, it was time to test the system. In broad daylight, and in plain sight of nearby ships, the switches were thrown on the powerful generators, which hummed to life.\n\nWhat happened next was unexpected. And it would baffle scientists and fuel decades of speculation. Witnesses described a murky green fog that surrounded the entire hull of the ship; and then swallowed it whole.\n \nWhen the fog faded away seconds later, the USS Eldridge... was gone. It wasn't just invisible to military radar. It was invisible to everyone. It was gone...\n\nThat is, until it mysteriously turned up in Norfolk, Virginia. That's a distance of about 250 miles. \n\nAnd the strangest part? When it arrived in Norfolk ‚Äì it was ten minutes earlier in the day than when it disappeared from Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eldridge then reappeared in Philadelphia twenty minutes later. Or, uh, ten minutes later? Because of the whole, uh, time travel thing? Hard to tell. Either way, it came back. \n\nBut something had gone terribly wrong.\n\nAccording to reports, when the ship rematerialized, members of the Eldridge crew suffered from terrible burns and disorientation. And some of its crew had been fused into the metal walls at the molecular level. They were unable to move. Unable to free their skin from the metal that it clung to; and died in agony. \n\nOther crew members went insane. And some of the crew? They disappeared altogether.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n----\nCONTENTS\n00:00 - The Philadelphia Experiment\n00:18 - Logo\n00:24 - American Destroyers are being decimated by U-Boats\n00:56 - The USS Eldridge held secrets\n01:16 - The switches are thrown, generators go live\n02:07 - Something went wrong\n02:33 - Hecklefish disappears\n02:54 - People believed the story\n03:53 - What was the Navy up to?

The docs are currently being hosted at the Black Vault, a privately-run database housing declassified papers and studies. The download includes almost 3,000 pages of PDFs focused on alien spacecraft encounters and strange cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena or UAPs.\n\nThis comes after a LONG struggle with authorities to make these files available to the general public. Black Vault founder, John Greenewald Jr., spent almost 20 years continually filing suits, filing Freedom of Information Acts also known as FOIA requests, asking that the CIA disclose its UAP records. \n\nI know this will come as a shock but dealing with the CIA was... difficult. He said it was like pulling teeth; going around and around with them. Then he finally received a large box containing a couple of thousand pages. John kindly scanned every single page for us, one at a time, and released them to the public.\n\nOne of the most interesting documents seems to prove the physical evidence of a UFO. You can see this for yourself. It's document C 0 5 5 1 5 6 2 2 which is dated April 1976 and in the title is the actual words \"UFO Research\". According to the document, the CIA HAND DELIVERED an object to a researcher who was advising the government.\n\nSo what was hand delivered by agents to a scientist? We don't know yet because much of the document is redacted but lots of people are digging through the archive to try and piece this together.\n\nNow you can, too.\n\nOn the Black Vault YouTube channel, John has a video that's over an hour long where he goes into some of the more interesting documents.

This was the time of the really big dinosaur. But few measure up to what are called TITANOSAURS.\n\nTitanosaurs belonged to a group of sauropod dinosaurs which are defined by their long neck and tail, four-legs. Early in their evolution, they were about the size of dogs and omnivorous. But eventually they became herbivores and unbelievably... HUGE.\n\nNow a team of South American paleontologists have unearthed the fossilized remains of a massive 98 million-year-old titanosaur in northwest Patagonia in Argentina. This might be the largest dinosaur specimen ever found.\n\nHeaded up by researchers from several museums and universities (link below), the fossils were extracted from dense sedimentary deposits known as the Candeleros Formation.\n\nThe fossils excavated are believed to belong to be larger than that of all previously discovered mega-relatives like Patago-titan.\n\nThe Patagotitan was found in the desert near La Flecha in 2008. It lived about 100 million years ago and measured up to 37 meters (122 feet) long. \n\nAnother titanosaur, found in southwestern Argentina in 1987 was officially titled Argentinosaurus. That one grew up to 40 meters (131 feet) long and weighed more than 110 tons. That's about the weight of an adult blue whale and bigger than a 10-story building.\n\nTitanosaur remains are not unique to South America. Bones have been found on every continent except Antarctica. But this latest finding could be a world record breaker.\n\nIn order to determine a more precise measurement of this titanosaur's size, scientists still have to dig its evolutionary history. But preliminary data shows that it's most likely larger than Patagotitan Majorum and will probably break the record as the biggest animal EVER to walk the Earth.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twstdwcxjdk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twstdwcxjdk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twstdwcxjdk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twstdwcxjdk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twstdwcxjdk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":219,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"twstdwcxjdk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6_9aiRvqPPxq2a_ci9U368pX9bY","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLldNRVRCSHZvLVU0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-01-21T18:00:06Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"The Nevada Triangle | 2,000 Planes Mysteriously Crashed & Missing Near Area 51 üëΩü§î","description":"Most of us have heard of the Bermuda Triangle, where planes and ships have mysteriously gone missing in the Atlantic Ocean for decades. Did you know there is a similar place in Nevada? The Nevada Triangle. In a region of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Nevada and California, 2,000 planes have been lost in the last 60 years. In this remotely populated area of more than 25,000 miles of mountain desert, many of the crash sites have never been found.\n\nThe Nevada Triangle is typically defined as spanning from Las Vegas, Nevada in the southeast to Fresno, California in the west, and to Reno, Nevada at the top. Within this wilderness is the mysterious, top-secret Area 51. Along with the dozens of conspiracy theories which include UFOs and paranormal activity that surrounds the air force base, similar theories have long been considered regarding the Nevada Triangle.\n\nOne plane to go missing was that of a record-setting aviator, sailor, and adventurer named Steve Fossett on September 3, 2007. Fossett, flying a single-engine plane over Nevada's Great Basin Desert, took off and never returned. After hunting for a month for the plane, the search was called off and on February 15, 2008, Fossett was declared dead. Later that year on September 29th, Fossett's identification cards were discovered in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California by a hiker.\n\nThroughout the years, many of the missing planes were flown by experienced pilots and have disappeared under mysterious circumstances: and their wreckage never found.\n\nThe biggest mystery is: nobody really talks about it.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Contents of this video ---------------------\n00:00 - The Nevada Triangle | 2,000 aircraft crashed or missing\n00:35 - Logo\n00:37 - The Sierra Nevada Mountains\n00:53 - Nevada Triangle Map\n01:52 - Steve Fossett missing\n02:56 - B-24 Bomber crash\n04:06 - Bomber found in Hester Lake\n04:23 - Lt.

Even Alan Turing took a crack at it and came up short.\n\nIt's written from left to right and although it's never been \"officially\" deciphered, there's definitely a structure to it.

More specifically, nanorobotics refers to the still largely theoretical nanotechnology engineering discipline of designing and building nanorobots.\n\nThese aren't the fictional nanobots of Iron Man or Rick and Morty. A nanorobot, or nanobot, is a popular term for molecules engineered with a unique property that enables them to be programmed to carry out a specific task within the human body. Medical nanotechnology is a reality and being actively researched and developed.\n\nStructural DNA nanotechnology, known as DNA origami, has emerged as a versatile approach to fabricate nanodevices, nanomaterials and nanoparticles with complex nanoscale geometry, functionalities, and programmed mechanical and dynamic properties.\n\nNanorobotics can also revolutionize industry. Nano metamaterials are much stronger than steel -- and much lighter. They can be used for environmental clean up of the Earth's air and water, more efficiently than ever before.\n\nNanotechnology can also allow us to connect our brains directly to the internet. This is something the futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted would occur by 2030. Are you ready to wire your brain into the cloud?\n\nWith new technologies, comes new dangers.

Designers work hard to avoid the Uncanny Valley or exploit it to elicit a particular response.\n\nThe feelings of Uncanny Valley can reach extreme levels like revulsion, exceeding those experienced when viewing a corpse.

Pirates. Yes, pirates.","description":"Why doesn't the United States use the Metric System? Answer: Pirates.\n\nWhen the US was still brand new, the states were using their own systems of weights and measures. A pound in New York could weigh less than a pound in Virginia. Interstate commerce was difficult.\n\nThis was such a major problem that in 1790, President George Washington said in his first State of the Union address that ‚Äúuniformity in the currency, weights and measures of the United States is an object of great importance.‚Äù\n\nSecretary of State at the time was Thomas Jefferson who liked a new \"decimal based\" system being used in France. This \"metric system\" would make all measurements would be divisible by 10: an inch a tenth of a foot, etc. Jefferson invited French scientist Joseph Dombey to the US in 1793 to preview ‚Äúa small metallic cylinder with what looked like a handle on top. This was the official ‚Äòkilogram,‚Äô and weighed one kilogram.‚Äù This copper object was called a \"grave\".\n\nJefferson planned to use it to demonstrate the metric system to Congress, to the states, to the citizenry and, hopefully, convert the entire system of the United States to metric.\n\nDombey never made it to America.\n\nDombey‚Äôs ship hit a storm and was blown South toward the Caribbean. Who was lurking in the waters in the 18th century Caribbean? Pirates. That's who. \n\nTechnically, they were British privateers charged with harassing American shipping lanes. The swashbucklers captured Dombey and imprisoned him hoping to score a ransom. Instead, Dombey died in prison. \n\nThe official metric objects didn‚Äôt arrive, and the US moved on, instead embracing the current system: the \"United States Customary\" system which is based on the British Imperial system.\n\nTechnically and officially, America is indeed a metric country, but colloquially US Customary is still widely used in the States.\n\nLet's find out why.\n\n„Ä∞\nüôè SUPPORT THE WHY FILES \nüôè https://www.patreon.com/thewhyfiles (Fun, Free Perks!)\n\nüëΩ BUY WHY FILES MERCH \nüëΩ https://shop.thewhyfiles.com (Code: LIZZIDPEEPLE for 10% off first order)\n\nüí¨ CHAT WITH US ON DISCORD \nüí¨ https://thewhyfiles.com/discord\n\n„Ä∞\nüåê OFFICIAL WEB SITE: https://thewhyfiles.com\n\nüïµÔ∏è Submit a topic, suggestion or just say hi: \nüïµÔ∏è https://thewhyfiles.com/tips\n\nüé® Have a product suggestion or want to design artwork for TWF? \nüé® https://thewhyfiles.com/merch\n\nüì∏ BE A WHY FILES MODEL (and get free stuff!) \nüì∏ Send a photo of you/family/friends watching TWF, \nüì∏ wearing TWF gear, using TWF merchandise: \nüì∏ https://thewhyfiles.com/wild\n\n„Ä∞\nüéß THE PODCAST VERSION\nüéß https://thewhyfiles.com/podcast\n\n„Ä∞\n‚Åç TWF on SOCIAL (in order of importance)\n‚Åç https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWhyFiles/\n‚Åç https://twitter.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.instagram.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n‚Åç https://www.tiktok.com/@thewhyfiles\n‚Åç https://www.facebook.com/OMGTheWhyFiles\n\n„Ä∞\nüê† BETTER CHANNELS TO WATCH:\nüê† https://www.youtube.com/c/HecklefishMoriarty\nü§ì https://www.youtube.com/c/TheWhyFilesBackstage\n\n\n\n\n#science #history #interestingfacts","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZNEQFp9FYw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZNEQFp9FYw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZNEQFp9FYw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZNEQFp9FYw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CZNEQFp9FYw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"The Why Files","playlistId":"UUIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","position":227,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"CZNEQFp9FYw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"The Why Files","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vzBoo731Yn3NGRnub7A_3RXBYRg","id":"VVVJRmsydXZDTmNFbVo3N2cwRVNLTGNRLjE2eGhwdjEzRHNN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-11-06T02:29:34Z","channelId":"UCIFk2uvCNcEmZ77g0ESKLcQ","title":"Raining spiders, frogs, fish and ... meat.

Homer, Pliny the Elder, even the Bible document the raining of frogs and fish. As they said in Magnolia \"it really happened\".\n\nBut what about raining spiders? It happened -- recently. In Australia, millions of baby spiders rained down, covering the entire countryside with silky webs. In Brazil, spider rain wasn't really rain -- but it was still terrifying.\n\nRaining blood? Well, it didn't really rain blood, except that one team -- The Kentucky Meat Storm -- when it did. Yes, the Kentucky Meat Storm.\n\nRaining snakes? It happened (though not exactly how most YouTube lists document). Raining worms? Oh yes. Even in the snowy mountains of Scandinavia -- in March.\n\nIn June 2009, the entire country of Japan was covered in tadpoles. They were first spotted in Ishikawa, on the West coast of Japan but dead tadpoles were reported in towns and cities everywhere.\n\nDid you know the famous 1958 horror movie \"The Blob\" is based on actual events? In 1950, Pennsylvania police officers documented an eye witness account of \"star jelly\", a gelatinous substance that either contains or does *not* contain DNA, depending on who you ask.\n\nA rain of animals is a rare meteorological phenomenon in which flightless animals fall from the sky.

Do you get ASMR tingles?\n\nIs this the first time you've heard of ASMR which stands for \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response\"? It might not mean what you think it means.\n\nMillions of people experience ASMR \"tingles\" when exposed to certain stimuli. Triggers like hair brushing, whispering, finger tapping, clicking, chewing and caring role-playing send shivers down some people's spine.\n\nThese same ASMR triggers are actually \"misophonic\" triggers for others; meaning these sounds cause negative responses. For example: nails on a chalkboard will drive some people *nuts* but others aren't affected.\n\nThe Why Files answers these questions and raises a few more.
