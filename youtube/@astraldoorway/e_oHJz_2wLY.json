and"},{"startMs":1233600,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"mechanically right so in order to put them all into motion at the same time then it is better"},{"startMs":1240560,"durationMs":10880,"subtitle":"to think of them all as a one thing they all mean one action one motion within us that sprouts

when we really practice it because you will see that you know you cannot really have"},{"startMs":1267440,"durationMs":9840,"subtitle":"birth without death and you cannot have death without sacrifice

what"},{"startMs":1286320,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"it really means to sacrifice oneself for others i think the first two factors are relatively

birth"},{"startMs":1305680,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"but um you know i'll be making more soon but yes um to clarify the third one because i think most"},{"startMs":1313600,"durationMs":11040,"subtitle":"of us interpret that as uh we have to do something extremely elevated right like like very uh"},{"startMs":1325280,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"holy acts of kindness like jesus did right but of course you know that's not necessarily the

spirituality to others as well and that's great um but also remember"},{"startMs":1343280,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"that this third factor of helping others first applies to where we find ourselves here and now"},{"startMs":1351920,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"and you know the people in our direct reality around us which in most cases means"},{"startMs":1360000,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"uh to be more selfless charitable compassionate attentive to our friends family

not"},{"startMs":1460960,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"saying that's wrong of course we have to study ourselves we have to find that connection within"},{"startMs":1466800,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"but it takes time we need patience and practice so again this is about balancing these three factors"},{"startMs":1475520,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"if we are just working on the ego but not helping others it becomes imbalanced we uh"},{"startMs":1483840,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"go
