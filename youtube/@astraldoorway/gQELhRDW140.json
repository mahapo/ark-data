natural power that they've been endowed with"},{"startMs":661980,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"so usually for a Sagittarius because of all of this energy they can be very impulsive doing"},{"startMs":669720,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"things without thinking sagittarians and also all of us during this time need to exercise

constant storms on that planet its"},{"startMs":744660,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"energy is very thunderous and volatile impulsive but also powerful and just like how fire can be"},{"startMs":752460,"durationMs":11040,"subtitle":"very useful for many things such as cooking lights heat it can also burn us too so this

reflect"},{"startMs":792540,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"philosophically which is part of sagittarius's purpose so with this understanding of this energy"},{"startMs":800280,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"you should be better be able to understand why the natives of Sagittarius famously love"},{"startMs":807420,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"Journeys Explorations Adventures Sports doing a lot of physical or sensual activities because"},{"startMs":814800,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"they just simply love it because Jupiter is what gives us this zest this sense of love for life"},{"startMs":822480,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"and passion for life natives of Sagittarius can also become very angry amidst all of that"},{"startMs":829740,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"very easily but also forgive very easily so you see it's a very fast-moving energy it's"},{"startMs":836100,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"a fast moving fire element it's like that it just wants to get to the point of things and"},{"startMs":844380,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"do and live and Achieve so this zest for life means they also love beautiful things like music"},{"startMs":852780,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"they have a great type of intelligence with that um they are also very commonly good musicians"},{"startMs":859620,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"at least for me every single Sagittarius I know is excellent at at least one type of instrument"},{"startMs":866460,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"sagittarians are also very tenacious even when it seems they've given up or failed or have been"},{"startMs":873300,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"defeated they suddenly out of nowhere have a huge burst of energy where they just keep going or even"},{"startMs":881400,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"if it's you know dangerous or the odds are against them they will just get up and be tenacious"},{"startMs":887160,"durationMs":9180,"subtitle":"so this current energy offers magnetism and heat and fire and warmth to do these things it is pure"},{"startMs":897180,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"storms and lightning bolts and it can really help us with the willpower to achieve our spiritual"},{"startMs":903540,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"goals Jupiter is also the representation of the personality so people born under
