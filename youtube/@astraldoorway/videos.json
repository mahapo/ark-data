We dive into the evolution of the soul, how our consciousness is composed of \"ego\" and \"essence\" ‚Äì and how the illumination of this leads to the awakening of consciousness and remembering past lives. We intimately understand how within the depths of our psyche holds the secret memories of our past existences and how this all relates to the Law of Karma, Law of Recurrence, & Law of Return (otherwise known as \"Reincarnation\").

Every time we sleep, we leave our physical bodies and dream in the\r astral plane unconsciously. Astral projection is simply about leaving the body consciously so that\r we no longer dream while asleep, and instead, explore the higher dimensions of \rreality with our consciousness awake. Astral projection is not dangerous, it is a\r natural birthright of all human beings.\r\r Mentally recite this mantra as you doze off peacefully to sleep, keeping the \rintention in your heart to experience the astral world consciously.\r\r This audio is simply an accompaniment to your practice. Your intention should be\r to go fully beyond the physical senses, including the sound or visuals of this video, in order to reach the non-physical state of consciousness that exists beyond the body. \r\rBe sure that you are sufficiently tired and relaxed before practicing. You must pass through\r the drowsiness of sleep in order to \"unbottle\" the consciousness from the physical body.\n\nResources:\n‚ùì FA RA ON Explained Step-by-Step: https://youtu.be/j6PJypJ-wtU\nüì∫ Free Astral Projection Course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbZsCM6xnLIUSoAysx8lzCkI5vIhNuzKx\nüìñ Free Astral Projection Book (Beyond Dreaming): https://youtu.be/OkhPITA2pU8\nüìö Free Astral Projection & Dream Yoga Course (Glorian): https://glorian.org/learn/courses-and-lectures/astral-projection-and-dream-yoga\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & our Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üåü\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#AstralTravel #OutofBodyExperience #AstralPlane","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0lrPvOzrHc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0lrPvOzrHc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0lrPvOzrHc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0lrPvOzrHc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J0lrPvOzrHc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":8,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"J0lrPvOzrHc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"UCJ0FM6kDcbHcT5G5cY1qqYXPK0","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LmFxMnMwZGVWX3Nv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-01T13:00:08Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Don't Underestimate Kundalini ‚Äì It Is Raised 7 Times!","description":"Awakening Kundalini & Chakras is much bigger than most people realize, and it's common for many to assume that it is a simple process, but the truth is infinitely more profound.

In Arms: The Difficult Path (Poem)","description":"In the beginning we renounce the entire world,\nDrowned in bitterness by the pain of existence,\nSeeking desperately for the promised pearl,\nWe march forward with terrible persistence.\n\nSeeking in the darkness amidst the muck,\nWe pray and pray to our Innermost Divinity,\nIt seems almost every turn brings a stroke of bad luck,       \nLonging forever and ever for the world of Infinity.\n\nAlthough we would like all the answers immediately,\nAt first we begin to see the dark tests of our Karma,\n‚ÄúYou must face your trials and tests‚Äù says Divinity,\nIn hopes that one day we generate our Dharma.\n\nUpon walking down the treacherous Path,\nOne faces the dangers of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôs‚Äù wrath.\nIt seems at times there could be no way out,\nLike exploring deep caves shouting ‚Äúlet me out!‚Äù\n\nEven envy fills the heart when we see others progress,\nBut we have never walked in another man‚Äôs shoes,\nSo our judgements are not a reason to digress,\nUnless we would like to abuse and confuse,\nOur comrade‚Äôs path if we choose.\n\nAmong the cries of such a terrible Path,\nWe find intriguing beings that make us laugh.\n‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù we ask,\n‚ÄúI am you‚Äù, as They reveal their mask.\n\nConfusion we feel when contemplating the Masters,\nAs we go through the trials of our own disasters‚Ä¶\nBut for our brothers and sisters we learn to sacrifice,\nWith our selfish ways being the only price.\n\nOnly then is our pain lessened through Unity,\nFor we FINALLY realize there is no ‚ÄúI‚Äù in ‚ÄúWe‚Äù,\nAnd ‚ÄúWe‚Äù hear the silent voice: ‚ÄúYou are in Me.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¶With a heart sweetened by the honey of God,\nWe resolve to renounce our filthy mud.\nWe no longer cry down the dark caves within,\nBut resolve to help others to find the strength to begin,\nThis difficult Path by holding hands as kin‚Ä¶\nGuided by the Bodhisattvas we find ourselves in.\n\nIn the end we realize love for the world and humanity,\nAnd no longer renounce our friends and family,\nBut willingly live in the heart of everyone‚Äôs calamity,\nShining light through the fire of alchemy!\n\nBitterness is the beginning,\nSweetness is the end,\nWe hear the bells ringing,\nBeing held by a friend.\n\nTrust and faith directs our path,\nGuided by a sacrificial heart,\nNo longer using the mind to calculate math,\nRealizing no progress is made apart.\n\nThe peace of God resounds deeply in the Being,\nSpreading the aroma of harmony unto all forms,\nAllowing all people to experiencing Seeing,\nWitnessing Nature‚Äôs power to transform.\n\nWhen stillness reigns,\nPure awe is it to see,\nUnshackling the chains,\nFrom the mind‚Äôs false decrees.\n\nWhen stillness reigns,\nA simple breath liberates,\nThe Christ within our veins,\nOnly our Mother awaits,\nFor our innocence to shine forth,\nIn death we find the power of rebirth.\n\nDeath, birth and sacrifice,\nWhat more does God want,\nUnless we want a fool‚Äôs paradise,\nThere‚Äôs no time to think twice,\nLess we fall into vice.\n\nMake way for God‚Äôs March until the end\nReaching out to overextend,\nAnd comprehend the real way to ascend,\nTotally absorbed in God‚Äôs love,\nFar, far above self-love,\nAnd deep, deep into the great beyond,\nWhere only the highest masters may respond.\n\nAbiding forever in the way of the Trinity,\nThank you, thank you, my protector, O Divinity,\nGuide me, guide me on my way, O Infinity.\n\nüëâ Free course on Path of the Bodhisattva (The Direct Path to the Absolute):

In the beginning, the technique in this audio may feel like an \"intellectual exercise\", but with consistent effort, the practice will move into \"the heart\". Then we can apply this type of \"cultivated self-illuminating awareness\" more intuitively to every ego-perception that presents itself to the canvas of the mind, profoundly deepening and accelerating our journey of Self-realization.\n\nThis type of meditation shows us, in a deep way, the difference between thoughts and awareness. Most of us are trapped in thoughts, very few know how to truly live in awareness. To think that we can go immediately into a permanent state of awakened consciousness is a fallacy of the mind. We must first learn about ourselves through in-depth self-comprehension. Then can we gradually liberate the mind from the many psychological elements and identifications that we call the ego. This is akin to shining a torch in a dark corridor to reveal the path ahead of us. In other words, we learn to shine the light of consciousness into the darkness of ego.\n\nAfter completing this meditation, pay attention to your dreams when you next sleep, as it‚Äôs expected you would have ‚Äúshifted‚Äù a lot of things internally and it‚Äôs likely that more answers to self-comprehension may come in the form of powerful symbols and metaphors. These types of vivid dreams include hidden clues from the Astral to help you understand your soul‚Äôs challenges in a deeper way.\n\nThe basic outline of this method is:\n‚Ä¢ Relaxation & pranayama (5 second box breath is used for pranayama & ‚Äòconnecting to solar energy‚Äô visualization is used for deep body relaxation. Note: you can use your own preferred pranayama or body relaxation technique)\n‚Ä¢ Recalling & re-living the memory of an ego-experience (Observation & Comprehension)\n‚Ä¢ Connecting to Divinity/Kundalini for help (Judgement & Elimination)\n‚Ä¢ Mantra \"KRIM\" 13 times (Optional but recommended)\n\nNote: The more challenging/dense an ego you choose, the greater the result of consciousness that will be liberated. Clues to identifying strongly rooted ego-patterns are found when we feel emotions such as guilt, shame, or remorse in relation to actions we committed during unconscious moments in our waking life.\n\nDon't overthink it!

After many experiences as a child and adult, and a deep connection to an inner divine thread, she was always called to study the esoteric and occult sciences. She particularly loves the work of the brilliant OGs like Rudolf Steiner. She is also a woman, friend, sister, birth keeper, doula, mizan therapist, astrologer, artist, and adventurer. She is also the host of Wisdom Weavers Podcast. She's from NYC but has lived in Europe the last few years, in a more adventurous, nomadic way. Birth keeping has led the way. She's supported dozens of births and birthing women + their partners + their families. She has also supported people dealing with loss, and believes the line between birth and death is quite thin. Both must be honored. No matter what she does in this world, the form may change, but the essence is the same, to self-realize and to be of service to women, children, humanity and to this planet.\"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsgcjKeysq0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsgcjKeysq0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsgcjKeysq0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsgcjKeysq0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QsgcjKeysq0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":48,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QsgcjKeysq0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"g6KctV4uL51Y2XNRK8z2ZuKG8Lc","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LjF2d1U4ZnVqRWNJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-28T13:00:48Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Wake Up & Fight!

At that time as well, the noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva, the great being, clearly beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom itself and saw that even the five aggregates are empty of intrinsic existence.\n\nThereupon, through the Buddha's inspiration, the venerable Shariputra spoke to the noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva, the great being, and said, \"How should any noble son or noble daughter who wishes to engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom train?\"\n\nWhen this had been said, the holy Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva, the great being, spoke to the venerable Shariputra and said, \"Shariputra, any noble son or noble daughter who so wishes to engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom should clearly see this way: they should see perfectly that even the five aggregates are empty of intrinsic existence. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; emptiness is not other than form, form too is not other than emptiness. Likewise, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness are all empty. Therefore, Shariputra, all phenomena are emptiness; they are without defining characteristics; they are not born, they do not cease; they are not defiled, they are not undefiled; they are not deficient, and they are not complete.\n\nTherefore, Shariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feelings, no perceptions, no mental formations, and no consciousness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, and no mind. There is no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no texture, and no mental objects. There is no eye-element and so on up to no mind-element including up to no element of mental consciousness. There is no ignorance, there is no extinction of ignorance, and so on up to no aging and death and no extinction of aging and death. Likewise, there is no suffering, origin, cessation, or path; there is no wisdom, no attainment, and even no non-attainment.\n\nTherefore, Shariputra, since bodhisattvas have no attainments, they rely on this perfection of wisdom and abide in it. Having no obscuration in their minds, they have no fear, and by going utterly beyond error, they will reach the end of nirvana. All the buddhas too who abide in the three times attained the full awakening of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment by relying on this profound perfection of wisdom.\n\nTherefore, one should know that the mantra of the perfection of wisdom - the mantra of great knowledge, the unexcelled mantra, the mantra equal to the unequalled, the mantra that quells all suffering - is true because it is not deceptive. The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed:\n\ntadyatha gat√© gat√© paragat√© parasamgat√© bodh√≠ svaha!\n\nShariputra, the bodhisattvas, the great beings, should train in the perfection of wisdom in this way.\n\nThereupon, the Blessed One arose from that meditative absorption and commended the holy Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva, the great being, saying this is excellent. \"Excellent! Excellent! O noble child, it is just so; it should be just so. One must practice the profound perfection of wisdom just as you have revealed. For then even the tathagatas will rejoice.\n\nAs the Blessed One uttered these words, the venerable Shariputra, the holy Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva, the great being, along with the entire assembly, including the worlds of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, all rejoiced and hailed what the Blessed One had said.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#HeartSutra #Buddhism #Prajnaparamita","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLRmhY2C0_g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLRmhY2C0_g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLRmhY2C0_g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLRmhY2C0_g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLRmhY2C0_g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":66,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NLRmhY2C0_g"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ATcIcPNEj4IwbDiwvcNlrOmKNzw","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LmczWUdDSFZLNm5V","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-28T13:00:19Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Finding The Great Emptiness: The Power of Perfect Wisdom","description":"The Prajnaparamita, or Heart Sutra, is one of the most powerful and transcendental teachings that the great Buddha Shakyamuni left us.

In the meantime, there's a Telegram group which you can join to study the teachings. If you're interested, watch through the video first and then decide whether you want to join. There are some advanced images and diagrams provided in the video to give you a sense of the depth of esoteric knowledge that the Gnostic teachings provides. Similarly, the four principles talked about in the video are just to give you a sense of the kind of devotion required in order to really understand the teachings. They are not strict rules per se, but rather core practices which will help us to gradually embody Gnosis at a fundamental level. For example, deep meditation gives us the clarity of mind through psychological comprehension that leads to the death of the ego, and sexual transmutation (suprasexuality) helps us to renounce the sensual pleasures of the physical world in order to have the energy to perceive and feel the suprasensual worlds (higher worlds/dimensions), which in time also creates the Solar Astral Body.\n\nIf you like the video, feel free to join the Telegram group called 'The Gnostic Method'.

Next to his mouth is the Tibetan letter Ha ‡Ωß. Above his head is a flame, and above that flame, the letter A ‡Ω®, and from that letter A ‡Ω® we see a splendorous radiation and then an image of heaven or nirvana (click here for the full image: https://i.imgur.com/Hl2QZQu.jpg)\n\nThis image is related to a tradition called Tummo, which is a particular type of technique that is taught in a variety of schools of Buddhism. In the Gnostic tradition we call it Pranayama. There are many varieties of Pranayama exercises. The Sanskrit word Pranayama means ‚Äúto harness the winds.‚Äù It is not referring to physical wind, but ethereal wind‚Äîin other words, what we call \"ether\". To harness the winds is to harness energies. Those energies is shown here in this path that leads to this temple in the internal (Astral) worlds. The yogi is using mantras; these letters are A and Ha, but they did not paint the whole mantra. The whole mantra is \"Ham-Sah\". The sound that makes the fire is: \"Ssssssssaaaahhh\".\n\nThe image shows the vowel Ha ‡Ωß by his mouth. When practicing the pranayama Ham-Sah, \"Ham\" is the mantra we pronounce mentally when we breathe in; we breathe in the air to take the vital currents, the ethereal currents, into the body. We imagine that energy rising up the spinal column as we mentally pronounce the mantra \"Haaaammmmm\", and all that energy is going up the spine into the brain. This brings the waters, from the bottom to the top, the lower waters to the upper waters, the waters of sex to the waters of the brain: \"Haaaammmm\". Then the fire that is in the water irradiates the brain, rejuvenates it, gives it life and energy, and then the Yogi says \"Ssssssssssaaaaaaahhhh\" with the exhalation. In total, this causes the fire in the waters to rise to the brain, illuminate the pineal gland, and open clairvoyance, to give us the power to see beyond the physical senses. It is very beautifully illustrated in this painting.\n\n0:00 - Explanation of the Breathwork\n4:48 - Guided Meditation\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#Pranayama #Tummo #Transmutation","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QhfpLYvjVN8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QhfpLYvjVN8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QhfpLYvjVN8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QhfpLYvjVN8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QhfpLYvjVN8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":74,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QhfpLYvjVN8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"-Hjo8Hy3ABV74GV7S9f7BY9VYcQ","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LkJaQVpHdjlOM2tZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-04T16:26:51Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"How To Pray More Deeply & Bring Intelligent Awareness To Your Problems","description":"What is prayer and its significance in relation to spiritual progression?

This episode is the most recommended one to watch out of this series because we learn the best way to work with all of the chakras in one sitting. As explained in the video, we take a look at the crucial role that the 'spirit', or 'soul', element has in influencing and governing all the other chakras and elements below, and how it has the power to revolutionize our entire energy system through the power of higher thought. The crown chakra is where we channel divine intuition (polyvoyance) from the Akashic field of omnipresent consciousness; this higher knowledge is received by the pineal gland and vibrates intimately with the pituitary gland for us to \"see\". Through connecting with such energies, we merge with the power of \"nothingness\", Brahman, the Logos, and the \"ultimate perception of reality\".\n\n0:00 - Introduction: Our Celestial Connection\n10:00 - Akashic Intuition & The Descent Of Higher Forces\n15:32 - Healing Mental Illness & Deep Meditation\n23:18 - Solitary Connectedness, Tantra & Inversion\n30:14 - Revolution, Karma & the Direction of Purification\n38:44 - The Practice: How to Awaken ALL the Chakras!\n45:01 - The End Goal, the Pranava Mantra & 5 Divine Rules\n\nüì∫ EPISODE NINE: https://youtu.be/oSdpbeDY8aM\n\nResources:\nüëâ Recommended Playlist on 'The Real Revolution': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQVzDTzpHXA&list=PL1n30s-LKus4wKy6tSVR4LjHIGrwkWC1u\nüëâ Alchemical Synthesis of the Soul PDF: https://glorian.org/images/stories/coursepdfs/machinery/Machinery%20of%20the%20Soul%2005%20The%20Alchemical%20Synthesis%20of%20the%20Soul.pdf\nüëâ FREE Astral Projection & Dream Yoga Course: https://glorian.org/learn/courses-and-lectures/astral-projection-and-dream-yoga\nüëâ Samsara & Nirvana: https://glorian.org/learn/courses-and-lectures/bhavachakra-the-wheel-of-becoming/samsara-and-nirvana\nüëâ Illuminating Void: https://glorian.org/learn/glossary/i/illuminating-void\nüëâ The Absolute: https://glorian.org/learn/glossary/a/absolute\nüëâ Atman: https://glorian.org/learn/glossary/a/atman\nüëâ Satcitananda: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satcitananda\nüëâ OM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om\nüëâ Pranava Yoga: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranava_yoga\nüëâ ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81\nüëâ Karma: https://glorian.org/books/beyond-death/the-mysteries-of-life-and-death/karma\nüëâ Fasting: https://www.healthyhildegard.com/spiritual-fasting/\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#Chakras #Sahasrara #CrownChakra","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKdN9uT7FUE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKdN9uT7FUE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKdN9uT7FUE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKdN9uT7FUE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKdN9uT7FUE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":83,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nKdN9uT7FUE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"q-rJx6iGpqCAFdNPus3oIbrxdJE","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LjRtb2RtX29BbkZ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-04-07T17:05:50Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Third Eye Guided Meditation: Attaining Inner Clarity ~ 432hz","description":"This meditation begins with music and then transitions into silence to encourage us to find our inner stillness and clarity of the mind.

This has both its positives and negatives; this episode covers why spiritual experiences should more often than not, be kept secret, or at the very least, we should understand the reasons behind why we share them through mindfulness and self-observation.

(Homemade Vipassana)","description":"This is a unique and transformative practice. If you‚Äôve tried every other Astral projection technique out there and still had no success, then this method is for you. It‚Äôs for you because you‚Äôre most likely missing the bridge to the deeper spiritual dimension of consciousness that allows for these experiences to manifest more naturally. This technique is more like a home-made ‚Äúretreat‚Äù, a devotional and wholesome practice which focuses on raising your entire level of being. ‚ÄúRetreat‚Äù means to step back - not only from the outer world, but also from your head, the thinking mind. I call this 'The Presence Method'.\n\nEven if you don't choose to practice this exact method, just contemplating what's said in this episode may help a lot, and you may incorporate these teachings into your life however you please.\n\n‚ÄúImpeccability begins with a single act that has to be deliberate, precise and sustained. If that act is repeated long enough, one acquires a sense of unbending intent which can be applied to anything else [Astral projection]. If that is accomplished the road is clear. One thing will lead to another until the warrior realizes his full potential.‚Äù ~ Don Juan Matus (Wisdom From native American Toltec Shamanism)\n\nüëâ Satori Awakening in Zen Buddhism: https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/satori-awakening\nüëâ Ego & the Principle of Conserving Energy: https://youtu.be/bAyR0pQ9sJA\nüëâ Astral Projection Mantra: https://youtu.be/j6PJypJ-wtU\nüëâ Spiritual Superiority: https://youtu.be/0LK1Fy6MgQE\n\nHere‚Äôs a very short summary of this practice; these steps will only make sense if you listen to the entire episode first:\n\n~ 1. Devote three or more days where you can practice this in solitude away from the distractions of the world and its unconscious dreams.\n~ 2. Stay active, healthy, meditate often and configure your awareness to be always aware of all your senses of the physical world, as well as your internal world.\n~ 3. Stay balanced, focused and grounded based on your passion to enter other worlds [Astral projection/different dimensions of consciousness]. Stay devotedly aware of your intent while old unconscious patterns, thoughts and egoic dreams try to come back into your life while you‚Äôre on this ‚Äúretreat‚Äù.\n~ 4. If you‚Äôre focusing too much on future achievements during this time, say to yourself, ‚ÄúI am Astral projecting‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am in the Astral plane‚Äù. Look around in wonder, engage your higher awareness, relax, be empty, let life happen to you instead of you trying to impose a reality on it.\n~ 5. As the foundations of your consciousness transform the very structure of yourself, there will be times of struggle, of going back and forth from consciousness to ego. Use the awareness of your own death as an anchor to remind you that nothing else matters in this world of illusion. Realise deeply that the past and future are not real; only the aliveness of this present moment exists here and now. Remember that the 'Astral Body' is also known as the 'Emotional Body' or 'Energy Body'; be deeply aware of internal and external emotions, energies and senses at all times.\n~ 6. At night, wake up every two hours during your sleep and reconfigure your awareness back on the present moment. This is an intensive sleeping exercise to significantly boost your Astral projection experiences. You may utilise any or none Astral projection methods during any of the times you wake up and go back to sleep. Remember to recall any dreams or experiences every time you wake up.\n~ 7. When you finish the three or more days, strive to bring your cultivated awareness with you back into the ordinary world in simple, silent, empty humility. Focus on peace. This entire practice will not just be beneficial for three days, it will stay with you for as long as you can honour it.\n\nüëâ The Teachings of Don Juan: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Teachings-of-Don-Juan-Audiobook/B01JZNJZWQ\nüëâ The Power of Now: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Power-of-Now-Audiobook/B002V0PN36\nüëâ Practicing the Power of Now: https://www.audible.com/pd/Practicing-the-Power-of-Now-Audiobook/B002UZMZFQ\nüëâ A New Earth: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-New-Earth-Audiobook/B002V0RAUU\nüëâ What Does Being Present Mean? https://youtu.be/L-HWfAZlAbI\nüëâ How to Practice Being Present Everyday: https://youtu.be/U_vkVDEPPUI\nüëâ Recommended Reading for Purifying Your Imagination: https://glorian.org/learn/courses-and-lectures/meditation-essentials/meditation-essentials-09-imagination\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!

Develop a mindset that never asks \"How long does it take to Astral project?\" - shift your perspective on spiritual awakening and understand how the flowering of consciousness is a joyful long-term learning process.\n\nüëâ Guided meditation for moving beyond negative self-limiting beliefs:\nhttps://youtu.be/rnKyLYC_FhM\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#AstralTravel #Spirituality #Astral","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HuKJxy6l2oI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HuKJxy6l2oI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HuKJxy6l2oI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HuKJxy6l2oI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HuKJxy6l2oI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":103,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HuKJxy6l2oI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"o6QDgiszGYb4QZAGoNcr-ucrRY0","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LmVvcUxmMUdYbURv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-04T18:43:00Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"How to Use Your Relationship for Spiritual Awakening","description":"What is a conscious relationship?

Through understanding these aspects, we also gain a sense of why Astral projection may not have happened for us yet, and more deeply understand reasons why we should be more patient with ourselves on this path towards awakening consciousness.\n\nKeep in mind that the spiritual energy saved up doesn't derive from our ego, it derives from a lack of ego, therefore it is universal energy, which is available in abundance when we open ourselves up to it and allow it to energise us. This is our natural state. It's an illusion to think we use our own egoic energy for Astral projection. This is why it's common to wake up feeling energised and healed after being out of body.\n\nIf you're interested in the native American shaman, Don Juan Matus and his wisdom, then check out the following books by Carlos Castaneda in the order below (also look up Peter Coyote for fantastic audiobook versions of some of the books):\n\n1. The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge\n2. A Separate Reality: Further Conversations with Don Juan\n3. Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don JuanTales of Power\n4. The Second Ring of Power\n5. The Eagle's Gift\n6. The Power of Silence: Further Lessons of Don Juan\n7. The Art of Dreaming\n8. The Active Side of Infinity\n\nAfter you're finished with Carlos Castaneda's book, I highly recommend reading books by Merilyn Tunneshende, who was Don Juan's second and final apprentice. Here are her books, in the order below:\n\n1. Medicine Dream: A Nagual Woman's Energetic Healing\n2. Twilight Language of the Nagual: The Spiritual Power of Shamanic Dreaming\n3. Don Juan and the Art of Sexual Energy: The Rainbow Serpent of the Toltecs\n\nAs well as these, I am once again recommending the following audiobook, which covers one of the simplest way to transcend the ego - The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle:\nhttps://www.audible.com/pd/The-Power-of-Now-Audiobook/B002V0PN36?qid=1625312289&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=2F121WV61EHXK9SK2QJJ\n\n\"Stoicism\":\nIntroduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFkyxzJtiv4\nPrinciples: https://www.njlifehacks.com/what-is-stoicism-overview-definition-10-stoic-principles/\n\n\"Teme Nosce ~ Know Thyself\":\nhttps://evolveconsciousness.org/know-thyself-the-importance-of-understanding-the-functionality-of-consciousness-psyche-mind-self-etc/\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#Shamanism #Spirituality #Astral","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAyR0pQ9sJA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAyR0pQ9sJA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAyR0pQ9sJA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAyR0pQ9sJA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAyR0pQ9sJA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":128,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bAyR0pQ9sJA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Uwvn0TWj5XQ5GPKZiBcgGW17kxo","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LnNNR0RrR2JfNXRV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-06-26T12:27:17Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Meeting \"Zombies\" in the Lower Astral & Ascending to an Oceanic Planet","description":"In this experience, I found myself in the Lower Astral where I was faced with gravely unconscious humans.

One of the main points here is that yes, Astral projection is ultimately safe and in most cases you'll wake up if you have a bad experience. However, these negative experiences can ruin or end our OBEs, when it doesn't have to be like that. So these are ways to handle those situations instead of just feeling fear or waking up.\n\nAn extra tip to note is that evil beings usually try to hypnotise you into a trance-like state. Therefore, if you meditate often and understand how not to be hypnotised by your own thoughts, then you naturally won't be as easily hypnotised in the Astral either - just something to think about!\n\nInformation about the spiritual influence of Mars:\nhttps://www.gnosticmuse.com/mars-red-planet-of-force-strength/#:~:text=Mars%2C%20or%20Ares%20in%20Latin%2C%20is%20the%20ancient,and%20Remus%2C%20founders%20of%20the%20city%20of%20Rome.\nhttps://www.liveabout.com/mars-in-aries-mars-signs-206513\n\nAbout the mantra & pentagram (you can also use the pentagram as a form of protection if you frame a picture of it in your room or on your altar):\nhttps://glorian.org/connect/blog/circle-of-protection\nhttps://glorian.org/books/the-perfect-matrimony/the-five-pointed-star?highlight=WyJwZW50YWdyYW0iXQ==\nhttps://glorian.org/connect/blog/the-pentagram?highlight=WyJwZW50YWdyYW0iXQ==\nhttps://glorian.org/connect/blog/explanation-of-the-esoteric-pentagram?highlight=WyJwZW50YWdyYW0iXQ==\nhttps://glorian.org/learn/courses-and-lectures/defense-for-spiritual-warfare/the-pentagram-the-microcosmic-star\n\nHow to burn resin as incense.

What is the Astral body? Astral Projection is our natural ability to consciously leave the physical body during sleep. We explore beyond the limitations of physical reality with our Astral Body, which exists as part of our higher consciousness. Watch this motivational video for spiritual awakening, which is intended to inspire one to reach beyond the mere physicality of three-dimensional life and explore fifth-dimensional realities of consciousness; the Astral Plane.\n\nOne core approach to Astral projection is by living intensely in the present moment in physical life; by doing so, one will also begin to be more present in sleep. Consequently, one will have a much greater chance of having the profound experience of consciously leaving the body during sleep because awareness has been habitually trained to notice whether it's in physical reality or not. Being present also stops the mind from overthinking and adding unconscious 'dream-narrative' over reality, and thus you stop living mechanically and cease creating unconscious dreams. As above, so below; when you stop dreaming during the day, you stop dreaming at night. Astral projection is synonyms with the awakening of consciousness.\n\nOne powerful way to strengthen ourselves in the present moment and firmly ground our intent to Astral project is meditation. In meditation we are more able to gain clarity, focus, and plant seeds of intent into our subconscious. During meditation, you can firmly say to yourself \"I WILL Astral project\", feel and trust your subconscious to do the work. Expect experiences throughout your sleep, and make sure to recall any experiences that you may have had. Persistence and consistency is key.\n\nRecommended audiobook for becoming more present: https://www.audible.ca/pd/The-Power-of-Now-Audiobook/B071RXX33T\n\nHere's an excerpt from the book to elaborate on what I said in the video about \"thinking and analyzing is becoming old-fashioned and destructive\":\n\nQuestioner: \"I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn't mind learning to think more clearly in a more focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, we would be just another species of animal.\"\n\nEckhart Tolle: \"The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness. We need to go onto the next stage now as a matter of urgency, otherwise we will be destroyed by the mind which has grown into a monster. Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought. When you root yourself in consciousness, you gain more control over your mind.\"\n\nWant to know the difference between lucid dreaming and Astral projection?

This guided meditation can be used daily, for clarity and well-being, which naturally arises when we reclaim our awareness from compulsive thinking. We do this by anchoring ourselves in the body, the breath and the present moment, fully accepting our current emotional and mental state, and then going beyond it.\n\nThe practice of becoming more conscious of our thoughts ultimately enables us to be more aware of our dreams, and increases the ability to maintain a peaceful mind. In this freedom of mind, we are more prepared to access lucid dreaming & Astral projection, and it also helps us to maintain focus and be more grounded in these experiences.\n\nThis type of meditation can have powerful and lasting effects on the mind and body. Especially when practiced consistently as your mental strength and growing awareness spills into your daily life, and into your consciousness when you sleep.\n\n*This is primarily a silent meditation however feel free to play musicbehind it if you wish.\n\n*You can keep your eyes open if you like, but preferably keep them closed.\n\nSupport Astral Doorway on Patreon & join my Discord group for live Q&As, guided meditations, dream interpretations, early-access episodes, news about my upcoming books, spiritual advice & more: https://www.patreon.com/astraldoorway üíõ\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#GuidedMeditation #Consciousness #AstralTravel","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HOaSzuY1J4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HOaSzuY1J4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HOaSzuY1J4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HOaSzuY1J4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4HOaSzuY1J4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":138,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4HOaSzuY1J4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"lgwXR3v7oqW3PLhbE9bybhtdhAc","id":"VVV5ODZ1YjFYdlNMbGdyVGU4d1F3X2x3LmhQWkw4bTlSSWtR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-05-01T12:02:00Z","channelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","title":"Attending a Class in the Astral with Unconscious Students","description":"In this experience, I stumbled upon a temple in the Astral plane, but this was no ordinary temple.

They did this by habit rather than by conscious intention; people are unconsciously on their phones in waking life and they're also unconsciously on their phones in the Astral too; As above, so below. In the Astral, we can conjure up many types of objects with the power of our Imagination and Will.\n\nIf any of you ever need clarification on anything on any of my videos, I am more than happy to answer your questions.\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please like, subscribe & share!\n\n#AstralTravel #AstralPlane #Astral","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kaovp2Gci7A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kaovp2Gci7A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kaovp2Gci7A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kaovp2Gci7A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kaovp2Gci7A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Astral Doorway","playlistId":"UUy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw","position":142,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Kaovp2Gci7A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Astral Doorway","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCy86ub1XvSLlgrTe8wQw_lw"}}]
