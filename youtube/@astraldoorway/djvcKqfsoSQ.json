focusing on uh the the elements of fire internal death and also"},{"startMs":700020,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"um focusing more on the the higher chakras the developing your intuition right the third eye and"},{"startMs":707040,"durationMs":9000,"subtitle":"the crown chakra so it goes like this now if you can't roll your r's don't worry but I will

last variation which is the following"},{"startMs":780420,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"and I'll say it which is"},{"startMs":794160,"durationMs":1980,"subtitle":"so sorry"},{"startMs":808260,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"foreign"},{"startMs":815520,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"okay now of course prolong it so make it longer with the S as"},{"startMs":820920,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"well uh for example if I do uh the last one here"},{"startMs":830700,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"okay it doesn't have to be exactly how I do it do what comes best for you and of course these are"},{"startMs":837540,"durationMs":10200,"subtitle":"all all of these ones are following um uh these exactly okay uh the order so and it's the the same"},{"startMs":847740,"durationMs":12000,"subtitle":"order of this uh but you know remove the the um now if you want to you can absolutely when you're"},{"startMs":859740,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"going through these Cycles remember we start from the top to the bottom okay because the top chakras"},{"startMs":866160,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"should should uh you know in a to speak in a more Frank way they should dominate the lower"},{"startMs":872940,"durationMs":9060,"subtitle":"chakras because these are our animalistic Primal uh nature right and these should govern uh these"},{"startMs":882000,"durationMs":8580,"subtitle":"when our lower chakras control our and possess our higher chakras that's when we act unconsciously so"},{"startMs":890580,"durationMs":9540,"subtitle":"at the moment we're inverted right so this whole process is to uh uh inverse in in the normal way"},{"startMs":900120,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"uh for us to have Clarity over our unconscious nature okay so yes if when you're doing these"},{"startMs":909480,"durationMs":14160,"subtitle":"chakras you can absolutely uh add the um and this okay so if we're doing that and you can do and"},{"startMs":925380,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"and then starts again okay and just keep cycling through it in concentration deep meditation okay"},{"startMs":933420,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"and another thing to clarify as well if you uh are wondering because I I've seen the questions"},{"startMs":942360,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"um you know should I do it mentally or vocally you can do either if you don't"},{"startMs":948360,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"have any privacy and people are going to think you know what the you know what are you doing"},{"startMs":955140,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"um and then do it mentally but if you have the privilege of doing it outwardly that would be very"},{"startMs":961740,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"good too but also and you know this is a reminder I think I already said it but when you're doing"},{"startMs":968880,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"the mantras and you're doing doing it for a long session ideally you know like at least an hour"},{"startMs":976200,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"um you'll find that after maybe 30 minutes of doing it vocally you'll find yourself getting"},{"startMs":981300,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"a little bit uh sleepy in a way you know a bit more drowsy you're going into a deeper state"},{"startMs":987900,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"right you're going into your unconscious mind in a clear way you're in an esoteric way of speaking"},{"startMs":996060,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"you're descending into your uh inner earth you're going down into your own mineral Kingdom or your"},{"startMs":1005660,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"own hell quote unquote hell right to to bring light into the darkness and so when you feel that"},{"startMs":1014540,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"you can start to do them more quietly more slowly and eventually transition into doing"},{"startMs":1021200,"durationMs":9300,"subtitle":"them mentally right so you start off with in and and then eventually as you're coming"},{"startMs":1030500,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"to the end or you're becoming a bit more you feel so much Stillness within your body within"},{"startMs":1035900,"durationMs":10200,"subtitle":"yourself then you start saying it more quietly in and on and eventually uh you do it mentally"},{"startMs":1046100,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"and then eventually just silence okay this would uh be a very good practice to do every day and"},{"startMs":1053420,"durationMs":10260,"subtitle":"you'll Advance very fast if if done every day consistently okay so um ah there is uh just one"},{"startMs":1063680,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"more variation that I want to share uh from my my friend uh who I I I shared her YouTube channel"},{"startMs":1072080,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"called the three mountains I'll put it in the description uh I recommend seeing her videos too"},{"startMs":1077660,"durationMs":9480,"subtitle":"they you know you can start them from video one to uh I think 118 uh they're quite short videos"},{"startMs":1088280,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and I think you'll enjoy them um and I'll share the specific video as well where she gives her"},{"startMs":1094880,"durationMs":11040,"subtitle":"kind of variation of what she does okay so uh she likes to do uh specifically this one in and um"},{"startMs":1108020,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"I'll remove the m and the s and she says in this video that you know you can"},{"startMs":1117260,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"uh replace the in with Isis right which is of course the Egyptian god Egyptian"},{"startMs":1126380,"durationMs":10020,"subtitle":"goddess and this is this adds the S sound okay um so instead of the in you can do is"},{"startMs":1142400,"durationMs":12300,"subtitle":"and n that's fine and but and instead of on you can do om this adds the sacral chakra uh"},{"startMs":1154700,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"vowel the m and then oon and an is there okay"},{"startMs":1164240,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"but you could also just do if you don't want to do the n okay so you know you"},{"startMs":1173600,"durationMs":11220,"subtitle":"can uh change it in this way okay so on her video you'll see that she teaches and then n"},{"startMs":1186140,"durationMs":12240,"subtitle":"um oh what did I do that oh yes ooh and ah okay so um yes I think that's everything for now this is"},{"startMs":1198380,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"another variation uh by now I know a lot of you really enjoyed the my videos on on the chakras"},{"startMs":1205760,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and a lot of you are you know vocalizing these and seeing a lot of benefits as well"},{"startMs":1212480,"durationMs":11100,"subtitle":"um it's really amazing to see so maybe your uh ego is getting tired obviously"},{"startMs":1223580,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"the practice is to not get tired of repeating to Just Surrender ourselves to the practice"},{"startMs":1231800,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"and without expectation too and just doing these for about an hour a day you know you"},{"startMs":1239540,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"if you can't commit to an hour because I know that's a that's a long time for a lot"},{"startMs":1243740,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"of novices for a lot of beginners um just do what you can 20 minutes 30 minutes even if you have to"},{"startMs":1251240,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"start from five minutes or ten minutes that's fine you know we all have to start somewhere"},{"startMs":1256700,"durationMs":9840,"subtitle":"but if you can do this practice for uh one hour a day um you will progress in a fast way okay"},{"startMs":1267920,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"um but yes as I was saying you know the ego gets uh tired right of"},{"startMs":1276920,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"um doing the same thing so if for example"},{"startMs":1282080,"durationMs":11820,"subtitle":"um personally I've been I've just felt a a calling to do the uh this one the cheese chess chores"},{"startMs":1293900,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"I just I don't know I feel the power in this one and I really like it and I also add the um"},{"startMs":1302300,"durationMs":9000,"subtitle":"afterwards or sometimes just that because there's already this but uh you know uh do it any way you"},{"startMs":1311300,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"like ah and one more um clarification is that you don't need to uh vocalize these mantras"},{"startMs":1322340,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"one
