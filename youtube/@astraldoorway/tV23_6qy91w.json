is"},{"startMs":221680,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"just us it's just the self it's just subconscious so it's really good to know ourselves in that way"},{"startMs":229840,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"but of course like you're trying to sort of allude to uh it is is we are kind of like a caterpillar"},{"startMs":238080,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"trying to to come out of its shell and and to have that selflessness to have that ability to"},{"startMs":244160,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"not think of ourselves anymore and actually see reality beyond our own subjectivity so"},{"startMs":252720,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"and you may already know but uh a good practice you know during meditation"},{"startMs":259040,"durationMs":10000,"subtitle":"um is to just keep trying to not identify with these thoughts and really observe yourself so"},{"startMs":270400,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"as you said we have that practice in meditation to find that stillness to find that silence"},{"startMs":277200,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"and it's not so much ignoring the thoughts but just understanding them um and also not"},{"startMs":283680,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"identifying with them really seeing them as like a just this have a curiosity like a another person"},{"startMs":291760,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"like a strange entity or whether whatever but what you're saying is that you take too"},{"startMs":297360,"durationMs":9840,"subtitle":"much interest in that and kind of the root of that that interest is a sort of uh fascination you know"},{"startMs":309280,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"a sort of almost like a hypnotization which is rooted in our attachments to those same thoughts"},{"startMs":316320,"durationMs":8960,"subtitle":"and our uh identification almost believing that you know this is us and so there's an attachment"},{"startMs":325280,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"there because we really believe ourselves we we enjoy we like these certain thoughts we find it"},{"startMs":331760,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"interesting and i would say because you're so analytic and that's not a bad thing we need i"},{"startMs":338560,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"know a lot of people who don't have the ability to analyze and it's it's a sad state of affairs"},{"startMs":344160,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"we need to be able to analyze but so for people like that i usually say okay you need to practice"},{"startMs":351920,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"at analyzation you need to be interested you need to know yourself but for someone like you i would"},{"startMs":358320,"durationMs":9280,"subtitle":"usually recommend that look the ability to analyze you have a gift i'm not sure if you're a virgo but"},{"startMs":368240,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"almost every virgo i know is uh is very analytical they overthink so for people like that uh and it's"},{"startMs":376640,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"a in particularly women as well for some reason i'm just stereotyping now that women think a lot"},{"startMs":382480,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"but for people like that it's best to keep working on being finding that peace within ourselves"},{"startMs":393120,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"making the decision not to identify with our past our personal history anymore recognizing it"},{"startMs":400160,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"as our ego and not really reality of here and now and really keep working on you know say"},{"startMs":408960,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"if you

you"},{"startMs":438320,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"worked more on getting away from that analytic mindset because it's in your nature to be analytic"},{"startMs":445040,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"so you don't have to make any effort whatsoever to really be that interested or in in being"},{"startMs":450640,"durationMs":9200,"subtitle":"analytic and things like that so yeah my my advice is really to work more on um on finding really"},{"startMs":459840,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"finding a a stillness and a deep connection with your own silent being try to have that in your day"},{"startMs":468800,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"like 60 to 70 percent because if it's the other way around like we're analyzing 70 of the time"},{"startMs":476480,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"then uh it usually dominates any sense of peace so if you can have the peace for like 70 of the"},{"startMs":484400,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"day and only and only keep a shorter practice of analyzing and comprehending yourself then"},{"startMs":490560,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"that's usually a bit better but if it's all day i mean that that's how we spend our day then
