world"},{"startMs":502320,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"of suffering then this distinction alone between these two worlds creates this inner

suffer consciously out"},{"startMs":570960,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"in the world at the same time because it's the external world that can show us"},{"startMs":577500,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"through our sufferings and egoic reactions what Darkness still lies within so that we"},{"startMs":585780,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"can see what egoic patterns remain within our vibration so that we can eventually clean it up"},{"startMs":594720,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"and so many people ask this question how can I master my ongoing

see they become adepts of the being and inepts of the world or amateurs of the world"},{"startMs":637260,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"so this can start to be comprehended more by reflecting back on

know"},{"startMs":822960,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"perhaps the best advice we can practice then is look if you want to transcend yourself"},{"startMs":830880,"durationMs":11700,"subtitle":"you have to die and only die do not want anything else but only learn how to die"},{"startMs":843720,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"whatever comes after that will be your own rebirth your own

so"},{"startMs":908100,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"imagine a person who wants to take up meditation only to experience nice happy Blissful things"},{"startMs":918240,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"this person will gain very little self-knowledge and very little true illumination"},{"startMs":926520,"durationMs":11160,"subtitle":"so the true path of Awakening is not of rainbows but more like skulls right it's not so much about"},{"startMs":938220,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"finding happiness we can truth we can do that quite easily to find happiness but it's a"},{"startMs":945420,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"temporary fleeting happiness we have to go through the door of psychological death in order to find"},{"startMs":952560,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"true happiness okay so in the Gnostic teachings there's a saying Live Your Karma consciously"},{"startMs":961260,"durationMs":8760,"subtitle":"because you cannot avoid it this means pay attention to it pay attention to your

judgment"},{"startMs":983400,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"without personal preference without moral beliefs without reaction to what you perceive internally"},{"startMs":992100,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"but just see it so what I'm trying to get at is through meditation and spiritual practices"},{"startMs":999420,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"there is the possibility to psych ourselves into our own imagined version of perfection"},{"startMs":1007700,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"this is not real Perfection this is not real absolute it is imagined absolute"},{"startMs":1015140,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"it is a

too"},{"startMs":1042260,"durationMs":9300,"subtitle":"strongly with this how are you going to relate to the world right so everyone's talking about"},{"startMs":1052460,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"the benefits of meditation and I'm talking here more about the possible risk of it let's say

that"},{"startMs":1091640,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"we get very caught up in following a Doctrine blindly without any of our own

it"},{"startMs":1116360,"durationMs":10800,"subtitle":"is just a teaching on carefulness that's all I'm all I'm saying here is to be careful be mindful"},{"startMs":1127160,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and always reassess what your goal is what you want and why you're doing what you're doing"},{"startMs":1134000,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"this whole problem could be compared to like dipping our toes into mud and when we feel"},{"startMs":1142220,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"we're just a little bit dirty we start to clean ourselves with spiritual practices protections"},{"startMs":1148700,"durationMs":9480,"subtitle":"mantras prayers Etc and we re we repeat this process of when we see dirt we clean it"},{"startMs":1160880,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"without never really knowing what that dirt is and where it came from"},{"startMs":1169220,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"when actually if we want

anymore"},{"startMs":1199040,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"so you see we're always trying to be good trying to be perfect trying to be better"},{"startMs":1205520,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"trying to be something more but we don't understand that to actually achieve that"},{"startMs":1212540,"durationMs":9900,"subtitle":"it requires knowing how to truly let the dirt be first and then eventually die"},{"startMs":1223580,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"because our Consciousness begins to grow and it is inevitable that this dirt will go"},{"startMs":1231320,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"but as
