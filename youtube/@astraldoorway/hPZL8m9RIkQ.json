still"},{"startMs":293280,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"there and frankly it looked meek in comparison to this magnificent temple, so i was a little

to"},{"startMs":310400,"durationMs":9840,"subtitle":"this huge wooden doorway, an astral doorway so to speak excuse the pun, now i opened the door"},{"startMs":321440,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"and

nod,"},{"startMs":361840,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"even though the temple was majestic on the outside it was surprisingly quite basic and"},{"startMs":367600,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"humble

stage was a woman... now i'll call"},{"startMs":381840,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"her the priestess, which is fitting since this was taking place in a temple and she was leading this"},{"startMs":391840,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"sort of class she was sitting down behind a standard school looking desk on a very basic chair"},{"startMs":399760,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"now what really caught my attention and piqued my interest was that she was wearing a robe which was"},{"startMs":406480,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"white and silver, now something i've not shared yet is that i used to be part of a Gnostic group"},{"startMs":414320,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"for some years where we learned about various esoteric things and one of those things that my"},{"startMs":419840,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"teacher at the time revealed to me was that it's common for spiritual masters in the astral

pure"},{"startMs":433680,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"and good intention, uh and similarly just to let you all know if you see someone wearing"},{"startMs":440720,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"black and red robes then they're supposed to usually be from a darker background and"},{"startMs":446160,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"they probably practice things which are of a more negative nature, so as i looked at her"},{"startMs":452880,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"we made eye contact even though i was at the back of the building telepathically she welcomed"},{"startMs":458480,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"me and said hello and she recognized me as being conscious compared to everyone else in the church"},{"startMs":466800,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"now this sort of communication in the astral is a sort of norm over there it's not"},{"startMs":473440,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"unusual to communicate information to others in this way, so yeah i liked this priestess"},{"startMs":481200,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"she seemed powerful and wise i had an immediate sense of admiration for her she smiled"},{"startMs":490000,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"at me i smiled back and she kindly communicated that this was a sort of basic public teaching and"},{"startMs":498080,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"that everyone here was asleep; asleep in the sense that their consciousness was asleep, she basically"},{"startMs":505040,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"said that i didn't really need to be there but i was welcome, of course i wanted to stay i was very"},{"startMs":511600,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"interested in how all of this worked i was very curious uh you know the idea of people leaving"},{"startMs":519520,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"the body unconsciously at night has been playing on my mind for a while so this was the perfect"},{"startMs":526320,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"opportunity to observe what people are like in these states, i also noticed that while me"},{"startMs":533200,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"and the priestess were looking at each other and communicating telepathically i could tell"},{"startMs":539840,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"that at the same time she was still talking to other people as if she were multitasking on some"},{"startMs":547520,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"level that's incomprehensible to me to be honest so she was clearly a skilled being"},{"startMs":554880,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"i'm reminded of hindu gods who are depicted with many heads because that is basically what i saw i"},{"startMs":563600,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"like the picture you can see on the screen, so i tried to pay attention to what she was teaching"},{"startMs":571200,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"i heard people asking questions about god and the priestess quoting verses from the"},{"startMs":576640,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"quran and the bible but i was more interested in the people, everyone looked should i say"},{"startMs":583840,"durationMs":8320,"subtitle":"too happy it was almost a bit creepy actually like they were overly fascinated with the class"},{"startMs":592720,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"it was strange, a strange energy, it's like when people get too immersed with a tv show and they"},{"startMs":601440,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"forget themselves, and as i was looking at everyone a group of about five people from the middle row"},{"startMs":608080,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"were looking at me smiling and invited me to sit next to them, a part of me recognized them but i"},{"startMs":615760,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"didn't really know who they were on the level of my usual physical mind they clearly knew"},{"startMs":622240,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"who i was though so i was a little confused but i just got up anyway and sat next to them they were"},{"startMs":629200,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"super friendly smiley and welcoming there was a real sense of friendship and that i knew them it"},{"startMs":636800,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"was nice but a little strange too but i just carried on anyway, perhaps i've unconsciously"},{"startMs":643680,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"attended classes with these people before who knows anyway, after the priestess had finished"},{"startMs":650400,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"speaking for some time she came down from the stage and she proceeded to ask everyone to get out"},{"startMs":656880,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"their masks which they must have made towards the beginning of the class now i looked on and wonder"},{"startMs":663280,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"at everyone getting out these wooden masks as if the priestess had made them do an arts"},{"startMs":669840,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and craft lesson beforehand they were really interesting to look at each one was different"},{"startMs":676800,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"now i tried to look online for what these looked the closest to and i found that they"},{"startMs":682560,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"look very similar to these old shamanic masks which you can see on the screen"},{"startMs":689600,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"it was fairly clear to me that the priestess was doing a lesson on the ego that's my guess anyway"},{"startMs":698160,"durationMs":9200,"subtitle":"you can take your own guess at what i'm going to describe... for me the mask was symbolic for what"},{"startMs":707360,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"kind of ego or facade we all live behind, so yeah as everyone was taking out their masks they were"},{"startMs":715520,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"showing each other they were very excited very proud of what they had made i felt a little left"},{"startMs":721440,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"out because i was empty-handed and didn't have one to show off but it was fine i was happy watching"},{"startMs":728160,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"now once the priestess had everyone's attention again she began one by one taking someone's mask"},{"startMs":737280,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"inspected it and then used what i'll describe as a magic pen which she simply tapped on the mask"},{"startMs":746080,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"and the mask would slowly turn into gold, turning it from this rugged imperfect wooden mask"},{"startMs":753440,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"to a perfectly splendorous and shining golden mask, she did this to everyone's mask one by one, when"},{"startMs":762080,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"she got to one woman this woman became distressed and was almost crying saying \"i don't want my mask"},{"startMs":769760,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"turning into gold, please!\" but the priestess just calmly took it from her anyway and she said in"},{"startMs":776800,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"a profound and slow way whilst looking into her eyes... \"this is necessary\" and she turned her mask"},{"startMs":785360,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"into gold and the woman took the mask back just silent and staring at her new and improved mask"},{"startMs":794800,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"now at this point the previously excited atmosphere had mysteriously shifted and"},{"startMs":802080,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"there was a silence as everyone looked on in awe at what the priestess was doing"},{"startMs":810320,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"there seemed to be a shift in consciousness and i sensed that there was definitely some kind of"},{"startMs":818720,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"subconscious learning that was taking place, as the priestess continued to each person eventually she"},{"startMs":826080,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"came to me i felt a bit awkward because i didn't have a mask but instead she approached me and"},{"startMs":832800,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"smiled and gently held up my wrist revealing a bracelet with a crucifix pendant on it and"},{"startMs":840960,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"she turned the pendant into gold, i was quite surprised and she just smiled i said thank you"},{"startMs":849920,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"i didn't really know what to make of it to be honest i was in awe like everyone else"},{"startMs":857520,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"i don't exactly know what was meant by the gold it sounds as if the teaching was to imply"},{"startMs":865280,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"that we must work on or perfect our egos, our masks that we live behind"},{"startMs":873520,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"we have to polish or improve our personality, or psychological state, that's my guess"},{"startMs":882240,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"you know because for me when i first started working on my ego and meditation you know the"},{"startMs":888480,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"ego isn't something that you can just uh get rid of or destroy immediately you have to start by"},{"startMs":895920,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"developing certain good habits being polite being good to others so that you start having a better"},{"startMs":903600,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"sense of self etc, so yeah that's my guess at the teaching and i suspect that there are deeper"},{"startMs":910480,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"symbolisms so if any of you have an interpretation of what this symbolic teaching meant i'd be"},{"startMs":916400,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"very grateful to have your insights too so please do comment below if you have any ideas"},{"startMs":922080,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"now what happened next i suspect happened differently for everyone else in the room"},{"startMs":929280,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"the priestess went back to the stage and she began to shapeshift"},{"startMs":933920,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"everyone must have seen a different thing because what i saw was quite personal to me"},{"startMs":939680,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"when i was younger maybe around eight years old i had an extremely vivid dream or nightmare should"},{"startMs":946480,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"i call it that has always stayed in the back of my mind my entire life, so in the dream as a child"},{"startMs":952800,"durationMs":9040,"subtitle":"i opened my bedroom door and a huge fat samurai in full black armor with a mask was stood there"},{"startMs":961840,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"it had this menacing and powerful presence, it gave me such a fright as a child and i ran from it"},{"startMs":969680,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"it didn't matter how far i ran every time i turned around to check if i lost it it was still there my"},{"startMs":976480,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"entire life i always wondered if it was a positive or negative being because even though i was scared"},{"startMs":983840,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"as a child it was actually quite a calm being which actually never attacked me or threatened"},{"startMs":990160,"durationMs":10560,"subtitle":"me in any way so here i am 20 years later in the astral watching on in awe at this priestess"},{"startMs":1001440,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"turning into this huge samurai being which was extremely similar to the samurai that was in"},{"startMs":1009040,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"my dreams as a child and what's more is that it somehow relates to her teaching about masks"},{"startMs":1015760,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"because the samurai was wearing a mask in my dream as a child and here, so i looked everywhere online"},{"startMs":1022880,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"for a picture to best show you what i mean by this samurai so i'll put that on the screen now"},{"startMs":1030480,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"this was really the most similar one i could find i don't know anything about samurais"},{"startMs":1036800,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"and i couldn't find much about them in terms of spirituality so if any of you have any knowledge"},{"startMs":1043120,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"or wisdom about the spiritual significance of samurais i'd be really grateful if you could share"},{"startMs":1048720,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"that with me in the comments below too, but yeah while watching this priestess i think i realized"},{"startMs":1055200,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"that perhaps this samurai wasn't actually a bad thing it was perhaps a sign in the future that"},{"startMs":1060960,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"i would take an interest in astral projection and the ego and things like that maybe i don't know"},{"startMs":1069120,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"you know i'm very much into the idea of us taking a spiritual warrior kind of attitude and approach"},{"startMs":1077120,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"towards astral projection because you need courage and willpower to do these sorts of practices to"},{"startMs":1085280,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"go into the astral to overcome yourself overcome your fears and desires so perhaps it's related to"},{"startMs":1091280,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"that i'm not sure so yeah i was pretty speechless at this point i didn't know what to make of what"},{"startMs":1098000,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"was happening and everyone else in the room was even more silent now too, nonetheless i liked her"},{"startMs":1105120,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"style of teaching she didn't just talk, and say words, she knew these people were not self-aware"},{"startMs":1114240,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"and so she did activities with them and showed them things in order to make impressions on their"},{"startMs":1121840,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"subconscious in hopes that it would, or should, affect their consciousness overall in some way"},{"startMs":1128560,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"so after she did this shapeshifting display someone knew came through"},{"startMs":1132800,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"the big doorway that i had entered through too and i was very surprised to see someone i knew"},{"startMs":1140080,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"and it was one of the least people i expected to be in a place like this, i didn't know her that"},{"startMs":1146480,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"well she was more of an acquaintance, an old colleague at a place i used to work at, uh so"},{"startMs":1153040,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"she came into the temple with this gleaming smile and happiness on her face that i had"},{"startMs":1158080,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"actually never seen before in the physical, keep in mind i worked with her for about three years..."},{"startMs":1165920,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"she started clapping her hands and shouting saying wow

too"},{"startMs":1177440,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"this is a woman in her 60s, i think, who barely expressed herself like this in the physical she's"},{"startMs":1185040,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"usually very dreary and sad you know i often felt sorry for her because there was always something"},{"startMs":1194160,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"she was upset about or involved with some drama and also the other colleagues were a bit mean to"},{"startMs":1200720,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"her people gossiped about her stuff like that so yeah i was happy to see her like this too"},{"startMs":1206720,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"but i was more surprised if anything, so as she's shouting celebrating with happiness the priestess"},{"startMs":1213920,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"walks over to her puts her arm around her shoulder
