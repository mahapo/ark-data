Practice the art of measurement\n02.  Don't be a victim\n03. Actively seek knowledge\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 3 ways on mastering self-discipline from Plato will add value to your life. \n\nPlato is one of the most famous philosophers of all time. He represented the philosophy of ancient Greece, belonging to its Classical Period. He was born into an aristocratic and influential family in Athens, where he founded the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the entire Western world. Along with his mentor Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is one of the most influential individuals in the entire history of humankind. It can even be said that he is one of the pillars of Western civilization. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism and his biggest contribution is the Theory of Forms or Doctrine of Ideas, which asserts that the physical world is not the real world. Instead, ultimate reality exists beyond our physical world, in the world of ideas. Plato was not only a prominent figure of philosophy, but also of religion and spirituality; so-called Neo-platonism deeply influenced Christian theology. Plato invented the written dialogue and dialectic form of philosophy. Some of his most famous books are The Republic, The Symposium, The Apology of Socrates, Allegory of the Cave and The Dialogues of Plato, in which the main character is Socrates, who influenced Plato’s philosophy to a great extent. His entire work has survived for more than 2,400 years and has remained very popular the entire time. Like his mentor, Plato was a practical philosopher and there are many life lessons to learn from his philosophy.\n\nResearch/Writing: Anastasiia Tarasova\n\nNarration/Audio Editing:\nDan Mellins-Cohen https://www.dmcvoiceovers.com \n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music:\nRoyalty Free - This Moment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ \n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBP5A6m2pE0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBP5A6m2pE0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBP5A6m2pE0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBP5A6m2pE0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eBP5A6m2pE0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eBP5A6m2pE0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9snwN8jZADm5uaTeKV0F_JGFSj0","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlA0VW50Y3dfbW53","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-12-24T15:00:31Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"5 Buddhist Ways Of Dealing With Difficult People (Buddhism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 5 buddhist ways of dealing with difficult people from the wisdom of  Buddha.

He’s also developed a system for musical tuning that’s still used today, has had an influence on the world of food science due to his theories on dietary restrictions, and was the very first person to divide the earth into five different climate zones. The man did everything!  While it would be a joy to talk about the life of such an impressive man, sadly there is almost nothing about his life that can be known for certain. None of his work and writings - not a single one - have been preserved. Instead, all we know from Pythagoras comes from texts written by Aristotle or Plato, who have both been influenced by this legendary ancient philosopher. But despite the little documentation, enough has been preserved to make Pythagoras the legendary figure that he is today - even without his books still with us, he’s influenced and helped evolve a few of the most important fields of human knowledge.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrK7m1EXxac/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrK7m1EXxac/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrK7m1EXxac/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrK7m1EXxac/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrK7m1EXxac/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":2,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RrK7m1EXxac"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"92Mm2Zq1dtETQTPpoz7eww0Uz2Y","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmFnRmhuZU95WGhJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-11-26T19:01:38Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"5 Ways To Develop A Strong Samurai Mindset - Miyamoto Musashi","description":"Exclusive!

Miyamoto Musashi is considered to be the greatest swordsman ever in the history of Japan, in large part due to his almost surreal discipline. \n\nSo here are 5 ways to  develop a strong samurai mindset from the philosophy of Miyamoto Musashi - \n01.

Embrace Adversity as Opportunity\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these insights form Miyamoto Musashi help you to develop a strong samurai mindset.\n\nA samurai at first, and then a Ronin, Miyamoto Musashi is considered to be the greatest swordsman ever in the history of Japan, in large part due to his almost surreal discipline. Indeed It is being said that he fought 60 duels, and never lost one. He fought for the first time when he was 13 against an experienced Samurai, and came out victorious. He took down the greatest swordsman at that time, one by one, until the throne was his, and his alone. However, Miyamoto was more than that. Not only was he a master of his craft, but he was also an artist, a cerebral philosopher and a buddhist. He sought meaning, wrote war and philosophy books, and his work became a blueprint for people who want to live a disciplined life. A week before he died in 1645, Miyamoto Musashi wrote 21 principles called “Dokkodo '' by which he expresses a stringent, honest, and ascetic or strongly self-disciplined view of life. \n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agFhneOyXhI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agFhneOyXhI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agFhneOyXhI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agFhneOyXhI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agFhneOyXhI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":3,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"agFhneOyXhI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"MSW2T4m0t858Xg5v8sLYwQbDKKk","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm9BbDFIdGVYcGFn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-11-12T19:11:26Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"5 Stoic Ways To Control Your Emotions  - Marcus Aurelius (Stoicism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to control your emotions from the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius.

He found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology and his philosophy is dubbed as “Jungian philosophy”.\n\nCarl Jung believed that true happiness comes when you understand and accept all aspects of who you are. To find happiness, you have to go on a journey to discover and accept yourself, including the parts you know and the ones you don't. It's like finding balance within yourself and knowing who you truly are. When you do this, you can find a deep and lasting happiness. \n\nSo here are 5 ways to be happy from the philosophy of Carl Jung.\n01. Focus on your mental Health\n02. Nurture Relationships \n03. Appreciate art and nature\n04. Set Professional Standards\n05. Seek higher guidance\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope that this wisdom on being happy from the philosophy of Carl Jung will be helpful in your life. \n\nCarl Jung, together with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences - in other words, to make the unconscious conscious. Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.\n\nResearch/Writing: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nKYc1AY_N0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nKYc1AY_N0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nKYc1AY_N0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nKYc1AY_N0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nKYc1AY_N0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":6,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9nKYc1AY_N0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"xW7EmaK7tbfGBkN4MzfvTckA2ag","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjVHTXFBbjR1Um04","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-09-24T20:50:35Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"5 Easy Ways To Move On In Your Life - Buddha (Buddism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to move on in life from the philosophy of the Buddha. Gautama Buddha was a philosopher, a spiritual leader and is credited as the founder of Buddhism.\n\nBuddha’s most essential teaching includes the Three Marks of Existence, which are as follows: \n01. Annica which means that life is in a constant flux, we have already made a video on this, the link for this is in the description.\n02. Dukkha which means that life is painful and causes suffering, and\n03. Anatta which means that the self is always changing\n\nAccording to Buddhism, our \"self\" is made up of five things, which they call \"The Five Aggregates of clinging.\" These are: \n01. Our physical body, our form, \n02. How we feel about things, our feelings, \n03. How we see and understand the world, our perception, \n04. Our consciousness, which is our awareness, and \n05. Our thoughts and emotions, our mental formations. \n\nBut none of these things on their own represent our true, unchanging self because they all change over time. So, \"anattā\" doesn't mean \"no self\" but rather \"no permanent self.\" It reminds us that nothing in life stays the same forever, including ourselves. Understanding this concept of \"non-self\" can help us let go of things and move on in life. It can make us feel free and independent. \nSo here are six ways that you can use the idea of \"non-self\" to help you move on in life from the wisdom of buddha - \n01. Live In The Present\n02. Embrace Change\n03. Be Grateful\n04. Increase Your Confidence\n05. Forgive\n06. Be Compassionate\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these lessons from Buddha will help you in moving on  in your life. \n\nThe Buddha was a philosopher, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who is credited as the founder of Buddhism.

Change your perspective about fear\n02. Overcome yourself\n03. Challenge herd mentality\n04. Embrace your fate \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope you find these insights from Nietzsche helpful in overcoming your fears.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n\nResearch/Writing: Oussama El Hajjami\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngh8jHqOB5c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngh8jHqOB5c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngh8jHqOB5c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngh8jHqOB5c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngh8jHqOB5c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ngh8jHqOB5c"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"O5EuGurDtcdQOjMvZYlNVUR4rYI","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmxHTC1LTzBhTGtn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-07-24T20:13:49Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Stoic Ways To Be Mentally Tough - Seneca (Stoicism)","description":"To try everything Brilliant has to offer—free—for a full 30 days, visit https://brilliant.org/PhilosophiesforLife/ .

He took down the greatest swordsman at that time, one by one, until the throne was his, and his alone. However, Miyamoto was more than that. Not only was he a master of his craft, but he was also an artist, a cerebral philosopher and a buddhist. He sought meaning, wrote war and philosophy books, and his work became a blueprint for people who want to live a disciplined life.

His philosophy is often referenced as Aristotelianism. \n\nAristotle extensively explored the art of persuasion and the principles underlying successful communication. He distilled his theories into three crucial components: logos, ethos, and pathos. These elements encompass logic, credibility, and emotion, respectively. According to Aristotle, effective communication requires a harmonious integration of these three modes of persuasion.Furthermore, Aristotle presented a model of communication that offers valuable insights into the communication process itself. Which is why in this video, we bring you five practical ways to communicate effectively, drawing inspiration from the timeless philosophy of Aristotle. ​​5 ways to communicate effectively from the philosophy of Aristotle are - \n01. Use Logical Arguments \n02. Establish Credibility\n03. Use Emotional Appeals \n04. Use Clear And Concise Language \n05. Practice Communicating \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these ​​5 ways to communicate effectively from the philosophy of Aristotle will add value to your life. \n\nAristotle is a Promethean figure in the history of the world, who lived between 384–322 BC, He is considered \"the father” of logic, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, of natural law, scientific method, rhetoric, psychology, realism and even of meteorology. He was first a student of Plato, then, when Plato retired, he left the Academia which Plato founded, and he became the tutor of Alexander The Great, and the two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Unfortunately, only a third of his magnificent work has survived. For example, the  treatises “Physics”, “Metaphysics”, “Nicomachean Ethics”, “Politics”, “On the Soul” and “Poetics”, have influenced more than two millennia of scientists and theologians alike, both fascinated by his ideas. \n\nResearch/Writing: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3_vl0_QYNk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3_vl0_QYNk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3_vl0_QYNk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3_vl0_QYNk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3_vl0_QYNk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":14,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"b3_vl0_QYNk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"8_57A107Z6M7ez7FrNV0Djmm-00","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlJNbzY1MFN1Mkdz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-29T18:14:53Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Enjoy Your Present Moment - Rumi (Sufism)","description":"In this video we bring you how to enjoy your present moment from the philosophy of Rumi. Rumi’s work, particularly his collection of mystical poetry known as the \"Masnavi”, have had a profound influence on literature, spirituality, and the understanding of the human experience.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 5 ways to enjoy your present moment from the philosophy of Rumi - \n01. Free yourself from the burdens of the past and the anxieties of the future\n02. Quiet your mind\n03. Embrace the beauty of the present moment\n04. Be fully engaged in your life’s experiences\n05. Cultivate gratitude\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 5 ways to enjoy your present moment from the philosophy of Rumi  will add value to your life. \n \nSufism began some 9 centuries ago and is focused on reaching the divine - the power that created the skies, the earth, us and life as a whole, through love. It means that in Sufism, we human beings are lovers, the divine is beloved and to love the divine, we need to connect back to the essence of life and understand that we and the world are one. Sufism has given the world some of its brightest minds and poets and one of those people is known as Maulana, Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī, arguably the best Sufi poet in history. Rumi, a Persian scholar at first, then a Mystic, has written many illustrious poems depicting love and its central role as the bridge to reach the divine; poems that are engraved in the literature books for eternity. His brilliance caught the eyes of people since his childhood. His father, a famous scholar back then, had personally taken the responsibility of teaching him. He deepened his knowledge at a very young age and after the death of his father, he was destined to succeed him as a scholar. But Rumi wanted to learn more, so he connected with another brilliant teacher named Al Tarmithi and a few years later, his teacher left him because he considered that he had nothing left to teach his student, Rumi was now a complete scholar. Rumi was adored by his followers and when he held assemblies, he had a large crowd as attendees. However, life and the divine had other plans for him. In 1244, Rumi encountered Shams Tabrizi, a traveling Sufi dervish who changed his core understanding of life. Rumi became so fond of Shams that he neglected his students and his family and spent days and nights with him, all to grasp the essence of pure love and how to express it to reach the divine. Rumi turned from a Scholar to a Sufi poet who sang for love, danced in circles, which is now called Sufi whirling or the whirling dervish, and wrote poems that are still relevant today continuing to have a deep influence. \n\nResearch/Writing: Oussama El Hajjami\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMo650Su2Gs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMo650Su2Gs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMo650Su2Gs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMo650Su2Gs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMo650Su2Gs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":15,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RMo650Su2Gs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"5_iV9ArSD29YHrJ9bnmivfqjj1U","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm9ITGJXd1FlLWtR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-15T21:56:50Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"4 Ways to Triumph Over Your Anxiety - Soren Kierkegaard (Existentialism)","description":"In this video, we bring you 4 ways to manage your anxiety from the wisdom of Soren Kierkegaard.

He has published a fair amount of works in his lifetime, most written under various pseudonyms. These pseudonyms expressed all kinds of different, sometimes even contradicting, views that have caused historians trying to find Kierkegaard’s true beliefs to scratch their heads. Some of his pseudonyms were: Johannes Climacus, Anti-Climacus, Constantin Constantius, and ‘The Individual.’ Some of his most notable works are: ‘Either/or’, ‘Fear and Trembling’, ‘Sickness unto Death’, and ‘The Concept of Anxiety’. Kierkegaard is widely regarded as the father of Existentialism, a theory asserting that human beings possess no innate essence or fixed purpose and are free to determine their identity. Kierkegaard wrote extensively on this subject, although never using the term ‘existentialism’ himself. \n\nResearch/Writing: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHLbWwQe-kQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHLbWwQe-kQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHLbWwQe-kQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHLbWwQe-kQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHLbWwQe-kQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":16,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oHLbWwQe-kQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qzjol7u032mx7zYCAArVQVfvPdc","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkRYVGU1TGVwQ1NJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-01T19:37:29Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Ways to Make Everyday Your Best Day - Marcus Aurelius’ Daily Routine (Stoicism)","description":"In this video, we will discuss six ways to make everyday your best day by following the routine of Marcus Aurelius.

Indeed It is being said that he fought 60 duels, and never lost one. He fought for the first time when he was 13 against an experienced Samurai, and came out victorious. He took down the greatest swordsman at that time, one by one, until the throne was his, and his alone. However, Miyamoto was more than that. Not only was he a master of his craft, but he was also an artist, a cerebral philosopher and a buddhist. He sought meaning, wrote war and philosophy books, and his work became a blueprint for people who want to live a disciplined life. A week before he died in 1645, Miyamoto Musashi wrote 21 principles called “Dokkodo '' by which he expresses a stringent, honest, and ascetic or strongly self-disciplined view of life. \n\nResearch/Writing: Oussama El Hajjami\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCK1g3nYbM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCK1g3nYbM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCK1g3nYbM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCK1g3nYbM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCK1g3nYbM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":18,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wvCK1g3nYbM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fxNjnqJRfy7OoGzbnQTcJD2IWNs","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmpERlRKTzZET3lV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-27T20:00:11Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Ways To Avoid Boredom - Arthur Schopenhauer (Philosophical Pessimism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 6 ways to avoid boredom from the wisdom of Arthur Schopenhauer. He is mostly known for his famous book “The World as Will and Representation”. He is known as the ultimate pessimist and his idea reflects philosophical pessimism.\n\nSo here are 6 ways to avoid boredom from the wisdom of Arthur Schopenhauer - \n01. Appreciate the beauty of everyday life\n02. Focus on the present moment\n03. Learn something new\n04. Cultivate your interests \n05. Focus on your health  \n06. Embrace solitude \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 6 ways to avoid boredom from the wisdom of Arthur Schopenhauer will add value to your life.  \n\nArthur Schopenhauer was one of the greatest philosophers of all time. He lived from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 19th century in Germany. His most important work was “The World As Will and Representation”. He was one of the most prominent figures of the philosophy of pessimism and the first great Western philosopher who was interested in Buddhism. The best way to understand his teachings is to analyze them through the eyes of the enlightened pessimism prevalent in Buddhist philosophy. Arthur Schopenhauer is known as the ultimate pessimist because he articulates a pessimistic worldview that questions life’s meaning. He believed that the universe was fundamentally irrational and human beings are driven by a force called the Will, a basic force in the Universe, never satisfied, and we, the human beings, don’t have much self-control to fight it. Schopenhauer argues that the best way to be happy is by ceasing to look for happiness and instead try to remove the unhappiness from our life. This idea reflects philosophical pessimism, which is not a psychological disposition, but rather a worldview. Philosophical pessimism suggests that it is always better to expect the worst in order to receive the best. By using the principles of philosophical pessimism, we can eliminate the irrational hopes and expectations we have in life and thus we can live more peacefully and happily.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Momenthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDFTJO6DOyU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDFTJO6DOyU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDFTJO6DOyU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDFTJO6DOyU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDFTJO6DOyU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":19,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jDFTJO6DOyU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6cOYzxkYcUsdT28fCV_ET2zrTvI","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkluQ2JPTHRjSEpZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-14T20:00:10Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Stoic Ways To Keep Your Calm - Seneca (Stoicism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 6 ways to keep your calm from the wisdom of Seneca.

Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of “absurd” or “absurdism\". \n\nHere are 6 ways you can enjoy your life from the philosophy of Albert Camus- \n01. Embrace absurdism\n02. Embrace the present moment\n03. Cultivate passions and hobbies\n04. Choose love\n05. Travel\n06. Connect with others \nI hope you enjoyed watching these 6 ways you can enjoy your from the philosophy of Albert Camus and find them helpful in your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9xple1n-c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9xple1n-c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9xple1n-c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9xple1n-c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sp9xple1n-c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":21,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Sp9xple1n-c"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"R2PZ6e9t3jM14K6tYt3l4Y89_pk","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLnpmeTZZcE91UXdF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-15T19:26:20Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Stay Calm - Lao Tzu (Taoism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to stay calm from the wisdom of Lao Tzu.

Even though it is over 2000 years old, more and more people are discovering how Stoicism is not only relevant to modern times, but can be applied in very simple, yet strong ways. \n\nResearch/Writing: Oussama El Hajjami\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucRjIBhbJt0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucRjIBhbJt0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucRjIBhbJt0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucRjIBhbJt0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ucRjIBhbJt0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ucRjIBhbJt0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"lYiX7k15hLRdbaPIqiYSUJ44TKI","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm5IbjNFZ3hMaVl3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-27T22:31:40Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Own Yourself - Carl Jung (Jungian Philosophy)","description":"Carl Jung - How To Own Yourself (Jungian Philosophy)\nSkip the waitlist and invest in blue-chip art for the very first time by signing up for Masterworks: https://masterworks.art/philosophies\nPurchase shares in great masterpieces from artists like Pablo Picasso, Banksy, Andy Warhol, and more. 🎨 See important Masterworks disclosures: http://masterworks.io/cd\n\nIn this video we will be talking about how to own yourself from the philosophy of Carl Jung. He found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology and his philosophy is dubbed as “Jungian philosophy”. Within the field of psychology, Jung is famously known for introducing the terms ‘introvert’ and ‘extravert,’ introducing archetypes of the psyche and classifying the boundary between the unconscious and conscious. Our consciousness includes everything that we know about ourselves; the unconsciousness entails everything that is part of us but that we are not aware of. Jung introduced ‘the ego’ and ‘the persona’ as our consciousness, and ‘the shadow’ and ‘the animus and anima’ as the parts that make up our unconsciousness. The shadow is one of the toughest, most intimidating parts to handle: it exists out of everything about ourselves that we dislike, which is why we often refuse to acknowledge it as a part of us. However, what many people don’t know is that not facing the shadow can be an even more intense blow on your self-esteem. But facing it is actually the only way to gain true control over yourself and who you are.  \n\nWhich is why in this video, we will teach you how you can truly own yourself by doing so-called shadow work in 3 easy steps, from the philosophy of Carl Jung. \nStep 1 - Meet Your Shadow \nStep 2 - Accept Your Shadow \nStep 3 - Integrate Your Shadow \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope that this wisdom on owning yourself from the philosophy of Carl Jung will be  helpful in your life. \n\nCarl Jung, together with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences - in other words, to make the unconscious conscious. Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.\n\nResearch/Writing: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHn3EgxLiYw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHn3EgxLiYw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHn3EgxLiYw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHn3EgxLiYw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHn3EgxLiYw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":25,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nHn3EgxLiYw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"z9Mosc8N2R6_1fyacH1xIW5Rupo","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLld2TGI5aXlHVDJ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-13T20:00:10Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Let Go - Lao Tzu (Taoism)","description":"Thank you to Wondrium for sponsoring today's video!

Live with integrity and preserve your honor\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope you find these insights form  Miyamoto Musashi very helpful for your self discipline. \n\nA samurai at first, and then a Ronin, Miyamoto Musashi is considered to be the greatest swordsman ever in the history of Japan, in large part due to his almost surreal discipline. Indeed It is being said that he fought 60 duels, and never lost one. He fought for the first time when he was 13 against an experienced Samurai, and came out victorious. He took down the greatest swordsman at that time, one by one, until the throne was his, and his alone. However, Miyamoto was more than that. Not only was he a master of his craft, but he was also an artist, a cerebral philosopher and a buddhist. He sought meaning, wrote war and philosophy books, and his work became a blueprint for people who want to live a disciplined life. A week before he died in 1645, Miyamoto Musashi wrote 21 principles called “Dokkodo '' by which he expresses a stringent, honest, and ascetic or strongly self-disciplined view of life. \n\nResearch/Writing: Oussama El Hajjami\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvKz8Pi0kQo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvKz8Pi0kQo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvKz8Pi0kQo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvKz8Pi0kQo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvKz8Pi0kQo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":27,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cvKz8Pi0kQo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WsaKU9uLPaSm3Ncfy_g9e7rgUsg","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLl9IVDg5WWtkMGRN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-17T23:36:10Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How to be Genuinely Authentic - Carl Jung (Jungian Philosophy)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to be authentic from the philosophy of Carl Jung.

Fyodor Dostoevsky was a 19th century novelist and philosopher and is considered to be one of the first writers to incorporate concepts of what we now know as existentialism.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 10 life lessons from the philosophy of Fyodor Dostoevsky - \n01. Excessive self-pride leads to isolation\n02. Be better for yourself, not for other people\n03. It’s more important to live life, than to think about life\n04. Emotional intelligence is as insightful as rationality\n05. Love life more than its meaning\n06. Be virtuous and just\n07. Fight evil with love and compassion\n08. Moral freedom is no freedom at all\n09. Compassion and love can break alienation\n10. Learn to enjoy suffering\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 10 life lessons from the philosophy of Fyodor Dostoevsky will add value to your life. \n\nFyodor Dostoevsky was a 19th century novelist and philosopher, considered by many to be one of the most influential authors in all of world literature. Born and raised in Tsarist Russia, Dostoevsky was heavily exposed to the misery and injustice characteristic of his time. Among his more marking experiences, he spent four years in a Siberian labour camp, went through compulsory military service in exile, and had to beg for money while in Western Europe due to his gambling addiction. And yet, despite his first-hand experience of misery and suffering, Dostoevsky remained hopeful and optimistic about what life is. He is considered to be one of the first writers to incorporate concepts of what we now know as existentialism. Dostoevsky’s works revolve around a few major themes like the meaning of life, the constancy of suffering, the divide between rationality and emotion, spirituality, and the various sides of the human condition.  Some of his well known novels and essays are Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot, and Notes from the Underground. Through his novels and essays, Dostoevsky tried to make sense of the suffering and misery around him, attempting to find meaning and hope even in the bleakest of times. His work represents a deep dive into human suffering, the evil surrounding us, and the problems caused by moral corruption and in each of the universes he created, he gave ways to escape the apparent  constant suffering and torment of his characters through moral virtue, love, compassion, and one’s own sense of meaning. His writings were heavily influential for the existentialist current of philosophy, representing sources of inspiration for other consecrated authors like Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iy58WTBfrPE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iy58WTBfrPE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iy58WTBfrPE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iy58WTBfrPE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iy58WTBfrPE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":29,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Iy58WTBfrPE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6BVjoZ4kKdYQz20FCGR0ngsdFIY","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlNVc0dtWnQ2RjFF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-18T23:00:20Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"4 Ways To Have A Healthy Relationship - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"In this video we will talk about 4 ways to Have a healthy relationship from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUsGmZt6F1E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUsGmZt6F1E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUsGmZt6F1E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUsGmZt6F1E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUsGmZt6F1E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":30,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SUsGmZt6F1E"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"VlIsV6BQ07-wUbcf38H0g2DNym0","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlAyQTYyaTE4Z25J","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-26T20:20:24Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"4 Ways To Simplify Your Life - Loa Tzu (Taoism)","description":"Lao Tzu - How To Simplify Your Life (Taoism)\nClick on https://masterworks.art/philosophiesforlife to skip the waitlist and invest in blue-chip art for the very first time by signing up for Masterworks.\nPurchase shares in great masterpieces from artists like Pablo Picasso, Banksy, Andy Warhol, and more. 🎨 See important Masterworks disclosures: https://www.masterworks.io/about/disclaimer\n\nIn this video we will be talking about 4 ways to simplify your life  from the philosophy of Lao Tzu.

Alongside his notion of Bad Faith, Sartre has discussed many aspects of existentialism and ideas on human life that are extremely helpful.\n\nSo with that in mind, in this video we bring you 8 important life lessons derived from the works of Sartre. \n01. Dare to act\n02. Face your freedom\n03. Take responsibility \n04. Set an example\n05. Embrace your fears\n06. Don’t let others define you\n07. Don't follow a doctrine \n08. Embrace your nothingness \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 8 Life Lessons From Sartre will add value to your life. \n\nJean-Paul Sartre was a French playwright, screenwriter, political activist, literary critic, and one of the leading philosophers who followed the philosophy of Existentialism: the philosophy that says that humans are born a blank slate and are free to determine their own identity, behavior and goals. Sartre was born in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century and when he was around sixty years old, he was awarded the1964 Nobel Prize in Literature. He however refused the prize, claiming that “a writer should never allow himself to become an institution.” Sartre wrote many fictional and non-fictional books, essays and gave lectures on Existentialism. Some of his noted works are: Nausea, Being and Nothingness, Existentialism is a Humanism, and No Exit. \n\nResearch/Writing: Lisa Hentschke\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXSp77x0vYA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXSp77x0vYA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXSp77x0vYA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXSp77x0vYA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXSp77x0vYA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":32,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xXSp77x0vYA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vohUCXfUbGmBBh_Yhv4ulAuI6NI","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkFuTDhlZW4wWURv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-29T21:33:45Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"5 Buddhist Ways Of Living A Good Life - Buddha (Buddhism)","description":"Get Exclusive NordVPN deal here ➼ https://nordvpn.com/philosophiesforlife.

These five precepts of Buddhism can be seen as a representation of Buddhist values and principles. They have a lot of depth, and involve renouncing some behaviours, while developing other, more wholesome qualities. Hence following these precepts helps us build our moral character, and by developing our moral character we accumulate good karma and as such are able to live a good life. The teachings of Buddha have always had a huge influence not only in Asia, but around the world, which is why in this video we take a look at how to live a good life, according to the 5 precepts from the philosophy of the Buddha. \n \nThe 5 ways to live a good life following  the 5 precepts from the philosophy of the Buddha are - \n01. Abstain from Killing\n02. Abstain from Stealing\n03. Abstain from Sexual Misconduct\n04. Abstain from Wrong Speech\n05. Refrain from taking intoxicant\nWe hope that these 5 ways to live a good life following the 5 precepts from the philosophy of the Buddha will add value to your life. \n \nThe Buddha was a philosopher, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who is credited as the founder of Buddhism. He was born as Siddhartha Gautama in India in 566 BC into an aristocratic family and when he was twenty-nine years old, he left the comforts of his home to seek the meaning of the suffering he saw around him. After six years of arduous yogic training, he abandoned the way of self-mortification and instead sat in mindful meditation beneath a bodhi tree. On the full moon of May, with the rising of the morning star, Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha, the awakened one. The Buddha wandered the plains of northeastern India for 45 years more, teaching the path or Dharma he had realised in that moment. Around him developed a community of people, drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing this path. Nowadays, he is worshiped by most Buddhist schools as the enlightened one who has escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth, transcending Karma. Their main teachings focus on their insight into duhkha meaning “suffering” and into Nirvana, which means the end of suffering. \n\nArticles sourced - \nhttps://buddho.org/buddhism-and-morality-the-five-precepts/\nhttps://www.lotussculpture.com/blog/the-five-precepts-of-the-buddha/\nhttps://philarchive.org/archive/SHOTHA-2\nhttps://tricycle.org/magazine/the-five-precepts/\n \nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnL8een0YDo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnL8een0YDo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnL8een0YDo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnL8een0YDo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnL8een0YDo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":33,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"AnL8een0YDo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mPWb78bi2AEmHBSgCTb1ay21Hs4","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm9jU0N1MHBxMXRZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-15T23:47:53Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"7 Life Lessons From Rumi (Sufism)","description":"In this video we bring you 7 life lessons from the philosophy of Rumi. Rumi, arguably the best Sufi poet in history, has written many illustrious poems depicting love. His poems are engraved in the literature books for eternity. \n\nSo with that in mind, here are 7 important life lessons we can learn from Rumi - \n01. There is something you can do better than anyone else\n02. You don’t have to see the whole staircase\n03. The wound is the place where the light enters you\n04. The gold mine lies within you\n05. Love is within you\n06. Let go of judgment \n07. Change yourself to change the world \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 7 Life Lessons From Rumi will add value to your life. \n \nSufism began some 9 centuries ago and is focused on reaching the divine - the power that created the skies, the earth, us and life as a whole, through love. It means that in Sufism, we human beings are lovers, the divine is beloved and to love the divine, we need to connect back to the essence of life and understand that we and the world are one. Sufism has given the world some of its brightest minds and poets and one of those people is known as Maulana, Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī, arguably the best Sufi poet in history. Rumi, a Persian scholar at first, then a Mystic, has written many illustrious poems depicting love and its central role as the bridge to reach the divine; poems that are engraved in the literature books for eternity. His brilliance caught the eyes of people since his childhood. His father, a famous scholar back then, had personally taken the responsibility of teaching him. He deepened his knowledge at a very young age and after the death of his father, he was destined to succeed him as a scholar. But Rumi wanted to learn more, so he connected with another brilliant teacher named Al Tarmithi and a few years later, his teacher left him because he considered that he had nothing left to teach his student, Rumi was now a complete scholar. Rumi was adored by his followers and when he held assemblies, he had a large crowd as attendees. However, life and the divine had other plans for him. In 1244, Rumi encountered Shams Tabrizi, a traveling Sufi dervish who changed his core understanding of life. Rumi became so fond of Shams that he neglected his students and his family and spent days and nights with him, all to grasp the essence of pure love and how to express it to reach the divine. Rumi turned from a Scholar to a Sufi poet who sang for love, danced in circles, which is now called Sufi whirling or the whirling dervish, and wrote poems that are still relevant today continuing to have a deep influence. \n \nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocSCu0pq1tY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocSCu0pq1tY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocSCu0pq1tY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocSCu0pq1tY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocSCu0pq1tY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":34,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ocSCu0pq1tY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"u6cEnvhAaxaxLy3Ap28CNz13_LE","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkgtX2NqUThUMUJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-01T00:00:10Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Ways To Be In Flow With Your Life  - Lao Tzu(Taoism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 6 ways to be in flow with your life  from the philosophy of Lao Tzu.

He found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology and his philosophy is dubbed as “Jungian philosophy”.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 7 ways to know yourself better from Carl Jung - \n01. Draw Mandalas \n02. Understand your subconscious impulses \n03. Know your fears\n04. Face your emotions \n05. Understand your dreams \n06. Take time to be alone \n07. Ask others what they think about you \nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 7 ways philosophy from the philosophy of  Carl Jung will help you in knowing yourself better.\n\nCarl Jung, together with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences - in other words, to make the unconscious conscious. Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DM4bxUmPCI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DM4bxUmPCI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DM4bxUmPCI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DM4bxUmPCI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DM4bxUmPCI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6DM4bxUmPCI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ShVSkFNvXWLliHYAc8ncbSzIj7g","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm9qWElfQ2k0TGFB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-26T21:00:16Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Live Freely In This Meaningless World - Albert Camus (Philosophy Of Absurdism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to be free from the philosophy of Albert Camus. Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism\". \n\nThe main theory of Camus is to embrace the absurdity of life as a simple fact, without falling into despair. This ability to embrace absurdity means to be free. According to Camus, there are 2 types of freedom: Common Freedom, defined as the ability to choose between different options - for example, whether to take a glass of water from the table or not -  and Absurd Freedom, the ability to live a life without meaning. For Camus, Absurd Freedom is true freedom. In a world without meaning, individuals can discover that they can do whatever they want, while still taking full responsibility for their actions. \n\nWithout any legitimate pressure from other people, society and so on, we can learn to only follow our inner motivations and personal values. Reaffirming this power coming from such an inner freedom, we as individuals thus create our own meaning of life.\n\nSo to help you understand how to be more free, we bring you 7 ways to live freely from the philosophy of Albert Camus:\n01. Believe in freedom \n02. Fight for freedom \n03. Be creative\n04. Act rebellious \n05. Be free but lawful\n06. Acknowledge the negative sides of your freedom\n07. Use your freedom to improve yourself\nI hope you enjoyed watching these 7 ways you can be free from the philosophy of Albert Camus and find them helpful in your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojXI_Ci4LaA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojXI_Ci4LaA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojXI_Ci4LaA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojXI_Ci4LaA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojXI_Ci4LaA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":37,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ojXI_Ci4LaA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"bZ9uBc8W5PsL6S5bALEVlnwnyvk","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmNjMlVKTkUtOEs0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-12T21:08:49Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"​How To Develop A Virtuous Character - Aristotle (Aristotelianism)","description":"In this video we bring you ​​how to develop a virtuous character from the philosophy of Aristotle. His philosophy is often referenced as Aristotelianism. \n\nAristotle defined virtues as dispositions to choose good actions and passions, informed by moral knowledge of several sorts. For Aristotle, virtues can be intellectual or moral, the intellectual ones are learned by instruction or education, the moral ones are developed by habits. Performing virtuous acts can be motivated by having a practical purpose or by the desire to act in a virtuous way or by both. In this video, we will explore what one might need to develop virtuous character in accordance with Aristotle’s Virtue Ethics Theory. The three ways to develop your character are - \n01. Adopt a Virtuous Mindset\n02. Practice Practical Wisdom \n03. Contemplate and Reflect\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these three ways to develop your character from the philosophy of Aristotle will add value to your life. \n\nAristotle is a Promethean figure in the history of the world, who lived between 384–322 BC, He is considered \"the father” of logic, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, of natural law, scientific method, rhetoric, psychology, realism and even of meteorology. He was first a student of Plato, then, when Plato retired, he left the Academia which Plato founded, and he became the tutor of Alexander The Great, and the two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Unfortunately, only a third of his magnificent work has survived. For example, the  treatises “Physics”, “Metaphysics”, “Nicomachean Ethics”, “Politics”, “On the Soul” and “Poetics”, have influenced more than two millennia of scientists and theologians alike, both fascinated by his ideas. \n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cc2UJNE-8K4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cc2UJNE-8K4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cc2UJNE-8K4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cc2UJNE-8K4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cc2UJNE-8K4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":38,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cc2UJNE-8K4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Y42wHMA9BGn8okkaSc9xVLZ-ybA","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkQ5OU82enpjeDRn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-29T15:00:10Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Master Self Control - Socrates (Socratic Skepticism)","description":"🌏 Get Exclusive NordVPN deal here ➼ https://nordvpn.com/philosophiesforlife.

To achieve self control, people must be free from their appetites for bodily pleasures, like food, drink, sex and other physical comforts. For example, Socrates was  famous for going barefoot and dressing as simply as possible, managing to control his own passions, desires, and appetites. His asceticism - or severe self-discipline - is difficult to follow in our modern lives as for many of us such a lifestyle is neither practical nor desirable.  \n\nIn spite of this, he can still teach us to enhance our self-control, and to help you better understand his teachings regarding the mastery of self-control and how best to implement them into your own life, here are 3 lessons from the wisdom of Socrates:\n01. Be in control of your bodily desires\n02. Be Just\n03. Know yourself\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 3 ways to master self-control will add value to your life. \n\nSocrates lived between 469 and 399 B.C.E. and he is one of the most famous philosophers in the entire history of humankind. He is sometimes considered as the founder of the Western philosophy and his work reflects the philosophy of Skepticism, which has as its main base that knowledge can be obtained through systematic doubt and continual testing. Although Socrates hasn't written anything, he has forever changed philosophy itself. Most of the things we know today about his philosophy came from Plato, Aristophanes and Xenophon whose writings are in the form of dialogues between Socrates and other Athenians. These writings gave birth to a new literary genre called the Socratic dialogue. Unfortunately, he is also famous for his tragic life. In 399 BCE, he was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and of failing to acknowledge the city's official gods. After a trial that lasted just a single day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing to escape. The way his life ended can be considered as the founding myth of philosophy as a discipline. For one to really practice philosophy, they have to go against societal norms, to question everything even at the risk of their own peril. Everything about Socrates was impressive: his appearance, personality, and behaviour, as well as in his views and methods. And this made many of the people around him to write about him, including Plato. It is unfortunate that Socrates did not write at all and all we have is indirect evidence. Also, it is said that each age produces a Socrates of its own, however there are some core fundamental teachings of the original Socrates that transcend the centuries.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D99O6zzcx4g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D99O6zzcx4g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D99O6zzcx4g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D99O6zzcx4g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D99O6zzcx4g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":39,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"D99O6zzcx4g"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"TllwM1QoZ5rw8FxPrCzWLbzp2k4","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmtFQUtDOU44eUFN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-17T00:00:12Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Live A Good Life - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"In this video we will talk about how to live a good life from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the main precursors of existentialism and emphasised on the importance of putting our will in the actions we take in life and how to make the best out of it.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher who lived in the second half of the 19th century. \nHe was physically sick most of his life and spent his last years almost unconscious due to a mental breakdown. In spite of this, he gave great insights into the world of human psychology, including what it means to live a ‘good life’. For him, a good life does not mean comfort and pleasure, it means mainly a life in which you live authentically and freely, following your own values and aspirations. To help you understand how to live a good life, here are 9 lessons we can learn from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche: \n01. Focus on real life\n02. Live a meaningful life\n03. Follow your own life goals\n04. Keep your mind open\n05. Take care of your body\n06. Embrace your “evil” qualities\n07. Consume art\n08. Cultivate friendship especially in romantic relationships\n09. Be patient with your self-growth\nWe hope you enjoyed watching these 9 ways on living a good life from the philosophy of  Friedrich and hope this video helps you live a good life. \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n \nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEAKC9N8yAM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEAKC9N8yAM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEAKC9N8yAM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEAKC9N8yAM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEAKC9N8yAM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":40,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kEAKC9N8yAM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ja9LgmTLTj_dfBDRJqeLsoDtQeI","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLnRaVTBNLXYwdzRF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-04-27T22:13:01Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Become Psychologically Mature - Carl Jung (Jungian Philosophy)","description":"Become smarter in 5 minutes by signing up to Morning Brew for free today: https://morningbrewdaily.com/philosophiesforlife\nCarl Jung - How To Become Psychologically Mature (Jungian Philosophy)\n\nIn this video we will be talking about how to become psychologically mature from the philosophy of Carl Jung. Although Carl Jung’s work does not reflect a systematic philosophy, his contribution to the realm of philosophy is significant and often referred to as “Jungian philosophy”. Becoming psychologically mature does not happen overnight, it is a long process which takes place over a lifetime, and you need to go through the 4 stages. To help you navigate them smoothly and avoid the pitfalls in the way of becoming psychologically mature, in this video we will talk about the 4 stages of life in detail and how you can make the most of them in order to reach the highest levels of maturity according to the philosophy of Carl Jung. The four stages to become psychologically mature are - \n01. The Athlete Stage\n02. The Warrior Stage\n03. The Statement Stage\n04. The Spirit Stage\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these lessons on how to become psychologically mature from the philosophy of Carl Jung will add value to your life. \n\nCarl Jung, together with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences - in other words, to make the unconscious conscious. Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZU0M-v0w4E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZU0M-v0w4E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZU0M-v0w4E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZU0M-v0w4E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZU0M-v0w4E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":41,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tZU0M-v0w4E"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"D4L7v-vkB_8eLpTfcCHm_ut_-Bs","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLk92TC1VWmFCbFVz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-04-15T22:30:01Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"​​How To Improve Your Self Discipline - Aristotle (Aristotelianism)","description":"In this video we bring you 5 ways to improve and manage your self discipline from the philosophy of Aristotle.

To help you learn ways to improve and manage your self discipline, today we’re bringing you 5 relevant teachings from the philosophy of Aristotle: \n01. Believe you have free will \n02.

He was first a student of Plato, then, when Plato retired, he left the Academia which Plato founded, and he became the tutor of Alexander The Great, and the two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Unfortunately, only a third of his magnificent work has survived. For example, the  treatises “Physics”, “Metaphysics”, “Nicomachean Ethics”, “Politics”, “On the Soul” and “Poetics”, have influenced more than two millennia of scientists and theologians alike, both fascinated by his ideas. \n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvL-UZaBlUs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvL-UZaBlUs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvL-UZaBlUs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvL-UZaBlUs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OvL-UZaBlUs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":42,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OvL-UZaBlUs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"pZnqTffnCYcGxo5O2apkAjRTzTk","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLnp0bVg3aktjTU5J","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-03-30T22:00:20Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Take Control Of Your Life - Plato (Platonic Idealism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to take control of your life from the philosophy of Plato.

He represented the philosophy of ancient Greece, belonging to its Classical Period. He was born into an aristocratic and influential family in Athens, where he founded the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the entire Western world. Along with his mentor Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is one of the most influential individuals in the entire history of humankind. It can even be said that he is one of the pillars of Western civilisation. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism and his biggest contribution is the Theory of Forms or Doctrine of Ideas, which asserts that the physical world is not the real world. Instead, ultimate reality exists beyond our physical world, in the world of ideas. Plato was not only a prominent figure of philosophy, but also of religion and spirituality; so-called Neo-platonism deeply influenced Christian theology. Plato invented the written dialogue and dialectic form of philosophy. Some of his most famous books are The Republic, The Symposium, The Apology of Socrates, Allegory of the Cave and The Dialogues of Plato, in which the main character is Socrates, who influenced Plato’s philosophy to a great extent. His entire work has survived for more than 2,400 years and has remained very popular the entire time. Like his mentor, Plato was a practical philosopher and there are many life lessons to learn from his philosophy.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmX7jKcMNI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmX7jKcMNI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmX7jKcMNI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmX7jKcMNI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmX7jKcMNI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":43,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ztmX7jKcMNI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"XTcVU0MPDDG5AcX7jgSosewhV3A","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLi04V2VrWjZELXFN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-03-13T22:00:00Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Realize Your True Potential In Life - Carl Jung (Jungian Philosophy)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to realize your true potential in life from the philosophy of Carl Jung.

Gautama Buddha was a philosopher, a spiritual leader and is credited as the founder of Buddhism.\n \nThe teachings of Buddha revolve around Duhkha, which means suffering, and the end of Duhkha, which is regarded as the state of Nirvana.  The philosophy’s most essential teaching includes the Three Marks of Existence, which are as follows: \n01. Annica which means that life is in a constant flux, we have already made a video on this, the link for this is in the description.\n02. Duhkha which means that life is painful and causes suffering, and\n03. Anatta which means that the self is always changing\n\nAfter the Buddha gained enlightenment, he traveled to Sarnath in the present-day district of Varanasi, where he met with five monks, he previously practiced with and gave his first sermon, the four noble truths. These four Noble Truths are the foundational tenets of Buddhism, which spark awareness of suffering as the nature of existence, its cause, and how to live without it. In this video we are going to talk about dukha, the second mark of existence, to better understand the suffering that we all go through and how we can use these 4 noble truths to deal with suffering in our modern day life.\n\nThe four noble truths  are as follows - \n01. The truth of Dukha \n02. The truth of Samudaya\n03. The Truth of Nirodha\n04. The truth of Magga\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these lessons from Buddha will help you in dealing with changes in your life. \n\nThe Buddha was a philosopher, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who is credited as the founder of Buddhism. He was born as Siddhartha Gautama in India in 566 BC into an aristocratic family and when he was twenty-nine years old, he left the comforts of his home to seek the meaning of the suffering he saw around him. After six years of arduous yogic training, he abandoned the way of self-mortification and instead sat in mindful meditation beneath a bodhi tree. On the full moon of May, with the rising of the morning star, Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha, the awakened one. The Buddha wandered the plains of northeastern India for 45 years more, teaching the path or Dharma he had realized in that moment. Around him developed a community of people, drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing this path. Nowadays, he is worshiped by most Buddhist schools as the enlightened one who has escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth, transcending Karma. Their main teachings focus on their insight into duhkha meaning “suffering” and into Nirvana, which means the end of suffering. \n\nVideos on Annica\nBuddha - How To Deal With Changes In Life (Buddhism)\nhttps://youtu.be/Gzs6s_SGmng\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3R0O_majlQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3R0O_majlQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3R0O_majlQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3R0O_majlQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I3R0O_majlQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":46,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"I3R0O_majlQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"FpdDtC0B7UMUx8p0PK9t3qejSSo","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmlacmJQQzNaMUtn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-01-31T22:00:12Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Live A Fulfilling Life - Plato (Platonic Idealism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to have a fulfilling life from the philosophy of Plato. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism. For Plato, one of the main purposes of learning philosophy is to enable one to live a fulfilled life. \n\nThe state of fulfilment or well being was named by the ancient Greek philosophers as eudaimonia. For Plato, eudaimonia is strongly related to virtue. Plato’s main ethical view is that the unjust man's soul, without virtue, is chaotic and at war with itself. Even if we satisfy all our desires and wishes, if we are not in harmony with ourselves and with the community of people around us, we cannot achieve eudaimonia. \n\nTo help you better understand what Plato believed defined a fulfilled life and how can we achieve eudaimonia, here are 9 lessons from the philosophy of Plato:\n01. Educate yourself\n02. Have an active life\n03. Avoid anger at all costs\n04. Be content with little\n05. Live honorably\n06. Be in charge of your own happiness\n07. Find inspiration in music\n08. Find your soulmate\n09. Care about the happiness of others\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 9 ways from the philosophy of Plato, adds value to your life and helps you in living a fulfilling life.\n\nPlato is one of the most famous philosophers of all time. He represented the philosophy of ancient Greece, belonging to its Classical Period. He was born into an aristocratic and influential family in Athens, where he founded the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the entire Western world. Along with his mentor Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is one of the most influential individuals in the entire history of humankind. It can even be said that he is one of the pillars of Western civilisation. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism and his biggest contribution is the Theory of Forms or Doctrine of Ideas, which asserts that the physical world is not the real world. Instead, ultimate reality exists beyond our physical world, in the world of ideas. Plato was not only a prominent figure of philosophy, but also of religion and spirituality; so-called Neo-platonism deeply influenced Christian theology. Plato invented the written dialogue and dialectic form of philosophy. Some of his most famous books are The Republic, The Symposium, The Apology of Socrates, Allegory of the Cave and The Dialogues of Plato, in which the main character is Socrates, who influenced Plato’s philosophy to a great extent. His entire work has survived for more than 2,400 years and has remained very popular the entire time. Like his mentor, Plato was a practical philosopher and there are many life lessons to learn from his philosophy.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZrbPC3Z1Kg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZrbPC3Z1Kg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZrbPC3Z1Kg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZrbPC3Z1Kg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZrbPC3Z1Kg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":47,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iZrbPC3Z1Kg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"04QklD25-PEr69FrMCdFdiWKQc0","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlVTWlJqQ0JZT3hj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-01-11T18:19:38Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"9 Life Lessons From Carl Jung (Jungian Philosophy)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 9 Life Lessons From Carl Jung. He found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology and his philosophy is dubbed as “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 9 important lessons that we can learn from Carl Jung - \n01. Look inside yourself first\n02. Integrate your contraries\n03. Analyze your dreams\n04. Learn to face reality\n05. Be aware of superstitions\n06. Think, do not judge\n07. Avoid excessive pride\n08. Be eager to grow older\n09. Tell your story\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 9 Life Lessons From Carl Jung will add value to your life. \n\nCarl Jung, together with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences - in other words, to make the unconscious conscious. Jung was born in Switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961, leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung had Freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him. This division was painful for Jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology, called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. If classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient’s past, as early experiences are very important in personality development, analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present, on mythology, folklore, and cultural experiences, to try to understand human consciousness. One of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which Jung founded is the process of individuation, which is the process of finding the self - something Jung considered an important task in human development. While he did not formulate a systematic philosophy, he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher - his school of thought dubbed “Jungian philosophy”. Its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences. A good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published. Some of his most important books are: “Psychology of the Unconscious”, “Man and His Symbols”, “The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious”, “Modern Man In Search of a Soul”, “The Psychology of the Transference”, “Memories, Dreams, Thoughts”, and “The Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious”. Besides being a great writer and a researcher, he was also an artist, a craftsman and even a builder. His contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USZRjCBYOxc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USZRjCBYOxc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USZRjCBYOxc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USZRjCBYOxc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USZRjCBYOxc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":48,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"USZRjCBYOxc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fD0iWiN-lDlk5j5EqUFY89mEJBg","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLndLaFp0ZGRsV2h3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-20T02:13:58Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Live In The Present - Albert Camus (Philosophy of Absurdism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to live in the present from the philosophy of Albert Camus. Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism\". \n\nHere are 7 ways you can make most of your present from the philosophy of Albert Camus- \n01. Have a motivation for living\n02. Be yourself at all times\n03.  Live intensively\n04. Live like a rebel\n05. Focus on practical things\n06. Accept the unpredictability of life\n07. Find happiness in every phase of your life\nI hope you enjoyed watching these 7 ways you can make most of your present from the philosophy of Albert Camus and find them helpful in your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKhZtddlWhw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKhZtddlWhw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKhZtddlWhw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKhZtddlWhw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKhZtddlWhw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":49,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wKhZtddlWhw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9l4LPbpmi9XrNCRCEjkmD7M1MZE","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjdUUmF6akxBS1dZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-01T02:00:01Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Own Yourself - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"Click on https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=philosophiesforlife_november&adgroup=youtube The first 100 people to download Endel will end up getting a free week of audio experiences.\nFriedrich Nietzsche - How To Own Yourself (Existentialism)\n \nIn this video we bring you how to own yourself from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche is a great example of a man who stood by his views, who was not shy to express them in a straightforward manner, no matter the cost. In other words, he owned himself and, in his view, no price is too high for the privilege of owning yourself. \n \nTo help you understand the ways in which you can better own yourself, here are 5 lessons we can learn from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche: \n01. Dare to stand alone \n02. Follow your wildest dreams \n03. Follow your goals, not a system\n04. Embrace your demons \n05. Give style to your character \nI hope you enjoyed watching these 5 ways you can own yourself from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and find them helpful in your life. \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n \nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7TRazjLAKWY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7TRazjLAKWY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7TRazjLAKWY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7TRazjLAKWY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7TRazjLAKWY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":50,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7TRazjLAKWY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"8seIBdQV1VD6DD7MzuWKtDwvxs4","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlk0eTJlNHJVeGZv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-17T23:00:26Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"9 Life Lessons From Socrates (Socratic Skepticism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 9 Life Lessons From Socrates. Socrates is sometimes considered as the founder of the Western philosophy and his work reflects the philosophy of Skepticism.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 9 important lessons that we can learn from Socrates - \n01. Open yourself to the truth \n02. Be courageous \n03. Be authentic\n04. Be humble\n05. Beware the busyness of life\n06. Be a citizen of the world\n07. Be happy with less\n08. Don’t seek vengeance\n09. Have a sense of humour\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 9 Life Lessons From Socrates will add value to your life. \n\nSocrates lived between 469 and 399 B.C.E. and he is one of the most famous philosophers in the entire history of humankind. He is sometimes considered as the founder of the Western philosophy and his work reflects the philosophy of Skepticism, which has as its main base that knowledge can be obtained through systematic doubt and continual testing. Although Socrates hasn't written anything, he has forever changed philosophy itself. Most of the things we know today about his philosophy came from Plato, Aristophanes and Xenophon whose writings are in the form of dialogues between Socrates and other Athenians. These writings gave birth to a new literary genre called the Socratic dialogue. Unfortunately, he is also famous for his tragic life. In 399 BCE, he was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and of failing to acknowledge the city's official gods. After a trial that lasted just a single day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing to escape. The way his life ended can be considered as the founding myth of philosophy as a discipline. For one to really practice philosophy, they have to go against societal norms, to question everything even at the risk of their own peril. Everything about Socrates was impressive: his appearance, personality, and behaviour, as well as in his views and methods. And this made many of the people around him to write about him, including Plato. It is unfortunate that Socrates did not write at all and all we have is indirect evidence. Also, it is said that each age produces a Socrates of its own, however there are some core fundamental teachings of the original Socrates that transcend the centuries.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4y2e4rUxfo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4y2e4rUxfo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4y2e4rUxfo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4y2e4rUxfo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4y2e4rUxfo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":51,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Y4y2e4rUxfo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"diiNexKa2TJE--I1wvWOYsMIDxc","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmU4Q2xxTnNWcm80","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-01T00:30:03Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"9 Life Lessons From Ayn Rand (Philosophy Of Objectivism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 9 Life Lessons From Ayn Rand. Ayn Rand  was a Russian-American writer and philosopher who lived in the twentieth century and is credited as a founder of philosophy of Objectivism. \n\nSo with that in mind, here are 9 important lessons that we can learn from Ayn Rand - \n01. Use reason in everything\n02. Be selfish \n03. Follow your own values \n04. Don’t play the victim \n05. Develop your self-esteem\n06. Be honest\n07. Earn your money honourably\n08. Never give up\n09. Always Keep growing\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 9 Life Lessons From Ayn Rand will add value to your life. \n\nAyn Rand  was a Russian-American writer and philosopher who lived in the twentieth century. Born in Russia, she moved to America when she was in her 20’s; there she wrote several novels, some of the most famous being: The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Towards the end of her life, she focused more on philosophy, founding the philosophy of Objectivism, the four main principles of which are: Objective reality, which is the reality that exists independently of consciousness, Absolute reason, which means that the guidance of facts far outweighs the guidance of faith or emotion, Individualism, which means the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness, and Laissez-faire capitalism, which is a system based on protecting human rights and property rights. Her main philosophical view is that knowledge can be acquired only through the process of reasoning and she rejected religion and faith. She attacked many past philosophers, with the exception of a few, like Aristotle and Thomas Acquinas. She was inspired by Nietzsche and John Locke and she was against Immanuel Kant, whom she named “the most evil man in mankind's history” because she thought his ethics opposed the self-interests of human beings. During her life, she was involved in many political movements and made connections with journalists, economists, including the economist Ludwig von Mises, who referred to her as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\", implying that she was more courageous, had more guts than any man. Through the Objectivism movement, her work became known more and more to the public.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n \nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8ClqNsVro4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8ClqNsVro4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8ClqNsVro4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8ClqNsVro4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8ClqNsVro4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":52,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"e8ClqNsVro4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Mpzwy5YhrcdkhJBbIL-rad3ZM3s","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkd6czZzX1NHbW5n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-10-14T22:00:07Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"4 Effortless Ways of dealing with changes in your life - Buddha (Buddhism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to deal with changes in life from the philosophy of The  Buddha. Gautama Buddha was a philosopher, a spiritual leader and is credited as the founder of Buddhism.\n\nThe teachings of Buddha revolve around Duhkha, which means suffering, and the end of Duhkha, which is regarded as the state of Nirvana. The philosophy’s most essential teaching includes the Three Marks of Existence, which are as follows: \n01. Annica which means that life is in a constant flux\n02. Duhkha which means that life is painful and causes suffering, and\n03. Anatta which means that the self is always changing\n\nAccording to Buddha, our thoughts and experiences are subject to these three marks of our existence. It is a way of understanding ourselves and the world around us and in this video we will be talking about the first mark of existence - Annica to better understand the ever-changing, impermanent nature of life and how we can deal with the changes that come with that. Here are 4 ways we can try to not only embrace life changes, but also be happy and grow with them, from the philosophy of The Buddha - \n01. Acknowledge the change\n02. Practice non-attachment  \n03. Embrace change\n04.

Around him developed a community of people, drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing this path. Nowadays, he is worshiped by most Buddhist schools as the enlightened one who has escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth, transcending Karma. Their main teachings focus on their insight into duhkha meaning “suffering” and into Nirvana, which means the end of suffering. \n\nVideos - \nhttps://www.pexels.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gzs6s_SGmng/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gzs6s_SGmng/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gzs6s_SGmng/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gzs6s_SGmng/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gzs6s_SGmng/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":53,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Gzs6s_SGmng"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"y__bx9YmNzQdnqVe2By8jbd7mnc","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjhoRGlWdV9aVDRV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-09-30T23:16:21Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"8 Life Lessons From Epicurus (Epicureanism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 8 Life Lessons From Epicurus. His philosophy is often referenced as Epicurean hedonism or simply Epicureanism. Epicurus was most famous for his skilful insights into the concept of happiness. \n\nTo understand more about Epicurus’ teachings and how we can apply them into our own lives, here are 8 life lessons from the philosophy of Epicurus - \n01. Be content with little\n02. Study philosophy all your life\n03. Learn to rely on yourself \n04. Develop courage through adversity\n05. Get great friends\n06. Do not try to be popular\n07. Don’t fear death\n08. Strive to achieve peace of mind\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 8 Life Lessons From Epicurus will add value to your life. \n\nEpicurus is one of the most important figures in the history of philosophy, as well as of science. He is less known than Plato or Socrates, but, nonetheless, his teachings are precious and timeless. He lived between 341 to 270 BC, and wrote more than 300 works during his lifetime. Most of his work has been lost, but what remains is extremely relevant even today. In science, he was one of the first to describe the natural world as made of atoms and he rightly understood that all the natural phenomena are in fact based on the movement of atoms. Also, he strongly stressed the importance of basing our beliefs on empirical evidence and logic. In philosophy, he was part of the hedonist movement and he was most famous for his skilful insights into the concept of happiness, starting his own School of Happiness, also known as Epicurean hedonism or simply Epicureanism. If stoics believed that living justly and virtuously is the highest good and that we should be indifferent to pleasure and pain, Epicureanism believed that we should seek to maximise the pleasures in life. There were some rumours that in his school people lavished  themselves in orgies, luxury and decadence, but these rumours were unfounded. Epicurus didn’t have any interest in orgies and expensive meals. His idea of pleasure is far from the classical one. He departed from the classical school of hedonism for which pleasure is the highest good, adding that the pleasure of the mind, not the pleasure of the senses, is the true ‘highest good’. He believed that the greatest happiness comes from reducing suffering, achieving an inner state of peace which he called ataraxia. Ataraxia means being content with simple things in life, like having philosophical conversations about the meaning of life, in your small garden, with your best friends. According to Epicurus, the pleasure from pursuing wisdom is the highest form of pleasure, and the most valuable as it is the one that leads us to true happiness. \n \nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n \nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n \nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n \nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hDiVu_ZT4U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hDiVu_ZT4U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hDiVu_ZT4U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hDiVu_ZT4U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hDiVu_ZT4U/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":54,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8hDiVu_ZT4U"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZZ14siv21hFbtKsFCuNd3v9zu60","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlRraExSYVEzazBV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-09-14T21:01:24Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Find Meaning In A Meaningless Life - Albert Camus (Philosophy of Absurdism)","description":"Start building your ideal daily routine!

Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” and his philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life. We often feel uprooted, having to choose between more options than ever before, being bombarded by technological devices, innovations, and information, each demanding our attention. So, to help you find your direction, in this video we bring you 5 ways to find meaning in life from the philosophy of Albert Camus.\n\nHere are 5 ways to find meaning in life from the philosophy of Albert Camus - \n01. Seek something worth dying for \n02. Decide your future every day \n03. Cultivate love \n04. Be your best at each moment \n05. Find strength in the darkest moments \nI hope you enjoyed watching these 5 ways to find meaning in life from the philosophy of Albert Camus and find them helpful in your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkhLRaQ3k0U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkhLRaQ3k0U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkhLRaQ3k0U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkhLRaQ3k0U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TkhLRaQ3k0U/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":55,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TkhLRaQ3k0U"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"CfiVVE9pJufLkjW39CxrJoWrvDM","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjJ2dlZIZF83UklJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-30T23:00:00Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Find Your Soulmate - Plato (Platonic Idealism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about how to find your soulmate from the philosophy of Plato. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism and he was one of the first thinkers who addressed the concept of soulmate.\n\nFor Plato, a soulmate is someone with whom we feel a very strong affinity, and the love we feel for that person goes beyond physical attraction. A soulmate is someone with whom we can be ourselves, in our complete nature. For Plato, romantic love is deemed to be of a higher metaphysical and ethical status than sexual or physical attractiveness alone. The idea of romantic love initially emerged from the Platonic concept of love as a deep affection, through which we can contemplate the real beauty of our being - and of the world. This beauty is not limited to physical beauty, but also involves a spiritual kind of beauty, Plato calling it “the Form of Beauty”. For Plato, the love of beauty culminates in the love of philosophy, the subject that pursues the highest capacity of thinking. So keeping his teachings in mind, in this video we bring you 5 ways to help you find your soulmate, from the philosophy of Plato: \n01. Believe that there is a soulmate for you\n02. Cultivate friendship\n03. Feel safe, like you belong\n04. Climb the ladder of love\n05. Reignite the poetry in your relationships\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 5 ways to help you find your soulmate from the philosophy of Plato will add value to your life. \n\nPlato is one of the most famous philosophers of all time. He represented the philosophy of ancient Greece, belonging to its Classical Period. He was born into an aristocratic and influential family in Athens, where he founded the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the entire Western world. Along with his mentor Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is one of the most influential individuals in the entire history of humankind. It can even be said that he is one of the pillars of Western civilisation. His philosophy is often referenced as Platonic idealism and his biggest contribution is the Theory of Forms or Doctrine of Ideas, which asserts that the physical world is not the real world. Instead, ultimate reality exists beyond our physical world, in the world of ideas. Plato was not only a prominent figure of philosophy, but also of religion and spirituality; so-called Neo-platonism deeply influenced Christian theology. Plato invented the written dialogue and dialectic form of philosophy. Some of his most famous books are The Republic, The Symposium, The Apology of Socrates, Allegory of the Cave and The Dialogues of Plato, in which the main character is Socrates, who influenced Plato’s philosophy to a great extent. His entire work has survived for more than 2,400 years and has remained very popular the entire time. Like his mentor, Plato was a practical philosopher and there are many life lessons to learn from his philosophy.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vvVHd_7RII/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vvVHd_7RII/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vvVHd_7RII/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vvVHd_7RII/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vvVHd_7RII/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":56,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2vvVHd_7RII"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HIeRHZya-gRvQ7JBQ04JQnpMAEY","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjJTMm5sOFU4VnVr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-11T02:00:00Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Achieve Self Mastery - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"Go to https://nordvpn.com/philosophiesforlife or use code philosophiesforlife to get a 2-year plan plus 4 additional months with a huge discount!\nFriedrich Nietzsche - How To Achieve Self Mastery (Existentialism)\n\nIn this video we bring you how to achieve self mastery from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Friedrich Nietzsche believed that the fundamental drive of all living things is the so-called Will to Power, which is often seen as the impulse to overcome one’s environment, the impulse to grow, expand, and explore, but the greatest power one can possess, in Nietzsche’s view, is not the power over other people or environment, but the power over your own self. Mastering yourself is the foundation of all the other skills and powers you have and it is the one you have to focus on first in order to achieve greatness. \n\nTo help you understand the ways in which you can achieve self-mastery, here are 7 lessons we can learn from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche: \n01. Obey yourself first\n02. Strengthen your will \n03. Master your temper\n04. Master your decision-making process \n05. Master your body\n06. Master your heart\n07. Find happiness in self-mastery\nI hope you enjoyed watching these 7 ways you can achieve self-mastery from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and find them helpful in your life. \n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher, poet, essayist, and cultural critic. He is considered to be one of the most daring and greatest thinkers of all time. His writings on truth, morality, language, aesthetics, cultural theory, history, nihilism, power, consciousness, and the meaning of existence have exerted an enormous influence on Western philosophy and intellectual history. He was one of the biggest precursors of existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent, determining their own development through acts of will. By his famous words “God is dead!”, Nietzsche moved the focus of philosophy from metaphysics to the material world and to the individual as a responsible person for his own life. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote several books like The Birth of a Tragedy,  Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, The Will to Power, The Antichrist, and many more. His teachings have shaped the lives of many people; from psychologists to poets, dancers to social revolutionaries.\n\nResearch/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz\nhttps://biancaszasz.com/\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nMusic: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S2nl8U8Vuk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S2nl8U8Vuk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S2nl8U8Vuk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S2nl8U8Vuk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S2nl8U8Vuk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":57,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2S2nl8U8Vuk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"XBEZj9U6FENwTGzSz89kOLVfVTg","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkF6eW04NnlBWno0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-07-26T02:00:02Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"7 Life Lessons From Aristotle (Aristotelianism)","description":"Become smarter in 5 minutes by signing up to Morning Brew for free today: https://cen.yt/mbphilosophiesforlife \n7 Life Lessons from Aristotle (Aristotelianism)\n\nIn this video we will be talking about 7 Life Lessons From Aristotle.

Kant. Immanuel Kant  is considered to be one of the central Enlightenment thinkers of all time. His philosophy is called Kantianism. \n\nSo here are 7 time management tips from Immanuel Kant - \n01. Organize yourself\n02. Follow through\n03. Follow universal principles in your daily activities\n04. Schedule time for developing your skills\n05. Make time for the small things\n06. Make time for your other duties \n07. Make time for moral self-development\nHope you enjoyed this video and find these insights on time management from Immanuel Kant helpful. \n\nImmanuel Kant lived in the 18th century and is considered to be one of the greatest German philosophers and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers of all time. His philosophical revolution was to place the human at the center of the philosophical study of knowledge, morality, and beauty.  He deeply believed that reason is the root of morality. His thoughts on the relationship between reason and human experience led to the notion of “procedural humanism” or “Kantian humanism”. \nThe work of Immanuel Kant is still relevant today as the humanistic values of Western culture are deeply influenced by the Kantian moral philosophy. His philosophy is called Kantianism\nThe fundamental idea of Kant’s “critical philosophy” – especially in his three Critiques: the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) – is human autonomy. He argues that human understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and immortality.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stBk8uxR-FE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stBk8uxR-FE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stBk8uxR-FE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stBk8uxR-FE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stBk8uxR-FE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":59,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"stBk8uxR-FE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"BD0K6WNcbQoomQAn2H-QYvDsDJk","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLk1rQmFIM2FmUGdJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-06-24T20:00:02Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"9 Life Lessons From Plato (Platonic Idealism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 9 Life Lessons From Plato.

He was one of the precursors of existentialism. Existentialism is more a cultural movement rather than a philosophical one, which considers that freedom is at the core of human existence, all human values should be based on it and, moreover, existentialism affirms “the categorical moral imperative of authenticity”. In line with the theory of existentialism, Nietzsche talked about the importance of having an authentic life. In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person's actions are in line with their beliefs and desires, despite the pressure from society to behave in one way or another.  Nietzsche emphasized having the courage to be authentic and to fight against the tyranny of popular beliefs. So to understand how his ideas can help you in your life, here are 7 ways we can learn to be authentic from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n01. Accept yourself as a totality\n02. Follow your own path\n03. Accept that you are different\n04. Obey only yourself\n05. Do not be ashamed  \n06. Forgive yourself\n07.

Albert Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” and his philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life. \n\nSo with that in mind, here are 7 important lessons that we can learn from Albert Camus - \n01. Create your own meaning for life\n02. Don’t make happiness a distant goal\n03. Don’t be ignorant\n04. Be a rebel\n05. Spend time with yourself\n06. Be flexible\n07. Choose Love\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 7 Life Lessons From Albert Camus will add value to your life. \n\nAlbert Camus is one of the greatest French writers and thinkers. He was a philosopher, an author and a journalist. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and his most famous works are The Stranger, The Plague, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, and The Rebel. Camus is one of the most representative figures of the philosophy of the “absurd” or “absurdism,” which is a philosophical movement having as its central hypothesis that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Camus considered that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice - too much freedom leads to the situation when the strong suppresses the weak but too much justice kills freedom, and we need to live and let live. As a promoter of the philosophy of the “absurd”, Camus believed that life has no meaning, that the universe simply exists and that it is indifferent to people’s lives. We are like Sisyphus from Greek mythology, forever carrying that heavy rock to the top of the hill, although we know the rock will always fall down and our life's work is meaningless. Our condition might be tragic, but Camus considered that this exact condition hides a blessing in disguise: life does not have a meaning, but we are free to attribute it any meaning we want. His philosophy has inspired a lot of  people in dealing with the absurdity of life and even today, his philosophy is extremely relevant.\n\nNarration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen\nhttps://www.dmcvoiceovers.com\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Idhb8OVDCM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Idhb8OVDCM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Idhb8OVDCM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Idhb8OVDCM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Idhb8OVDCM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":62,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8Idhb8OVDCM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Hs9o4KY865pdhWkGPLs8aTCinSM","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkxBRjctZjFHUjlJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-05-13T02:00:05Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Become A Free Spirit - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"In this video we will talk about how to become a free spirit from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

He was definitely a genius. He started to learn Greek alphabet and to play piano when he was only 3 years old, he was one of the brightest students and at age of 23, he was the youngest Professor of Greek Linguistics. He was a very close friend of the famous composer Richard Wagner and with other famous personalities and he later became one of the greatest philosophers of all time. He wrote several books, including “Thus Spoke Zarathustra”, “Beyond Good and Evil”, “The Birth of Tragedy”, “The Twilight of the Idols” and his teachings continue to shock the world, even today. For Nietzsche, history itself is a process of creating geniuses; each genius is somebody who creates the mental world in which his successors will live. In other words, the history of the world follows the work of the geniuses. Although Nietzsche’s life took a tragic turn, he created a new mental world to inspire generations. His teachings inspire everyone who dreams of becoming a genius, helping them to find that inner voice to guide them throughout their life. According to Nietzsche, if you don’t cultivate your inner genius, if you don’t own yourself, you have lived a life of “laziness.” Certain steps in life can only be walked by you and only by discovering that inner genius can you walk that path.\n\nSo to help you uncover your own path, in this video, we bring you 7 ways in which you can find your inner genius, from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche - \n01.

He is mostly known for his famous book “The World as Will and Representation”. He is known as the ultimate pessimist and his idea reflects philosophical pessimism.\n\nSo here are 7 ways you can follow in order to become a pessimist  from the wisdom of Arthur Schopenhauer - \n01.

Limit your expectations\n07. Find Happiness within yourself\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 7 ways you can follow in order to become a pessimist from the wisdom of Arthur Schopenhauer will add value to your life.  \n\nArthur Schopenhauer was one of the greatest philosophers of all time. He lived from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 19th century in Germany. His most important work was “The World As Will and Representation”. He was one of the most prominent figures of the philosophy of pessimism and the first great Western philosopher who was interested in Buddhism. The best way to understand his teachings is to analyze them through the eyes of the enlightened pessimism prevalent in Buddhist philosophy. Arthur Schopenhauer is known as the ultimate pessimist because he articulates a pessimistic worldview that questions life’s meaning. He believed that the universe was fundamentally irrational and human beings are driven by a force called the Will, a basic force in the Universe, never satisfied, and we, the human beings, don’t have much self-control to fight it. Schopenhauer argues that the best way to be happy is by ceasing to look for happiness and instead try to remove the unhappiness from our life. This idea reflects philosophical pessimism, which is not a psychological disposition, but rather a worldview. Philosophical pessimism suggests that it is always better to expect the worst in order to receive the best. By using the principles of philosophical pessimism, we can eliminate the irrational hopes and expectations we have in life and thus we can live more peacefully and happily.\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAWQzQ3F9L4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAWQzQ3F9L4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAWQzQ3F9L4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAWQzQ3F9L4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAWQzQ3F9L4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":66,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KAWQzQ3F9L4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Cv-gSbArzCWF_EPtHWg1vCJwcyw","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLm5jTWhsc1BKc3lz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-17T02:00:05Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"7 Ways To Change Your Life - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"Click on https://go.babbel.com/6m50-youtube-philosophiesforlife-jan-2021/default to learn a new language today and get 65% off your Babbel subscription! \nFriedrich Nietzsche - 7 Ways To Change Your Life (Existentialism)\n\nIn this video, we will be talking about 7 ways to change your life from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

His philosophical revolution was to place the human at the center of the philosophical study of knowledge, morality, and beauty.  He deeply believed that reason is the root of morality. His thoughts on the relationship between reason and human experience led to the notion of “procedural humanism” or “Kantian humanism”. \nThe work of Immanuel Kant is still relevant today as the humanistic values of Western culture are deeply influenced by the Kantian moral philosophy. His philosophy is called Kantianism\nThe fundamental idea of Kant’s “critical philosophy” – especially in his three Critiques: the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) – is human autonomy. He argues that human understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and immortality.\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_yk0lK3-S8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_yk0lK3-S8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_yk0lK3-S8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_yk0lK3-S8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_yk0lK3-S8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":74,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"L_yk0lK3-S8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tdK-7RiJEKwrvsyh1W3Ll-gQXcs","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLjkxMVdqMWVpYWhR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-11-17T01:30:31Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"6 Ways To Be More Productive - Marcus Aurelius (Stoicism)","description":"First 100 people to click on https://www.blinkist.com/philosophiesforlife will get a 7 day free trial and will also receive a 25% discount on their one year plan.\nMarcus Aurelius - How To Be Productive (Stoicism)\n\nIn this video we will be talking about 6 important insights for being productive from the writings of Marcus Aurelius.

During his time, he constructed a series of autobiographical writings known as the Meditations, in which he  constantly advocated for finding stillness in life and while his meditations regularly speak of the importance of waking up early and seizing the day, he also stressed the importance of taking time to retreat into oneself and find stillness. Thanks to his journalling, we have a fair idea of what his evening routine would have looked like and in this video we will be diving into 7 different things Marcus Aurelius would have done in his evenings and how we can follow or adapt that routine to our modern day lives.\n\nSo here are 7 things you can do in your evenings from the evening routine of Marcus Aurelius - \n01.

Gautama Buddha was a philosopher, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who is credited as the founder of Buddhism.\n\nSo with that in mind, here are 10 important lessons that we can learn from Gautama Buddha -\n01. Practice the Middle Way\n02. Adopt the right view     \n03. Create good karma \n04. Live everyday like it is your last\n05. Great things are the results of small good habits\n06.

You can be a Buddha too\n\nI hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 10 life lessons from Buddha will add value to your life.  \n\nThe Buddha was a philosopher, meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who is credited as the founder of Buddhism. He was born as Siddhartha Gautama in India in 566 BC into an aristocratic family and when he was twenty-nine years old, he left the comforts of his home to seek the meaning of the suffering he saw around him. \n\nAfter six years of arduous yogic training, he abandoned the way of self-mortification and instead sat in mindful meditation beneath a bodhi tree. On the full moon of May, with the rising of the morning star, Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha, the awakened one. The Buddha wandered the plains of northeastern India for 45 years more, teaching the path or Dharma he had realized in that moment. Around him developed a community of people, drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing this path.\n\nNowadays, he is worshiped by most Buddhist schools as the enlightened one who has escaped the cycle of birth and rebirth, transcending Karma. Their main teachings focus on their insight into duhkha meaning “suffering” and into Nirvana, which means the end of suffering. \n\nSubscribe To Philosophies for Life\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnQuIGxteGI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnQuIGxteGI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnQuIGxteGI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnQuIGxteGI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnQuIGxteGI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":78,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lnQuIGxteGI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"sdUMFp-3bOcnm7PnUjbXE2nGb9w","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLl9IRjlucGVDM3Vj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-09-13T16:00:05Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Become A Superhuman - Friedrich Nietzsche (Existentialism)","description":"In this video we will understand how we can all become superhuman, according to the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

In order to know how to balance your life, you need Lagom, as it embraces a balanced, sustainable lifestyle.\n\nIn order to understand how to  balance your life using Lagom approach, we have  broken up this video into four main categories - \n01. Lagom at work.\n02. Lagom at home\n03. Lagom for health\n04. Lagom and nature\n\nLagom, the Swedish word for a lifestyle that encourages balance and mindfulness in everything that you do. Lagom is a thread that ties many parts of Swedish society and culture together, the cornerstone of personal behaviour, design ethos and community. Applying a sense of lagom to our everyday lives – be it in what we eat, what we wear, how we live, how we work – might just be the antidote to our modern, consumption-led world as it embraces a more balanced, sustainable lifestyle that embraces the pleasures of existence rather than those of consumption. Lagom celebrates the idea of “just enough” which is the perfect space between minimalism and living in excess and this particular brand of socialism is partly the reason why Sweden consistently ranks top ten in the happiest countries in the world. \n\nBook referred - Live Lagom: Balanced Living, The Swedish Way by Anna Brones\n\nSubscribe To Philosophies For Life –\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DuBVFiMRtI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DuBVFiMRtI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DuBVFiMRtI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DuBVFiMRtI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DuBVFiMRtI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":86,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4DuBVFiMRtI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yAdWYNQWFUanBv_aVy0THgp82II","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLmV5cDQ3el93aVJR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-03-01T15:00:07Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Be Happy - Seneca (Stoicism)","description":"Get 70% off NordVPN!

Lao Tzu is considered to be the founder of Taoism and is also credited as the writer of Taoism’s most sacred text, Tao Te Ching. \n\nSo here are 10 Taoism lessons that we can learn from Lao Tzu\n01. Look within and you will find everything you need\n02. By letting go, you become free\n03. Let go of your labels if you truly want to know yourself\n04. Pay no attention to evil and it will crumble away\n05. Kindness and compassion for others will always win in the end\n06. Be yourself without caring what others think\n07. Wisdom and strength come from remaining humble\n08. Change is inevitable, so embrace it, even if it seems uncomfortable\n09. Learn to follow first if you ever wish to lead\n10. Always go with the flow\n\nTaoism is a Chinese philosophy attributed to Lao Tzu which contributed to the folk religion of the people primarily in the rural areas of China and became the official religion of the country under the Tang Dynasty. Taoism is therefore both a philosophy and a religion. Taoism teaches to embrace wonder and the joy in living gracefully with style. Lao Tzu is a central figure in Chinese culture, but his words can apply to people all over the world. Hope we could add value with this video.\n\nSubscribe To Downtown Success –\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NtcgJ1yZkIc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NtcgJ1yZkIc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NtcgJ1yZkIc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NtcgJ1yZkIc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NtcgJ1yZkIc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":95,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NtcgJ1yZkIc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"YlrCN2hKhCYSN1Tiet3xxFDrTQY","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLnl4Y0ZLdHVwakw0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-07-22T03:58:33Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Build Your Self Confidence - Marcus Aurelius (Stoicism)","description":"In this video we will be talking about 10 important insights for building your Self Confidence from the writings of Marcus Aurelius.

In this video we will be talking about 5 very important and very practical time management tips that will help you to do everything you wish to do. \n\nImagine there is a bank that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening it deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course! Each of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose.\n\nIt carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours. There is no going back. There is no drawing against the \"tomorrow\". Therefore there is not enough time or too much time. \n\nTime management is decided by us and nobody else. It is never the case of us not having time to do things, but the case of whether we want to do it.\n\nHere are 5 Time Management Tips discussed in the video - \n1. Eat That Frog\n2.

(The truth no one will tell )","description":"We make money because we think that with more money, we can be confident, be respected and be happy. But do we need money to be happy? The real truth no one tells us about making money is that beyond a point, more money can decrease the level of happiness. \n\nAccording to the research conducted by the Princeton University, that happiness and income are correlated, but only up to $75,000.The emotional well-being of a person rises as annual income increases up to about $75,000, but not further than that. This makes sense because people who make significantly less than $75,000 spend a lot of their time worrying about basic necessities like having enough food to eat and covering the rent. Money can pretty easily alleviate those kinds of stress. So boosting one's income up to around $75,000 can help. But as wealth rises, happiness level remains the same. In fact, happiness might tend to decrease. Part of the diminishing-return effect can be explained by adaptations — as wealth rises, people adjust or get used to their new and better circumstances. This increases their expectations and aspirations. For example, a newly rich person moving to an upscale neighborhood will make the acquaintance of other people who seem even wealthier, and that can diminish happiness. He may be driven to increase earnings by comparison to others or a desire for material gains. \n\nThis video also answers one of the biggest questions is how to allocate our money? the truth is, often when we buy that new pair of shoes or new car, we regret our purchases because we feel we may have made the wrong choice, or that we have spent too extravagantly, or something better will be available in the future.  This feeling is called “buyer’s remorse. The reason for this is that when we buy objects they are easily interchangeable with other objects. We get a brand new car, but there’s a new model out within the next 6 months. Material things tend to eventually become out-dated or broken. We get an initial boost in mood when we first buy them, but it quickly dies off. “One of the enemies of happiness is adaptation,” says Dr. Thomas Gilovich, a psychology professor at Cornell University who has been studying the question of money and happiness for over two decades. Gilovich and other researchers have found that experiences—as fleeting as they may be—deliver more-lasting happiness than things.\n\nSubscribe to Downtown Success for more content.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nLink - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kpdYcY1uSY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kpdYcY1uSY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kpdYcY1uSY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kpdYcY1uSY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kpdYcY1uSY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":105,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5kpdYcY1uSY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"YRRmzj6uE1xTEAD6PSTMqVBosgA","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLkNjZmRrVFpXcGZV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-11-11T21:30:00Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"How To Be As Productive As Warren Buffet - 5 Highly Effective Lessons","description":"How to be productive?

Waking up early in the morning can be difficult, but I think it’s actually much easier than people realize. The key to waking up early is to find your “Ikigai” meaning giving yourself a solid reason to wake up - something to do in every morning that excites you the most. \n\nIn order to wake up early in the morning ask yourself this one simple question - If I had more time, what are the things I could do. You may come up with multiple answers, so select that one thing that excites you the most.  It is a task you need to complete as soon as you wake up before you start off with your day because the whole world is quite and you have ample of time for yourself to pursue the activity you are excited about which will eventually help you to have healthy social connections, to challenge yourself in a good way, to relieve stress, to be fit, to be creative and to ward off depression.

Science says that 92 Percent of People Don't Achieve Success. The other 8% achieve their success not just by setting the right goals and by following a well-disciplined routine but also by successfully applying Abraham Lincoln's quote which is - \n“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax.” It means that when one has a goal, one should devote resources to the means one uses for achieving this goal. The most important resource at our disposal for a successful life is other people. According to research by social psychologist, Dr. David McClelland of Harvard, the people you habitually associate with determines as much as 95 percent of your success or failure in life.\nIt’s a fact of life that some people hold us back, while other propel us forward.\n\nSo here are 5 types of people who will make you rich and successful.\n1.

You’re optimistic that this target could help you change your life for the better and you’re genuinely serious about making a go of it and hopefully making something happen. Then you tell it to your friends and family so that they can support you.  Chances are that upon telling that person you will feel an instant sense of relief, as though you had already accomplished what it was that you were setting out to do. This is what we call the ‘social reality’ – simply having your goal acknowledged makes it a part of your identity and results in a rush of feel-good reward hormones. Unfortunately, this satisfaction then tricks your brain into thinking that the job is already done – and you then feel less motivated to actually go out and really achieve the goal. It’s like it has already happened.\nThere are other reasons not to tell others goals as well which include practical and psychological arguments. For one, if you tell someone your goal this can then increase pressure in a negative way, which may not be helpful when the goal is something that requires you to remain calm and composed. A perfect example is taking any entrance test: many people choose not to tell their friends and family when taking their G.MAT or S.A.T. tests because they don’t want to risk having to face anyone when they fail. \nAnother reason not to tell people your goals is that they can then end up judging your actions, which may end up being unhelpful. Tell someone you want to run a marathon for instance and you can find that they end up giving you looks every time you don’t train or relax. This can actually remove your determination to stick to a training as nobody likes being controlled and our natural tendency is to do the opposite of what we feel pressured into doing.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chZvJvMYppQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chZvJvMYppQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chZvJvMYppQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chZvJvMYppQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chZvJvMYppQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":114,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"chZvJvMYppQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"VcmQk6yC7Eum8zWOaboDysmIiZ0","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLk5mZHdOVW8xenFZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-09-09T21:25:05Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"Replace Failure With Feedback: The Best Way To Deal With Failure And Always Succeed","description":"How to deal with failure? How to overcome failure? Replace Failure With Feedback and you will always succeed. \n\nFailure is defined as a lack of success and we define failure as defeat. So why is it that highly successful people are the ones who have failed the most? The answer is quite simple, the highly successful people replace the word failure with feedback and rise above their criticism, instead of taking it as defeat. \n\nDo subscribe to us for weekly videos - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ\n\nIt is very important to replace failure with feedback. This way you will eliminate all the negative connotations that are linked with failure.  Feedback encourages constructive thinking and has a positive impact on creativity. Failure is a concept that creates negativity.  It breeds pessimistic thinking.  The feelings of inadequacy and discouragement that accompany the belief that you are not measuring up discourage and de-motivate further efforts. When you eliminate the concept of failure and replace it with the idea of getting feedback the whole focus shifts. Feedback puts attention on learning what works and doesn’t work.  This information allows the person to take risks and seek different solutions. Feedback allows for flexibility.  When you recognize something is not working you take another approach.  You let go of ‘Ill-formed’ language when you discard the word ‘Failure’.  \n\nMusic - Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment\nLink - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfdwNUo1zqY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfdwNUo1zqY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfdwNUo1zqY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfdwNUo1zqY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfdwNUo1zqY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","playlistId":"UUp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","position":115,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NfdwNUo1zqY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Philosophies for Life","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"JmGX-t0zBwH2hROvfJ6-YBbjBIA","id":"VVVwMW1SVGtWbHFEbnh6XzlTMFlEOVlRLlpyRGRiSk93VlRr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-09-02T20:00:02Z","channelId":"UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ","title":"Why Life Should NOT Be Perfect","description":"Life Should Not Be Perfect.
