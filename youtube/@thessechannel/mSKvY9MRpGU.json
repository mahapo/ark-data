also"},{"startMs":380820,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"something that I'm going to study"},{"startMs":383880,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"so let's do it by looking

upside"},{"startMs":426479,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"and here's how it looks"},{"startMs":429660,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"um you could see that economic

wants"},{"startMs":475139,"durationMs":5101,"subtitle":"to study and call it but it disputed"},{"startMs":478380,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"so let's do it"},{"startMs":480240,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"and I'm going to do it by looking into"},{"startMs":481860,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"changes in the index"},{"startMs":484199,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"and how the change and the variations"},{"startMs":486060,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and the changes in that next

economic"},{"startMs":493919,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"system that is affected"},{"startMs":497099,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"so I take the Delta which is the the"},{"startMs":499740,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"change of the sentiment index and the"},{"startMs":501660,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"mass square so I say like here's the"},{"startMs":503400,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"change and there's a change squared so"},{"startMs":505680,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"having a very easy measure of the"},{"startMs":507720,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"sentiment index and you can see that"},{"startMs":510180,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"yeah"},{"startMs":511800,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"if the max Z reacts for instance and"},{"startMs":514560,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"becomes larger"},{"startMs":516300,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"then you have a small effect"},{"startMs":518700,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"on simple experience"},{"startMs":521399,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"and if you have a Schooners if that"},{"startMs":523680,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"becomes a little bit more skewed which"},{"startMs":525420,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"is rather likely when the max

positive"},{"startMs":532380,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"effect but the day after it falls back"},{"startMs":535740,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"uh so it's kind of"},{"startMs":538380,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"corrects itself"},{"startMs":540720,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"so it seems like the TCP data covaries"},{"startMs":543180,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"with the variance and Market sentiment"},{"startMs":546000,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"yeah so"},{"startMs":550620,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"let's look at the bigger picture now"},{"startMs":553740,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"so if this is true right if the DSP data"},{"startMs":557100,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"actually reacts in Market sentiment what"},{"startMs":559140,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"does that mean well we know that

there's"},{"startMs":574260,"durationMs":4199,"subtitle":"a lot of noise in it too as well but it"},{"startMs":576120,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"reacts to current attempts but

affecting"},{"startMs":586620,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"them emotionally you could have an"},{"startMs":588180,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"intersection there is but"},{"startMs":590880,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"thank you and then that's probably where"},{"startMs":593760,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"you could place a stock market returns"},{"startMs":595500,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"in this sense as well and you could do"},{"startMs":598140,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"the same within such as that is going to"},{"startMs":600540,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"be an intersection between sentiment"},{"startMs":602760,"durationMs":5639,"subtitle":"attention and TCP dates all of it and"},{"startMs":606000,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"that's probably what we can see and"},{"startMs":608399,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"what's causing these coordinations to"},{"startMs":610620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"exist"},{"startMs":613080,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"now how to study that is not super easy"},{"startMs":616500,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"but you could do it by something that's"},{"startMs":618420,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"called a factor analysis"},{"startMs":620459,"durationMs":4261,"subtitle":"and that is you could say like okay"},{"startMs":622440,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"there is some latent factors out there"},{"startMs":624720,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"some letters of Latin factors causing"},{"startMs":627060,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the data to materialize and I'm going

C"},{"startMs":636120,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"could be clear to tension could be"},{"startMs":638160,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"something like this"},{"startMs":639959,"durationMs":4581,"subtitle":"now the GSP data might cause all of"},{"startMs":642360,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"these and then they"},{"startMs":644540,"durationMs":3419,"subtitle":"will cause these variables to"},{"startMs":646800,"durationMs":3779,"subtitle":"materialize"},{"startMs":647959,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"returns you've sent that box sentiment"},{"startMs":650579,"durationMs":6781,"subtitle":"if it searches and so forth"},{"startMs":654899,"durationMs":5161,"subtitle":"but the problem is that to make a factor"},{"startMs":657360,"durationMs":3479,"subtitle":"analysis you can't really do it like"},{"startMs":660060,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"this"},{"startMs":660839,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"because that requires a lot of

one"},{"startMs":666480,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"variable into three"},{"startMs":667980,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"so you have to move it over to the other"},{"startMs":669660,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"side"},{"startMs":670440,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"and say like well the DSP data could be"},{"startMs":673019,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"causing these levels"},{"startMs":675120,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"together with the factors"},{"startMs":677459,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"and then you're going to do a factor"},{"startMs":679860,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"analysis on all of them

I"},{"startMs":691320,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"identify factors and then I try to"},{"startMs":693360,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"filter because it couldn't be a lot

that"},{"startMs":704880,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"so I do this by basically saying"},{"startMs":707459,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"assuming"},{"startMs":708959,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"that the factors can be broken down into"},{"startMs":712500,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"three different parts one Trend"},{"startMs":714600,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"component which is a Tau one

that"},{"startMs":724160,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"uh if you if you write it up like this"},{"startMs":727920,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"you can say that well the trend"},{"startMs":729839,"durationMs":6721,"subtitle":"component which is the filtered series"},{"startMs":732800,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"can be found by simply

very"},{"startMs":799160,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"untransparent what does this really mean"},{"startMs":802560,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"so you can also do something it's more"},{"startMs":805380,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"simpler you can see like Okay so"},{"startMs":807839,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"you can find the correlations

day"},{"startMs":834660,"durationMs":6299,"subtitle":"that one will be a stressed day"},{"startMs":838440,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"so to do that and then you could say"},{"startMs":840959,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"like okay if there isn't the average"},{"startMs":843060,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"goes up which requires a lot of

I'm"},{"startMs":873120,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"going to call this attention"},{"startMs":874560,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and then engagement adds the max is in"},{"startMs":877740,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"the variable out there and that one"},{"startMs":879600,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"seems to be how engaged are we

it"},{"startMs":1049520,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"looks more or less noisy"},{"startMs":1051799,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"so at First Site you would say nah not"},{"startMs":1055340,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"really"},{"startMs":1056440,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"but let's do some econometrics and see"},{"startMs":1059120,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"what we can find out"},{"startMs":1062660,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"now writing down the most simple"},{"startMs":1064460,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"equation you can think about when it"},{"startMs":1066320,"durationMs":4739,"subtitle":"comes to GDP in this sense you would
