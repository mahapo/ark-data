wanted"},{"startMs":3468240,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"it and after that actually that was the final step before I switched to astronomy I later did"},{"startMs":3474840,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"a PhD in astronomy working with quasars actually very much like our ideas also on the quasars and"},{"startMs":3483360,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"which I didn't follow later but it's helped me very much for my journey as a scientist"},{"startMs":3489840,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and well today I'm also involved in cities such as for extraterrestrial technology technology and"},{"startMs":3496800,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"I wanted just to ask you sort of so that was my just comment on that it has been very important"},{"startMs":3502860,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"for me to um these ideas of transparagement for my professional career and I actually wanted to ask"},{"startMs":3510420,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"you if you would pick your favorite two methods to search for life outside the Earth how would"},{"startMs":3518160,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"you do it what would you better well I think I would do two things one is to look for evidence"},{"startMs":3526020,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"of exoplanets with living signatures and that is a is a possibility that is really very close"},{"startMs":3532200,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"to being realized we have for example the James Webb Telescope uh Hubble Telescope which is until"},{"startMs":3538620,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"recently and so on so spectroscopy very detailed spectroscopy of did any detected exoplanet might"},{"startMs":3547980,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"reveal uh signs of of biochemistry but in terms of I mean showing that life exists"},{"startMs":3555840,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"or that transpermeables the the reason for life existing on the earth this has also to be resolved"},{"startMs":3563940,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"decisively because the data is there as I pointed out I mean there are tons of material biological"},{"startMs":3571800,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"material falling on the Earth every single minute and they're just being swamped by the by"},{"startMs":3579420,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"the native biology there's so much Hospitality so much bacteria on the Earth but it is really really"},{"startMs":3586380,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"very important I think that we use our available biological techniques and experimental techniques"},{"startMs":3593760,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"to to try to separate the in Falling component from the indigenous component and to see how"},{"startMs":3602280,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"these two components first of all this is to show that an alien component does exist right and we"},{"startMs":3610020,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"can do that for example by studying the isotope the signatures of the bacteria that are coming in"},{"startMs":3618660,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"for example for instance if the uh if the alien bacteria came from a source where the carbon"},{"startMs":3627540,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"isotope ratio is different from the earth we would we could perhaps detect the difference here on the"},{"startMs":3634500,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"earth uh just means there's a spoon coming here yeah so that's one one way of discriminating"},{"startMs":3641400,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"between then falling bacteria and Indigenous bacteria that should be should be done as"},{"startMs":3649740,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"urgently as possible and so that's that's the second first is to look for about signatures"},{"startMs":3656820,"durationMs":9060,"subtitle":"in exoplanets and then to study as in as detailed away as possible that component of living material"},{"startMs":3665880,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"that is definitely extraterrestrial and there is evidence that such material does exist so"},{"startMs":3672420,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"the travestyo of of science is it it's an insult to our collective intelligence that this is not"},{"startMs":3679980,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"being done and in in your personal case that people didn't even want to hear your your"},{"startMs":3686220,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"assessment of the transform yeah still I mean that's that's censorship at a very deep level"},{"startMs":3694320,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"well I am thankful for that to happen because it brought me to astronomy and it brought me to"},{"startMs":3699540,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"the where I am today so in the end I'm quite happy for all these events yeah I'm enjoying"},{"startMs":3707040,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"my my science where I am today really yeah astronomy is a really exciting uh discipline"},{"startMs":3713280,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and it's getting more exciting with all the new developments in your astronomical telescopes to"},{"startMs":3719460,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"space telescopes the exploration of asteroids and so on it's it's it's accelerating it at such a"},{"startMs":3726780,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"pace that sooner or later it will not be possible to deny the fact that there is life outside there"},{"startMs":3735720,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"I think the same thank you for joining us Beatrice uh we've got we're going to go just"},{"startMs":3742500,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"a little bit past the hour um and we've got I'm going to say two more questions sort of"},{"startMs":3749700,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"um one is I got I had a question of my own and I see other people are thinking similar things"},{"startMs":3753900,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"you were talking earlier about the um what was my notes the uh initial Cosmic Legacy"},{"startMs":3761160,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"uh that that is responsible for this panspermia and then we also have Gene Thomas who had a"},{"startMs":3767580,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"comment that even if life was later spread throughout the Universe it nonetheless had"},{"startMs":3771780,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"to have a beginning or many Beginnings that did not rely on seeding from other sources thus Cosmic"},{"startMs":3777060,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"life is a combination of the spontaneous generation and uh panspermia and then also"},{"startMs":3783120,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"um Stephen Hall says even if panspermia is the way life began on Earth he would still"},{"startMs":3788160,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"need to account for the origin elsewhere right yeah so how how do you respond to these ideas"},{"startMs":3794940,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"but I think I think I think he's right I mean we really got to find an answer to if it ever"},{"startMs":3802740,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"started if it was eternally present then we don't need to to worry about uh any any start"},{"startMs":3809820,"durationMs":8940,"subtitle":"of life or any start or anything but if it did start in uh in a location that is much bigger"},{"startMs":3818760,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"than the earth right for instance if the if the space that is needed for spontaneous generation"},{"startMs":3824700,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"is essentially a whole galaxy or a cluster of galaxies how did it start there how did it uh"},{"startMs":3831480,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"overcome the the the improbability odds against life that I have mentioned I mean Paul and I had"},{"startMs":3839340,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"to think a metaphor that is probably has been immortalized to say that we think that life the"},{"startMs":3845880,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"origin of life is like saying that uh tornado blowing through a junkyard with all the bits"},{"startMs":3851940,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and pieces the Plastics and the screws and so on uh assembled fully working buoyance Boeing"},{"startMs":3858060,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"747 and we've gone a long way from Boeing 747s now but anyway that's that's the kind of improvement"},{"startMs":3865920,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"that when one has to cope with so it has to start somewhere if there was ever a beginning"},{"startMs":3871200,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"right and this is the question that uh is a deep philosophical question that depends on your"},{"startMs":3876840,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"personal point of view right uh the Babylonians would say there was no beginning the Indians"},{"startMs":3882540,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"would say there was no beginning and but the the Western tradition famous the beginning I think"},{"startMs":3889620,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"four reasons that are connected with theology after all I mean God created the universe God"},{"startMs":3896040,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"created the Earth God created life so there was in in in in the western canon in the Canon of

underlying"},{"startMs":3917640,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"philosophy that is non uh supported not supported by science which is the the story of Origins"},{"startMs":3930660,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"yeah I think it does yeah thank you so much so we have a few more questions unfortunately we're"},{"startMs":3938880,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"running out of time um but I will say that we're going to ask one more but um before we close with"},{"startMs":3944280,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"the last question um uh Chandra has agreed to join us in the social Lounge um so some of you"},{"startMs":3950340,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"will have opportunities maybe to ask directly once we are done with the session so the final question"},{"startMs":3955080,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"comes from the SSC secretary he asks at the end of your talk he said that if panspermia is accepted"},{"startMs":3960540,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"it would have major changes on Humanity can you elaborate on that and what makes you think that"},{"startMs":3965820,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"this knowledge would change Humanity well I think I think what would what would happen immediately"},{"startMs":3972120,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"is that scientific establishments universities and so on would would suddenly realize that"},{"startMs":3979860,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"they've got to teach a different story right the story that we are being told constantly for the"},{"startMs":3986160,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"last uh 50 years ever since universities and academies got very powerful was that there was"},{"startMs":3992880,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"no other alternative but a beginning of Life on the earth and that sort of gives"},{"startMs":4000440,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"human beings a very important position in this whole story humans are

we"},{"startMs":4030860,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"are not uh we are not anything special we are just the outcome of a process of cosmic Evolution and"},{"startMs":4039380,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"um and that's the reason that I think that we would become trivialized or we would"},{"startMs":4044480,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"feel
