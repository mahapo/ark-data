years"},{"startMs":1007600,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"that"},{"startMs":1008399,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":1009120,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"if you you can develop a sort of

it"},{"startMs":1485120,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"is it continues for"},{"startMs":1488320,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"indefinitely here's a plot showing

a"},{"startMs":1494240,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"depletion of any built-in charge"},{"startMs":1496960,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"so then we thought if this really

100"},{"startMs":1505520,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"microns on edge and yes the current does"},{"startMs":1508480,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"scale with area"},{"startMs":1510159,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"and we said well if this really works"},{"startMs":1512720,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"then if you built an array of

add"},{"startMs":1518400,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"up"},{"startMs":1519760,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and so so far we've built some small"},{"startMs":1522159,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"arrays"},{"startMs":1523360,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and we built them in two different

well"},{"startMs":1551919,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"maybe this is due to some pickup maybe"},{"startMs":1553840,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"there's pickup from

160"},{"startMs":1622320,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"years so that would mean we wouldn't see"},{"startMs":1624640,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"a continuous current but we do it's not"},{"startMs":1626960,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"cosmic rays well could it even be"},{"startMs":1629200,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"something exotic like neutrinos"},{"startMs":1631919,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"so neutrinos have a higher flux"},{"startMs":1634799,"durationMs":5921,"subtitle":"there we would end up with about four"},{"startMs":1637360,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"hits per second for our devices"},{"startMs":1640720,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"for the of the highest flux

it's"},{"startMs":1662480,"durationMs":5919,"subtitle":"not you due to neutrinos"},{"startMs":1665279,"durationMs":6081,"subtitle":"so this really looks like we are"},{"startMs":1668399,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"harvesting energy"},{"startMs":1671360,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"and so you think what what can we do"},{"startMs":1673840,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"with this energy"},{"startMs":1675679,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"so the way we've thought about

that"},{"startMs":1683520,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"don't run out"},{"startMs":1684799,"durationMs":5921,"subtitle":"so it's similar in cost to solar

higher"},{"startMs":1696720,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"power density"},{"startMs":1698960,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"uh so initially the goal is to
