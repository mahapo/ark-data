all"},{"startMs":392880,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"were seeing pairs of galaxies and and so"},{"startMs":396240,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"on they were imagining them

Bachelor"},{"startMs":2301599,"durationMs":4621,"subtitle":"students we looked through lots of stars"},{"startMs":2303520,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"and we found the candidate and then that"},{"startMs":2306220,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"was the problem that we had only"},{"startMs":2307300,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"explored one percent of the

data"},{"startMs":2333160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"so we started thinking about let's do a"},{"startMs":2335560,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"citizen science project we started"},{"startMs":2337000,"durationMs":6119,"subtitle":"working on the citizen science project"},{"startMs":2339460,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and we started there and that was like"},{"startMs":2343119,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"one or two years of setting up just a"},{"startMs":2345640,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"just the infrastructure then I got

right"},{"startMs":2364780,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"now like two or three years after he has"},{"startMs":2366820,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"submitted the paper because it was so"},{"startMs":2368920,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"difficult and so enormous amount of work"},{"startMs":2371880,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and this is just to identify the"},{"startMs":2374740,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"candidates and we're"},{"startMs":2376540,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"and with a citizen science project we"},{"startMs":2378460,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"have now collected all the data we need"},{"startMs":2380619,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"to do a preliminary data analysis so I"},{"startMs":2383800,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"think we will have the first the first"},{"startMs":2385599,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"phase might be completed by the end

years"},{"startMs":2399339,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"um I'm wondering do you think we could"},{"startMs":2402839,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"uh bring up I think or we'll be able to"},{"startMs":2406359,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"do this bring up the project the link"},{"startMs":2408280,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"that you shared and can you show us what"},{"startMs":2410140,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"it looks like to do a trial yes so let"},{"startMs":2413440,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"me uh open"},{"startMs":2417880,"durationMs":7100,"subtitle":"and so I have to share my screen somehow"},{"startMs":2421960,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"cross your fingers"},{"startMs":2427200,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"share screen"},{"startMs":2429579,"durationMs":2601,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":2433540,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"so I will do this stuff"},{"startMs":2436540,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"what does people see my"},{"startMs":2439000,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"the website"},{"startMs":2440440,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"yeah I see so this when you come to the"},{"startMs":2442900,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"website you come to a splash screen and"},{"startMs":2444640,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"then you can click here"},{"startMs":2446140,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and say okay so let me pick a more fun"},{"startMs":2449020,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"example this one is boring we have seen"},{"startMs":2452140,"durationMs":5699,"subtitle":"this several times so I will just do"},{"startMs":2453880,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"like randomly say the object is there so"},{"startMs":2457839,"durationMs":6061,"subtitle":"now you are going to find this a case"},{"startMs":2461140,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"when someone asks you to can like focus"},{"startMs":2463900,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"on the central object in the left image"},{"startMs":2465700,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"in this case is this one"},{"startMs":2468460,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"um has the star vanished or which option"},{"startMs":2470680,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"fits the best well in this case nothing"},{"startMs":2472839,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"has vanished because this is the typical"},{"startMs":2474700,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"artifact that you can find when you have"},{"startMs":2476320,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"a very bright star"},{"startMs":2478420,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"so no there's nothing fun here that one"},{"startMs":2481119,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"can have some fun with rotating images"},{"startMs":2482740,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":2484960,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":2485619,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"we see that here nothing has vanished"},{"startMs":2487660,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"the object is still there so you submit"},{"startMs":2490359,"durationMs":2361,"subtitle":"the case"},{"startMs":2493180,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"and you hope for that the next case will"},{"startMs":2495160,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"be somehow more fun right now it's uh"},{"startMs":2497520,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"like random Mission generator and but"},{"startMs":2502300,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"once the AI will be finally developed it"},{"startMs":2504640,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"will not be random anymore"},{"startMs":2506140,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"so here we have another case is there"},{"startMs":2508480,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"something interesting in this image so"},{"startMs":2510099,"durationMs":3721,"subtitle":"I'm sad to say that I don't see anything"},{"startMs":2511480,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"interesting but maybe I will go to the"},{"startMs":2513820,"durationMs":5519,"subtitle":"inspects just for fun and see if there"},{"startMs":2516460,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"might be something else"},{"startMs":2519339,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"I look here and I still don't see too"},{"startMs":2521920,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"much of fun stuff"},{"startMs":2523359,"durationMs":3421,"subtitle":"because you can look like in different"},{"startMs":2524920,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"bands"},{"startMs":2526780,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"um in the blue band in the Red Band here"},{"startMs":2529660,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"are all these images from the 50s or"},{"startMs":2531940,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"sorry 50s 80s"},{"startMs":2534280,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"and these are from the pan stars that"},{"startMs":2536260,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"it's like 2015. and let's say I see"},{"startMs":2539140,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"Santa Claus that I can write something"},{"startMs":2540579,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"here and I can submit it"},{"startMs":2542740,"durationMs":4099,"subtitle":"anyway I go back and I think not a very"},{"startMs":2545560,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"foundation"},{"startMs":2546839,"durationMs":6581,"subtitle":"and I do it again and in this way I

at"},{"startMs":2584740,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"the project now I need to stop sharing I"},{"startMs":2588339,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"can do that for you okay awesome all"},{"startMs":2591880,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"right um and and that has opened anybody"},{"startMs":2593859,"durationMs":3081,"subtitle":"who wants to participate right"},{"startMs":2596980,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"yes absolutely everyone"},{"startMs":2598800,"durationMs":4539,"subtitle":"can participate"},{"startMs":2601180,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"excellent excellent all right we have"},{"startMs":2603339,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"one more question from Robert he wants"},{"startMs":2605800,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"to know has halton's ARP quasars"},{"startMs":2608020,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"observations been explained"},{"startMs":2610480,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"I would say that they have been put"},{"startMs":2613060,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"under the carpets because people got"},{"startMs":2616060,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"tired of arguing about them and there"},{"startMs":2619540,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"was not a super consent so since
