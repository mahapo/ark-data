data"},{"startMs":1375120,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"um and this is sort of"},{"startMs":1377600,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"you know it's it's sort of sort of"},{"startMs":1379600,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"significant sort of in the noise we're"},{"startMs":1381520,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"not claiming the significance of this"},{"startMs":1383679,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"uh at this point but you see that"},{"startMs":1385760,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"there's this kind of interesting"},{"startMs":1386960,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"reversal"},{"startMs":1388799,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"that nighttime data has kind of an"},{"startMs":1390480,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"opposite character to date time data in"},{"startMs":1392080,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"a certain

the"},{"startMs":1413520,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"comparison there and then at night time"},{"startMs":1415520,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you get the reverse of that"},{"startMs":1417520,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"well i should say this is"},{"startMs":1419120,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"data before the winter solstice so i'm"},{"startMs":1421200,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"going to show you two plots two charts"},{"startMs":1423760,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"of six plots each before the

this"},{"startMs":1447039,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"this is in the same direction instead

thing"},{"startMs":1452480,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"like we don't know why what this is"},{"startMs":1453919,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"about but it seems like something to"},{"startMs":1456400,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"investigate further and here's the other"},{"startMs":1458400,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"plot"},{"startMs":1459840,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"showing that as well"},{"startMs":1462080,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"you can see here maybe there's some"},{"startMs":1465120,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"uh it's not quite reversed maybe there's"},{"startMs":1467039,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"a different frequency

up"},{"startMs":1478240,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1479520,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"this has been a replication and"},{"startMs":1481279,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"extension"},{"startMs":1483039,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1483919,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"the up the apparatus has been

the"},{"startMs":1518960,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"chat so i'm going to go through some of"},{"startMs":1521120,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"those questions and"},{"startMs":1522720,"durationMs":2319,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1523919,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"hopefully we can get through some of"},{"startMs":1525039,"durationMs":6321,"subtitle":"them in this time um let's see so the"},{"startMs":1528159,"durationMs":6561,"subtitle":"first question is about"},{"startMs":1531360,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"whether any of the variations in counts"},{"startMs":1534720,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"could be correlated with sun activity"},{"startMs":1536960,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"like sun spots or flares"},{"startMs":1538880,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1540400,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"yeah there's a slide here"},{"startMs":1542720,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"about um"},{"startMs":1544400,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"geomagnetic uh fluctuations right here"},{"startMs":1547840,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1548880,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"i haven't really looked at this but um"},{"startMs":1552159,"durationMs":2321,"subtitle":"there's"},{"startMs":1553039,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"that would be a good thing to look at"},{"startMs":1554480,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"yes"},{"startMs":1557120,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"could i add to that just briefly"},{"startMs":1559600,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"yes please um so the donald are there"},{"startMs":1562320,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"geometric magnetic or these are yeah"},{"startMs":1564559,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"these are geomagnetic field fluctuations"},{"startMs":1566480,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"with the seasons you know the earth is"},{"startMs":1568400,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"in this little spot in the middle"},{"startMs":1570720,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"and so clearly even within each season"},{"startMs":1573279,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"well not clearly because you can't see"},{"startMs":1574799,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"but the sun is over here"},{"startMs":1577200,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"i don't know if you can see my mouse um"},{"startMs":1579360,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"no can't see your mouse yeah the sun"},{"startMs":1581360,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"would be over here right exactly and so"},{"startMs":1584000,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"at night time that's flipped"},{"startMs":1586720,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"so this shows the seasonal"},{"startMs":1588880,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and by inference"},{"startMs":1590640,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"the day night difference so there could"},{"startMs":1592240,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"be a whole geomagnetic effect that could"},{"startMs":1594559,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"happen on the electrons in the

have"},{"startMs":1621039,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"i don't know what my plans are with this"},{"startMs":1622640,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"next exactly"},{"startMs":1623919,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"but that could be a good idea yeah yeah"},{"startMs":1627600,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"i would like to say like"},{"startMs":1629120,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"this we just discovered those very"},{"startMs":1630880,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"recently and that wasn't the main point"},{"startMs":1632799,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"but there's a lot of work to do"},{"startMs":1635440,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"yeah it's very

apart"},{"startMs":1653039,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"i don't know what the steep tips are"},{"startMs":1655120,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"um i i kept track of when i would go in"},{"startMs":1657760,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"the room to upload data and stuff like"},{"startMs":1659520,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"that or when i had the lights on there"},{"startMs":1661600,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"was one time where the lights got"},{"startMs":1663200,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"changed and so people other people

and"},{"startMs":1669679,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"that's not strong that you know maybe"},{"startMs":1671919,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"one of the things is due to that

that"},{"startMs":1901039,"durationMs":6161,"subtitle":"the random numbers in this experiment"},{"startMs":1903919,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"are selected once for the

concludes"},{"startMs":1914799,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"at that moment or not and then draw"},{"startMs":1917200,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"another random number to

yeah"},{"startMs":1928399,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"and there's some indications that if you"},{"startMs":1930399,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"don't choose a random duration in

all"},{"startMs":1944480,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"so it might be that there has to be
