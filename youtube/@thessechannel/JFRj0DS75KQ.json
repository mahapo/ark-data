a"},{"startMs":859120,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"sort of small application of that is"},{"startMs":861440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"that if you're doing a randomization

you"},{"startMs":874639,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"know it's it's not"},{"startMs":876240,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"you're not saying when to start creating"},{"startMs":878240,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"that string"},{"startMs":880240,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and the idea would be you know you"},{"startMs":881920,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"generally we don't think you can see"},{"startMs":883600,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"what's coming but maybe using psi you"},{"startMs":885760,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"can actually choose an arbitrary good"},{"startMs":887920,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"time to start so here's an uh example

your"},{"startMs":898720,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"randomization string at that point"},{"startMs":902160,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and that's the decision

that"},{"startMs":907760,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"maybe you can actually get a favorable"},{"startMs":909760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"random

these"},{"startMs":982480,"durationMs":5919,"subtitle":"assumptions actually might be wrong"},{"startMs":985600,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"okay so let's look at how a simple drug"},{"startMs":988399,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"versus placebo clinical trial works uh"},{"startMs":990639,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"somebody enrolls in the study"},{"startMs":993120,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"they're randomly assigned to receive"},{"startMs":994959,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"either the active drug or a

person"},{"startMs":1002560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and then those are compared for the two"},{"startMs":1004320,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"groups and then the conclusion is

of"},{"startMs":1015120,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"a good clinical trial the way we"},{"startMs":1017279,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"currently understand them the first one"},{"startMs":1019279,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"is the whole idea of having a placebo or"},{"startMs":1021120,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"a control group and the idea there is"},{"startMs":1023519,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"that participants are treated the same"},{"startMs":1025360,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"as those receiving the active treatment"},{"startMs":1027120,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"except they don't receive the

there"},{"startMs":1031280,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"are all kinds of other things that are"},{"startMs":1032559,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"going on in the background you

well"},{"startMs":1038079,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"that sort of thing so you want everybody"},{"startMs":1040079,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"to be treated the same for everything"},{"startMs":1042000,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"else except that one group's getting the"},{"startMs":1043760,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"drug and the other group is not so"},{"startMs":1045839,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"that's why that's done"},{"startMs":1048559,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"um okay random assignment is another"},{"startMs":1050880,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"feature and what is it well the"},{"startMs":1053280,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"treatments are randomly assigned to the"},{"startMs":1054799,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"participants who gets which treatment"},{"startMs":1057200,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you know the medical practitioner

let's"},{"startMs":1062720,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"give him the drug and so on and again"},{"startMs":1065600,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"the purpose is to balance out what

what"},{"startMs":1071280,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"their diet's like their general health"},{"startMs":1073120,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and so on so you want those to be"},{"startMs":1074640,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"approximately equal across the groups"},{"startMs":1077440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and the idea is that if you use random"},{"startMs":1079600,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"assignment that will in fact be what"},{"startMs":1082080,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"happens"},{"startMs":1083919,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"all right three blind or double blind
