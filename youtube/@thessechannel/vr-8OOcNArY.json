the"},{"startMs":466080,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"idea that we wanted to follow"},{"startMs":469380,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"so we did this by partnering up with an"},{"startMs":471780,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"ongoing workshop I'll describe the"},{"startMs":474000,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"workshop a bit basically we

intensive"},{"startMs":523620,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"trainings you know up to six eight six"},{"startMs":526380,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"or eight hours a day and in between the"},{"startMs":528660,"durationMs":4739,"subtitle":"sessions there was homework of course"},{"startMs":531720,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"um there was also nighttime homework

from Charlie"},{"startMs":567420,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and Morley in this case was to seek"},{"startMs":570180,"durationMs":5219,"subtitle":"reconciliation that was the goal"},{"startMs":572700,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"um instead of fighting or or fleeing"},{"startMs":575399,"durationMs":3721,"subtitle":"we had a psychotherapist that was

the"},{"startMs":579120,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"sessions"},{"startMs":580860,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"um and also in between sessions James"},{"startMs":583440,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"scary is a wonderful guy"},{"startMs":586800,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"so our participants we ended up"},{"startMs":589140,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"recruiting almost 50 adults all"},{"startMs":592560,"durationMs":5219,"subtitle":"experiencing PTSD many of them

48."},{"startMs":604560,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"um mainly you know majority of them were"},{"startMs":606959,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"female majority of them are white

have"},{"startMs":1237440,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"a healing lucid dream and so it took the"},{"startMs":1239360,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"saliva collected on on the day
