that's"},{"startMs":1854059,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"actually what we have in mind at Monroe"},{"startMs":1856940,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"is if we can get this uh

50"},{"startMs":2710560,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"to 55 percent"},{"startMs":2712359,"durationMs":5341,"subtitle":"and uh no we could still see

that"},{"startMs":2785800,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"so they had the four walls up and down"},{"startMs":2788560,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"front and back and the fifth measure

guys"},{"startMs":2805060,"durationMs":7559,"subtitle":"recommended going forward is the better"},{"startMs":2809619,"durationMs":4761,"subtitle":"measurement would be to have four"},{"startMs":2812619,"durationMs":6421,"subtitle":"electrometers"},{"startMs":2814380,"durationMs":7060,"subtitle":"uh one one on the earlobe I think one on"},{"startMs":2819040,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"the solar plexus one on the tontian and"},{"startMs":2821440,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"one on the ankles something like that"},{"startMs":2823720,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"they wanted a measure up and down the"},{"startMs":2826180,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"body"},{"startMs":2827079,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"so they could get a a slightly better"},{"startMs":2830319,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"way of"},{"startMs":2832060,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"you know seeing that dipole effect"},{"startMs":2835319,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"but"},{"startMs":2836859,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"you know by measuring in the walls you"},{"startMs":2839200,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"are seeing the the sort of radiative"},{"startMs":2841000,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"electric field and there was some"},{"startMs":2842800,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"interesting things about that is again"},{"startMs":2844300,"durationMs":5819,"subtitle":"Professor Moga was pointing out in

that"},{"startMs":2852339,"durationMs":4441,"subtitle":"you see on the metal walls"},{"startMs":2855220,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"um so there's something interesting with"},{"startMs":2856780,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"that going on and uh"},{"startMs":2859720,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"the other thing is the tiller and green"},{"startMs":2862780,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"paper they were really recommending"},{"startMs":2864940,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"adding magnetic field measure"},{"startMs":2867579,"durationMs":5881,"subtitle":"to this so you know the optimal would be"},{"startMs":2870700,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"to have a magnetometer like Professor"},{"startMs":2873460,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"Moga is using in the copper wall and and"},{"startMs":2876460,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and see you know if those kind of"},{"startMs":2879160,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"magnetic fields are popping up when"},{"startMs":2880660,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"we're seeing the wild stuff going on"},{"startMs":2882160,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"with the electrostatic"},{"startMs":2884380,"durationMs":4979,"subtitle":"right okay so um more questions incoming"},{"startMs":2887380,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"work I think the shielding"},{"startMs":2889359,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"um John McDonald is asking uh have you"},{"startMs":2891700,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"tested the copper wall room without"},{"startMs":2893140,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"anyone in it and a follow-up why not"},{"startMs":2897040,"durationMs":3779,"subtitle":"have a favorite vacation you left two"},{"startMs":2898960,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"walls off"},{"startMs":2900819,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"yeah the answer to the first one is yes"},{"startMs":2903160,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"uh like I was mentioning I did maybe two"},{"startMs":2906640,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"and a half months of"},{"startMs":2908200,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"almost 24 7 continuous running"},{"startMs":2911980,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"with nobody in the room and the uh"},{"startMs":2915280,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"the conductive connector we're using"},{"startMs":2917260,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"just sitting on top of the bar stool in"},{"startMs":2919540,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"the in the copper wall room"},{"startMs":2921880,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"I'm looking to see what you get nobody"},{"startMs":2925060,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"there and uh like I mentioned we it was"},{"startMs":2928540,"durationMs":4579,"subtitle":"very stable"},{"startMs":2929859,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"very low drift clouds didn't affect it"},{"startMs":2933119,"durationMs":5561,"subtitle":"lightning would affect the AC reading so"},{"startMs":2935859,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"you know don't do measurements when"},{"startMs":2938680,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"there's a lightning storm lurking around"},{"startMs":2940359,"durationMs":5941,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":2942880,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"excuse me good advice yeah yeah"},{"startMs":2946300,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"um oh I could tell you stories never"},{"startMs":2947740,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"mind"},{"startMs":2948819,"durationMs":4861,"subtitle":"um why not have a faraday cage I don't"},{"startMs":2951819,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"think you really need it"},{"startMs":2953680,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"okay I think the shielding on those four"},{"startMs":2956079,"durationMs":3181,"subtitle":"walls"},{"startMs":2957220,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"cuts down the AC"},{"startMs":2959260,"durationMs":6359,"subtitle":"induced power line interference"},{"startMs":2961660,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"considerably you know we've got to have"},{"startMs":2965619,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"some opening that Booth is pretty small"},{"startMs":2967420,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"I think it might make people a little"},{"startMs":2969220,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"claustrophobic to have the four walls"},{"startMs":2970900,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"all closed in on them and you know you"},{"startMs":2972819,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"don't think you really need it"},{"startMs":2974440,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":2975940,"durationMs":5159,"subtitle":"okay thank you very much so um we have"},{"startMs":2978280,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"another two questions over here uh"},{"startMs":2981099,"durationMs":5701,"subtitle":"yeah so um have you or you know question"},{"startMs":2984400,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"uh anyone you knew or any research you"},{"startMs":2986800,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"knew has considered any measurements for"},{"startMs":2989280,"durationMs":4839,"subtitle":"Ionic changes may not be possible for"},{"startMs":2992260,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"the current setup or the follow-up setup"},{"startMs":2994119,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"that you're planning"},{"startMs":2995859,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"uh so I think if I'm interpreting this"},{"startMs":2999579,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"right uh ionic current flow in the body"},{"startMs":3004260,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"um must be what you're talking about I"},{"startMs":3006420,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"don't think it is possible in our"},{"startMs":3008220,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"current setup and I'm not exactly sure"},{"startMs":3011280,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"how you might do that"},{"startMs":3013560,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"the answer is yes that the"},{"startMs":3016980,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":3018720,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"so yeah ionic description that you"},{"startMs":3020579,"durationMs":2461,"subtitle":"mentioned"},{"startMs":3021960,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"yeah"},{"startMs":3023040,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"if I'd be curious to know a person will"},{"startMs":3025920,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"propose to do that kind of measure"},{"startMs":3028140,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"okay we'll wait for some proposals uh"},{"startMs":3030540,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"then it sounds interesting and uh here's"},{"startMs":3033720,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"another question by Robert by Professor"},{"startMs":3035460,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"Robert Patterson"},{"startMs":3037200,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"um so you mentioned before that you saw"},{"startMs":3039599,"durationMs":8401,"subtitle":"70 volts on the year with grounded"},{"startMs":3042420,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"wrists no no paper right this this was"},{"startMs":3048000,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"uh the 70 volts that was measured on the"},{"startMs":3050700,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"air with one connection to the body no"},{"startMs":3053640,"durationMs":4979,"subtitle":"other connection to the body"},{"startMs":3055800,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"so the the body itself is not grounded"},{"startMs":3058619,"durationMs":4261,"subtitle":"anywhere it's floating"},{"startMs":3061020,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"the other side of the electrometer is"},{"startMs":3062880,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"connected to Earth ground"},{"startMs":3066000,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"okay so what you have is an electrically"},{"startMs":3068520,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"isolated person they're on top of an"},{"startMs":3071220,"durationMs":2399,"subtitle":"insulating"},{"startMs":3072540,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"floor"},{"startMs":3073619,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"we're trying to cut down

one"},{"startMs":3080579,"durationMs":6301,"subtitle":"measure on their ear"},{"startMs":3083940,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"okay relative to Earth ground that's the"},{"startMs":3086880,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"way it was done"},{"startMs":3088859,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"okay so I think this uh leads us to the"},{"startMs":3091920,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"end of the of the session and for that"},{"startMs":3094079,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"for the Symposium so um uh thank you"},{"startMs":3097740,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"again Dr doncet for that wonderful"},{"startMs":3099300,"durationMs":5299,"subtitle":"presentation and all the uh
