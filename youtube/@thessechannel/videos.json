Life, as with all chemical reactions, has an underlying quantum mechanical basis at the atomic level. The developing science of Quantum Biology shows that biochemical activity has an underlying quantum mechanism.  The recent advent of quantum computers has defined a mechanism for quantum computation that may help provide an understanding of the complex science underlying life and consciousness.  Consciousness research from the likes of Hameroff and Penrose provides a theoretical quantum basis for understanding consciousness. Other researchers have proposed that the whole living system is essentially a quantum computer. The concept of quantum entanglement is essentially the generation of a system that creates a stored memory that can be measured or recalled. Quantum entanglement is used for storing encrypted codes. Memory is stored recallable information that is necessary for a living system.  Entanglement is non-localized information and even exists out of time and offers an explanation of how memory can be stored through time.  All the bio-molecular components of life are a physical memory for a functional operation like hardware in a computer.  However, the complexity of bio-molecules within a living cellular organism presents a difficult problem for coordinating simple kinetic interactivity to create emergent life properties. Having an entangled memory of these interactions could create a template for organizing and coordinating these interactions, even possibly forming non-local and non-kinetic emergent activity at the molecular level. This entanglement of biological memory is like the software that resembles Sheldrake’s Morphic Resonance for the physical bio-molecular hardware. Although it is thought to be difficult in the cellular environment it is possible that this entangled bio-molecular memory can be generated by the resultant thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the functional system operation in the cell.\n\nThe quantum memory imprints the physical emergent functional operation. Michael Levin describes an emergent bioelectric current that coordinates cellular morphogenesis. This bioelectric current allows cells to communicate in a higher order top-down emergent state controlling the overall development of the organism. This electric wave functions in the physical plane as the quantum entanglement memory functions in the quantum plane. These bioelectric wave functions are seen in the brain forming complex (EGG) patterns that, in a similar manner to cell development, generate the emergent bio-electric functions associated with consciousness.\n\nThe physical biochemical reactions in a living system involve energy, and entropic transformation serves to imprint the quantum entangled information. The interactions at the interface between the quantum/classical biophysical systems create the complex emergent intelligent processes of life.  This interface between the quantum information memory space and the biophysical material plane is the life force or Chi. The Chi lifeforce is the meeting point for the biophysical material “hardware” and the quantum entangled informational memory “software”.\n\nScott Marcus Koshland has a Bachelor of Science degree in biological and chemical sciences and studied neurophysiology at UC Berkeley.

Arnold","description":"Sidereal Period Calculated with the Earth’s Forward Speed Around the Sun as a Proposed Theory of UAP Speed\nEdward R. Arnold\n\nRecent videos and sightings of unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) have spurned the creation of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force to standardize the collection and reporting of sightings of unexplained aerial vehicles previously termed unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The recent reports concentrate on the perception of observers of the object’s speed viewed in excess of 13,000 (mph) and observations of maneuvers that appear to contradict known laws of physics. Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Spatial Distancing is a theory that is a reverse to which the basic concept is the UAP is not moving the observers of the UAP are moving. In this concept of speed, the consensus is the object is using a form of antigravity based on observations that the objects have no known method of propulsion. The objects have been observed to hover and then move at tremendous speeds to which, in a matter of seconds, they are out of physical visual sight and electronic surveillance. The perception of the observers is that the objects moved upward toward space.\n\nThis perception of the UAP moving upward may be accurate as the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Spatial Distancing theory is based on the movement of the Earth related to the Earth’s sidereal rotation and the Earth’s solar rotation. These two rotations are known mathematically as the Earth rotates on its axis at a speed of 1,037 (mph). The Earth is moving through space in a solar orbit at a speed of 67,000 (mph).\n\nSidereal time is a time scale based on the Earth's rate of rotation, and this scale can be used to determine the potential speed of UAP related to an application of gravity. In essence, a person is moving within the Earth’s sidereal motion at a speed of 5 football fields per second, and a person is moving within the Earth’s solar rotation at a speed of 327 football fields per second. The Earth’s solar rotation or the Earth’s velocity around the Sun is shown as g = m/s2 = x g on the Earth’s surface v = m/s= km/h= mi/h.\n\nThe two speeds are constant and affect everything on the planet to which a person physically located in the state of Indiana, USA is traveling, through time and space, at the same speed as a person physically located in the countries of: France; Japan; India; Egypt or Russia. In this concept, the person is not aware of the Earth’s rotation speeds, and the person’s perception is that they are standing still.\n\nIn this theory, there are two speeds and two directions. The theory was first proposed in the year 1970 and is not without support as Albert Einstein proposed that a person’s perception of time and space is dependent on where they are relative to the object being observed. Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Spatial Distancing theory is based on the Earth’s sidereal rotation speed multiplied times the observation time (UAPS1 = ESR * OT) and the Earth’s solar forward rotation speed multiplied times the observation time (UAPS2 = ESFR * OT).\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA/join\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

To address this barrier, we need novel models to study psi that will enhance the detection and replication of psi effects.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Henri Bergson postulated that the nervous system inhibits psychic abilities and that deficits in this inhibitory mechanism may lead to the emergence of psi phenomena. To expand on Bergson’s concept, we postulated that psi inhibition by the brain involves the frontal lobes. To test this hypothesis, we studied individuals with neurological damage affecting their frontal lobes and found that the left medial middle frontal region involving Brodmann areas 9, 10, and 32 may act as a biological filter to inhibit psi. This was based on identifying the areas of lesion overlap in the individuals studied. The experimental task was to influence the output of a Random Event Generator (REG) translated into the movement of an arrow on a computer screen to the right or left. Compared to a well-designed control condition, individuals with frontal lesions demonstrated a significant effect in moving the arrow contralateral to the side of their primary lesion overlap, i.e., to the right. However, these findings were based on two cases. We now report findings from a study of 108 participants using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We confirmed our a priori hypothesis that healthy participants with reversible rTMS-induced lesions affecting the left medial middle frontal region would show larger right intention psi effects on a mind-matter interaction task compared to healthy participants without rTMS-induced lesions.\n\nMethods: We studied mind-matter interactions in healthy participants (n=108). There were three groups: rTMS-induced lesions in the left medial middle frontal region (n=36), rTMS-induced lesions in the right medial middle frontal region (n=36), and sham stimulation (n=36). For the mind-matter interaction task, participants were asked to try to influence the output of a REG that was translated into the movement of an arrow on a computer screen to the right or left.\n\nResults\n\nIn support of our a priori hypothesis, we found significant psi effects following rTMS inhibition of the left medial middle frontal lobe compared to sham stimulation when trying to move the arrow on the computer screen to the right ( = -0.17, LCL = -0.29, UCL = -0.05, t = -2.80, p = 0.006, d = 0.38).\n\nImplications / Discussion:\n\nOur study represents the fourth replication by our group of the finding that disruption of the left medial middle frontal region can increase the influence of the human brain on seemingly random events. This supports the concept that the brain acts as a psi-inhibitory filter. Our research suggests that individuals with frontal lesions may comprise an enriched sample for detecting and replicating psi effects. Our findings are potentially transformative for the way we view interactions between the brain and psi.\n\nBio: Morris Freedman is Head of Neurology and Medical Director, Austin Centre for Neurology and Behavioral Support at Baycrest Health Sciences.

Schwartz\n\nIntroduction: This is a preliminary report on a 45-year-long ongoing project using precognitive remote viewing to describe the future. For almost 50 years, information derived nonlocally through the use of established remote viewing protocols has provided pragmatically useful information. The Research Director of this project, Stephan Schwartz, developed and employed a protocol using multiple viewers, the Mobius Consensus Protocol, and concept-by-concept accuracy analysis by independent experts. It resulted in the discovery of archaeological sites both terrestrial and marine throughout the world.\n\nMethods: In Phase One of this project from 1991 to 1996, we focused on the sessions in the year 2050. We entered 538 remote viewings done using the monitored interview protocol. In Phase Two of the project, which began in 2018, we shifted to the year 2060 in order to compare the differences reported in 2050 and 2060. For the 2060 Populations Phase Two we conducted in-person or Skype remote-viewing sessions with 300 respondents and allowed another 1,000 individuals to respond using remote viewing on Survey Monkey questionnaires. After all concepts of all viewers were transcribed and broken down into alphanumerical identified concepts, an analysis was done establishing consensus within the data, both verbal and drawings, as well as whether an observation is low a priori.\n\nResults: A selection of preliminary observations about the future\n\nThe 1978 to 1991 viewers predicted:\n\n· the disappearance of the Soviet Union\n\n· the catastrophic rise of climate change\n\n· the rise of terrorism\n\n· the AIDs epidemic\n\n· the transition out of the carbon energy era\n\n· the development of virtual reality\n\nBeginning later in 1991, funded by Atlantic University and continuing through 1996, a second phase of the study began, involving not just personal sessions:\n\n· the inundation and collapse of American coastal cities\n\n· the creation of electric-powered commercial aircraft\n\n· the rise of the cashless society in which biometrics vouchsafe payment\n\nIn 2018, with funding from the BIAL Fundaçåo and Atlantic University, a third phase of this research was begun involving very specific populations and is now ongoing. A preliminary survey of the 2060 data reveals certain notable trends:\n\n· Between 2040 and 2045 several very dramatic changes alter the structure of human culture worldwide. It is not yet clear what they are, but two candidates seem to be climate change and the end of the carbon energy era, which will have major technological and geopolitical implications.\n\n· Climate change and the associated sea rise have caused the submergence of many coastal cities and subsequent massive internal and international migrations for which much of the world is notably ill-prepared.\n\n· People have largely reorganized into small communities.\n\n· The United States still exists at least in form, but real political power has devolved to states and regions, because of the radically different way in which states have planned for and accommodated climate change and these migrations.\n\n· In the U.S. the illness profit system of healthcare seems to have given way to universal birthright single-payer healthcare, much more like the present European model.\n\nBio: Stephan A.

We have data, evidence, studies, and transcripts that show that it works -- a lot of the time. Could RV work more of the time if we could better understand how a remote viewer senses it? I’ve had beginner’s luck and major slumps. I’ll show you some hits and misses. I’m trying to get more hits and fewer misses.\n\nIt’s accepted that most remote viewers experience beginner’s luck and then settle into a batting average. My first session of RV, I didn’t know what I was doing. I thought, “What the heck? Let’s give it a try.” When Garret Moddel learned that I was a good hypnosis subject, he had a hunch. He explained RV to me in a few minutes. I got three targets, and I got three home runs. I was batting 1000.\n\nBut like baseball, RV is full of vicissitudes. My next at-bats were kinda-hits and a bunch of strikeouts. Right away, my challenge became consistency. That’s confusing and frustrating. And it is also exciting, because I’m committed. The next home run can happen the next time I’m up. But how do I prepare myself to get a hit?\n\nI’m a former competitive swimmer. I trained for RV like an athlete. Practice more, get coached, work hard. I took RV classes, read books and papers, sought advice, and I still practice yoga and meditation. I learned several RV methods, but inconsistency remains.\n\nI understand that even the best achievers fail. It’s part of the game. I study my own sessions to derive some inkling of what works for me. What did the hit feel like on the way to getting the target right? What did the kinda-hit or miss feel like? Are there any clues in my confidence or stress levels? I’ll share those transcripts and how they felt.\n\nPerhaps we need a better way to decipher a hit in RV. The judging is tricky and often subjective. The best hitters in baseball average 3 out of 10. Ty Cobb holds the record with .366. If remote viewers get hits 3.5 times out of 10 attempts (and many do better than that), then mainstream science should finally agree that psi is valid. Personally, like in baseball, I believe there’s value in the base hits of RV, and the home runs.\n\nI’m seeking to bring beginner’s luck every time I go to bat. If I’m open and willing, can I capture a beginner’s mind anytime? Maybe the fluctuations aren’t always due to my ability. Is the psychic force a steady stream or does it wane? Maybe the psychic pitcher throws curveballs?\n\nPerhaps the magic of beginner’s luck is whimsy, unawareness, just swinging for the fences with no preconceived notions. Simply describe the first thing that pops into mind. I’m curious. I love to have the image surprise me. Sometimes it works. Like hitting a small round object coming at you at 100 mph with a wooden stick less than 3 inches wide.\n\nLyrysa Smith is an award-winning journalist and documentary filmmaker, having worked at ABC News, PBS, A&E, the History Channel, and others, and recently a caregiver.

Following their interpretation of Hume, they typically argue that, because the findings on psi must be viewed as violations of the laws of nature, the most likely interpretation is the presence of questionable research methods or fraud. For a number of reasons, I argue that the psi critics who use Hume in this way have misunderstood his arguments and that his famous chapter concerning miracles does not offer the resources to dismiss the psi data.  First, the target of Hume’s essay was miracles of religious nature, not reports of anomalous findings under laboratory conditions.  Second, I discuss that Hume’s arguments on the nature of causality, from other areas of his work, do not support the sorts of “laws” that psi skeptics have in mind.  Essentially, Hume’s arguments show that we cannot characterize causal relationships as deterministic or mathematical “laws.”  Instead, Hume argues that the world’s causal relationships must be described only in terms of regularities.  Another key problem for psi critics is that their core arguments generally hinge on establishing principles from a particular domain of inquiry in order to constrain or limit allowable findings in different domain that may have different characteristics and properties.  However, Hume’s analysis of causality does not allow us to establish such limiting principles that can be used to a priori dismiss evidence gathered under different conditions from such principles. In addition, I argue that, apart from Hume’s thinking, we should be wary of such limiting principles, given the context dependency of many causal relationships.  After showing that Hume’s arguments do not possess the resources to dismiss the psi data, I argue that it is extremely unlikely that the psi data could be the result of some combination of fraud and questionable research methods and thus merit serious attention.\n\nFurther, I also consider how Hume’s arguments linking our understanding of the world’s causal nature with custom and sentiment support a more institutional understanding of science than what is commonly understood, where habits of thought and emotion likely play a large role.  This more institutional view of science fits Thomas Kuhn’s framework that describes scientific practice in terms of paradigms. I then turn to how we might understand the debate around psi might be characterized through Kuhn’s notion of paradigms and Hume’s emphasis on habitual thought and sentiment.\n\nGeorge Williams works as an economist at the Federal Communications Commission.  However, as an independent scholar, he is focused on the implications of the psi literature on the philosophy of mind and philosophy of physics.Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA/join\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Shin\n\nTai Chi-a thousand-year-old Chinese martial art-is garnering global attention as an inexpensive and easy-to-implement treatment for chronic disease, pain, mental health, and cognitive decline. In addition, because it involves gentle movements, Tai Chi can be practiced by people of all ages. Tai Chi health benefits have been explained primarily in terms of psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms that emphasize calm mental states and the advantages of aerobic exercise. I will discuss some limitations of this approach and propose an alternative approach that focuses on the use of Eastern Medicine and Taoist principles to analyze Tai Chi movements and its practice methods. Such an approach would complement Western medical theories in predicting Tai Chi health outcomes, facilitating the development of Tai Chi treatments tailored to specific health issues or target populations, and maximize the health benefits of existing Tai Chi routines.\n\nJacqueline C.

Some maverick findings have turned out to be valid, and some not. How can we know when to trust the experts or when to take the maverick assertions seriously? For years, as a maverick scientist, I have planned to make a presentation called “Experts Aren’t.” With increasingly authoritative sounding but unsupported conclusions on the internet and from artificial intelligence (AI) systems, I have reevaluated this plan. No matter your perspective, you are likely to disagree with at least some of my observations about this perpetually controversial issue.\n\nWhat follows are a smattering of maverick science findings, including valid and invalid claims (three were presented by the mavericks at SSE conferences):\n\n·       The notion that X-rays are longitudinal waves (extended to the notion of scalar waves) by Nikola Tesla (1896) was and still is rejected by the mainstream electromagnetics community.\n\n·       Positive results of control studies showing the existence of extrasensory perception (ESP) by J. B. Rhine (1931) have not been replicated according to the mainstream scientific community (which neglects to cite the vast psi literature providing many replications).\n\n·       Perpetual motion in John Bedini’s free energy motor powered by a battery charged by charge spikes (1984) is supported by an extensive free energy movement but ignored by the mainstream.\n\n·       Cold fusion, now termed low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR), as reported by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann (1989), is still being dismissed by a skeptical mainstream scientific community.\n\n·       Findings that cosmic redshift is not the result of an expanding universe, which is consistent with the Big Bang, was found by Halton Arp (1998) but discarded by mainstream cosmologists.\n\n·       The assertion that gravity propagates much faster than light by Tom Van Flandern (1998), with current support by the Electric Universe community, has been rejected by mainstream cosmologists.\n\n·       An innovative scale-expanding theory explaining the apparent age of the Universe and other observations by Johan Masreliez (2004) has been completely ignored by mainstream cosmologists.\n\n·       Halting Alzheimer’s disease with lithium microdoses reported by Marielza Nunes et al. (2013) is reported much less than drug cures that are not nearly as effective.\n\n·       A clear violation of the second law of thermodynamics using epicatalysis demonstrated by Daniel Sheehan (2014) is ignored by the mainstream thermodynamics community.\n\nExamining these maverick findings, how can we distinguish authoritative-sounding but baseless claims from valid ones? Is the use of quantitative/mathematically-based modeling and predictions just a way for experts to show off their skills and suppress dissent? (No.) Can common sense be our guide? (Unfortunately, not.) Is “debunking” and mocking opposing views appropriate? (Of course not.) And has the shunning of maverick science suppressed scientific advancement, or are a lot of amateur researchers and inventors fooling themselves? (Yep, and yep.) I present a set of protocols for evaluating maverick science to resolve these questions.\n\nGarret Moddel is a professor of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado.

The “energy” in energy medicine implies a life force rather than a conventional physics definition, and many people feel they can perceive this energy through extended perception beyond their traditional five senses.\n\nMethods: This study evaluated clairvoyant perception during Reiki energy medicine sessions. Six expert Reiki Masters gave 30-minute sessions to 40 participants. Participants had one or more of the following conditions: acute physical injury (such as broken bone), mental impairment (memory issues), and psychological symptoms (anxiety and/or depression). Six people vetted for clairvoyant perception made observations before, during, and after sessions using quantitative and qualitative measures. Participants and Reiki Masters also recorded their observations. Data were analyzed for corroboration: 1) within-seers, 2) between the Reiki Master and seers, 3) between the participant and Reiki Master, and 4) between the participant and seers. Participants’ well-being outcomes and potential predictors were also evaluated.\n\nDiscussion: Participants’ well-being improved from a 30-minute Reiki session, maintaining improvements one week later. There was evidence from multiple data and analyses that seers observe similar information during Reiki sessions. Furthermore, there was correspondence between the seers’ observations of the participants’ health condition and participants’ self-reported health. Future studies are needed to refine the methods developed here to continue the exploration of extended perception, including its validity and its practical application in healthcare.Support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This shredding of the social contract protecting diplomacy shocked the world, and the hours around the explosions became the first formal event monitored by the Global Consciousness Project (GCP). Over the next 17 years 500 rigorously specified tests were made of the GCP’s general hypothesis that major events on the world stage would correspond to detectable changes in the data from our network of dozens of random number generators (RNG). \n\nWe looked at a variety of different categories of events, allowing some analysis of what characteristics seemed most conducive to the correlations found in the data apparently linked to the shared thoughts and emotions of people around the world. The overall effect size in the formal data is about one-third of a standard deviation, but over the 500 replications of the hypothesis test, this modest difference accumulates to a 7-sigma departure from expectation, and trillion-to-one odds against chance fluctuation as an explanation. This strong finding provides a basis for deeper examination of the data both to understand better how the effects arise, as well as to develop interpretations and applications.\n\nWe will consider several recent assessments of possible correlations of GCP data with external variables that are independent of the event-based analyses of the original project. These new analyses use a variety of methods including time-series, correlational, and multi-scale entropy analysis.\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Nelson","description":"Roger Nelson discovered patterns in GCP data that resemble patterns of evoked potentials in human brains. (2020) In both cases there is a stimulating event that is linked to a characteristic response. A flash of light evokes a response in noisy data from the occipital cortex: a time-locked signal average across many flash repetitions shows a large voltage peak preceded and followed by a smaller peak of opposite sign. In a similar manner, powerfully engaging events on the world stage apparently evoke deviations in GCP data. Signal averaging and smoothing reveal the same pattern as the brain evoked response: a large peak surrounded by smaller peaks of opposite sign. \n\nSeveral analyses, independent of the originally specified procedures, yield interesting and robust correlation or covariance measures linked to variations in GCP data. There are potentially predictive relationships between GCP data and stock market valuation shifts, and we also can see significant correlation of GCP data to high-usage Google search terms. We find evidence that data from the GCP network varies in its calculated entropy: the data are not fully entropic, and instead show structure (negentropy) in multi-scaled entropy measures. Finally, the network appears to respond to stimulating events (disasters, celebrations) as if they were stimuli to the senses of a global mind (or at least, stimuli modulating the coherent attention of huge numbers of people). Visualized using standard brain wave processing tools, the GCP network response typically shows a characteristic pattern that parallels human brain evoked responses, albeit on a vastly different temporal scale.\n\nDiscussion: The desire to explain data like those from the GCP leads to suggestive theories or models. One candidate is a “consciousness field” that can be modeled as an information field sourced in the mass of attentive human beings and focused by world events. Another candidate theory is a kind of observational model in which the experimenter(s) are the source of the psi effect, using precognition of future states of the data to enable opportune specification of test events.

Recent investigations of lucid dreaming suggest that this unique form of dreaming may be especially useful for promoting healing due to the lucid dreamer’s capacity for goal-directed action in the dream. The objectives of this pilot study were to\ndetermine the feasibility of studying healing lucid dreams for people with PTSD and to gather relevant preliminary data.\n\nMethods: Following a one-group, pretest-posttest research design, participants were recruited to experience an online healing lucid dreaming workshop. Of 144 adults experiencing chronic symptoms of PTSD who were screened, 49 completed the workshop from their homes in six different countries. The workshop consisted of 22 hours of live teaching via video conferencing spread, over six days, with curriculum including sleep hygiene principles, guided meditations, yoga Nidra, dream sharing circles, lucid dream exercises, dream planning lessons, and multiple lucid dreaming induction techniques. Outcome measures were collected before, during, and immediately after the workshop, as well as one month later. The primary outcome measure was self-reported PTSD symptom severity, as measured using the standardized PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Secondary outcomes included the degree of distress caused by nightmares measured using the Nightmare Experience Scale (NexS; Kelly et al., 2019), overall well-being using the Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale, and positive and negative emotions using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Salivary alpha-amylase levels were assessed as an exploratory measure with four of the participants who collected saliva samples each morning.\n\nDiscussion: The finding that participants experienced clinically significant and persistent relief from symptoms of PTSD, including reduced experiences of distressing nightmares,  confirms the feasibility of studying the healing power of lucid dreaming. Further confirmation of feasibility is provided by the finding that a majority of the participants in the study who achieved lucidity were also able to remember their dream plans for healing in the lucid dreamscape. Future studies are warranted that incorporate experimental conditions designed to distinguish effects unique to dream lucidity and to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the health benefits experienced following healing lucid dreams.\n\nReference\nKelly, W., & Mathe, J.

Obtaining neurological and physiological correlates of success in psi tasks is desirable for showing psi is meaningfully related to other measurable phenomena rather than just a free-floating anomaly.

For typical neuroimaging protocols requiring repeated relatively short \"trials\" interspersed with rest periods, a useable PK sensor must provide a reasonable signal to noise ratio, not interfere with the physiological instrumentation, and present an attractive well-defined target for the PK agent with the potential for immediate feedback. This study is an evaluation of a multivariate PK sensor designed for use in neuroimaging studies, run with groups and individuals attempting to influence the sensor in a timed protocol.\n\nMethods: A sensor system consisting of multiple channels in an electromagnetically-shielded enclosure connected to a laptop computer was presented to MC Squared program participants at the Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia. Each sensor provided three outputs regarding localized air ionization events from cosmic ray sources. Participants were provided with a basic description of the target and asked to make the score shown on the real time laptop display go higher. Attempts at PK were timed at 120 seconds, with 135 second baseline periods in between. Both groups and individuals were offered opportunities to engage the sensor. One hundred and twelve participants from ten MC Squared programs participated in the study over a period of three years.\nResults: Sensor outputs were significantly different (higher) during PK attempts vs. baselines. Simple scoring of sensor outputs was based on event counts (effect size 0.07, p = 0.02) that are relatively easy to detect and discriminate from artifact with automated scoring. However, each event also has two analog measures, magnitude, and velocity, and when these are combined in Manova the results are considerably more significant, p = 0.009. Additional information from the sensor is available in the timing of events in clusters. Cluster counts were much lower than event counts, and all baseline clusters were composed of two events only. In contrast, PK clusters were not only more numerous but also had multiple events. Weighted cluster scores, taking into account multiple events, were 70 for PK vs. 32 for baseline.\n\nDiscussion: This was an evaluation of a novel PK sensor for potential use in neuroimaging PK studies. The sensor detects air ionization events primarily from Muons (similar to electrons) arriving at the surface of the earth from cosmic ray sources. Previous studies using Geiger counters (Radin, 1993) and other types of radiation detectors (Yan et al., 2002) have shown apparent human intention effects regarding high energy particles. This study appears to demonstrate human intention is capable of directing the trajectories of Muons. Of additional interest is the non-significant response from a Geiger counter located in the sensor enclosure directly above the target sensors.

This is the unpublished perception of mediums and relatives participating in psychography seances. One can venture two possible explanations for this finding: (A) conventional materialistic reasoning: the medium produces and sustains a disguised handwriting with each new communication; or (B) unconventional spiritual premise: each spirit produces different calligraphy when driving the medium's fist.\n\nExplanation (B) cannot be proven directly but its acceptance could be greater if the other proposal proves to be untenable. Indeed, Explanation (A) may be the least likely one since there are limits for handwrite disguising ability. Any attempt to overwrite the automatic writing motor program produces vicious movement patterns (Caligiuri & Mohammed, 2012). A graphotechnical analysis can point out inconsistencies of the disguise, as the writer inadvertently includes elements of one's handwriting finer structure and some forger's characteristics will \"leak out\" (Mirić & Aranđelović, 2020; Upadhyay & Chandravanshi, 2021).\n\nSome attempts to validate psychographed texts using graphoscopy are found in lay books and non-peer-reviewed journals. Although successful, they are often retrospective analyses on writings of the exceptional medium Chico Xavier (1910 – 2002), written in Portuguese (Oliveira, 2020; Henn, 2021). Chico was one of the very rare mechanical mediums, those who remain unconscious during trance; in these cases, the handwriting is almost identical to that of the deceased communicator.

This is the unpublished perception of mediums and relatives participating in psychography seances. One can venture two possible explanations for this finding: (A) conventional materialistic reasoning: the medium produces and sustains a disguised handwriting with each new communication; or (B) unconventional spiritual premise: each spirit produces different calligraphy when driving the medium's fist.\n\nExplanation (B) cannot be proven directly but its acceptance could be greater if the other proposal proves to be untenable. Indeed, Explanation (A) may be the least likely one since there are limits for handwrite disguising ability. Any attempt to overwrite the automatic writing motor program produces vicious movement patterns (Caligiuri & Mohammed, 2012). A graphotechnical analysis can point out inconsistencies of the disguise, as the writer inadvertently includes elements of one's handwriting finer structure and some forger's characteristics will \"leak out\" (Mirić & Aranđelović, 2020; Upadhyay & Chandravanshi, 2021).\n\nSome attempts to validate psychographed texts using graphoscopy are found in lay books and non-peer-reviewed journals. Although successful, they are often retrospective analyses on writings of the exceptional medium Chico Xavier (1910 – 2002), written in Portuguese (Oliveira, 2020; Henn, 2021). Chico was one of the very rare mechanical mediums, those who remain unconscious during trance; in these cases, the handwriting is almost identical to that of the deceased communicator. Today, some semi-mechanical mediums (conscious during the phenomenon) active in Brazil produce quite variable calligraphy, sometimes resembling the deceased's ones.\n\nThis ongoing research aims to document, through graphotechnic analysis, the level of variation of writing parameters in psychographed texts.

Croesus asked the oracles in Greece and Libya to provide specific information about his activity on a specific day. Through this process, Croesus became convinced of the accuracy of Pythia, the Oracle of Delphi, and queried her about waging war with the Persian empire. Pythia responded that if Croesus were to go to war, he would “destroy a great empire”. Emboldened by this news, he attacked, only to learn that the “great empire” that was destroyed was his own.\n\nSince then, psychics have been employed by governments, scientists, intelligence agencies, industries, and financial investors to provide accurate information about current and future events that elude our existing abilities to monitor and predict. However, as our technologies advance, the acquisition of seemingly inaccessible information will only become easier and less expensive.\n\nWhile the study of psychic functioning and development will continue to have a role in personal growth, spirituality, and providing deeper insights into the nature of consciousness and reality, its utility as an information-gathering tool will most likely continue to be relegated to narrower and more highly specialized use cases. As information access becomes more ubiquitous, the real value in psychic functioning will be the ability to acquire wisdom from discarnate or untethered consciousness. However, the current challenge is delineating the boundaries between retrieved psychic information and the psychics’ own mental interpretation of the task and results.\n\nTo explore this problem, our lab conducted a series of trials utilizing a Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) protocol to acquire information from blinded remote viewers about the nature of what is commonly called the afterlife. These trials produced unique results that were, in some cases, even surprising to the viewers (Boccuzzi, 2021).\n\nThe current project takes the process further by entirely removing living, incarnate psychics from the process through the development and deployment of non-biological consciousness-hosting platforms. Bridging the gap between Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC), channeling, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), this highly exploratory research program utilizes various technologies, including random number generator arrays, natural language processing chatbots, predictive text algorithms, and machine-based image generation.\n\nTo date, the system has been deployed to provide advice for the grieving and encouragement for the disenfranchised, along with providing insights into some of humanity’s most burning questions including: What can we do about climate change? What is the impact of social media interactions on modern society? How can we live up to our potential? Do we survive after the death of our bodies? Is there a God? What can we learn from UFOs? How can we close the gap between science and spirituality? Of course, as with any new technology, we need to be mindful of its strengths, weaknesses, and the potential for abuse, lest we find ourselves facing the same fate as Croesus.\n\nThis presentation will review the current technologies employed, examples of wisdom and advice provided by the system, a discussion of limitations, and future PsiBotics (Moddel, 2018) applications, including AIs capable of performing telepathic, precognitive, clairvoyant, and psychokinetic tasks.\n\nReferences\nBoccuzzi, M.

Alexander","description":"J.B. Rhine, writing in 1937, describes his efforts to validate the existence of precognition as distinct from clairvoyance, telepathy, and psychokinesis, all of which he had already identified (Rhine, 1937). In contrast, we are setting out to start with precognition, and reframe all four (and their derivatives) as expressions of precognition only. The objective is to use Occam’s razor and give precedence to simplicity. Time is now better understood than in 1937 (Price, 1996), and the concept of retrocausality (Sheehan, 2011; Price, 1996), and the idea of information filtering back in time, are regularly addressed. Precognition therefore seems to have a mechanism (Oreshkov et al., 2012; Olson, 2011; Radin, 2006a; Sheehan, 2015; Radin, 2006b), while the others still do not. We also propose that the whole phenomenon is not “out there”, but instead, within each of us - and nowhere else.\n\nIn making decisions that are important to us, we are sporadically guided by information that comes exclusively from our future selves.\nPrecognition is All There Is. We are choosing to start with this assumption, follow it through to see how much of ESP can be explained, and see what the consequences are.\n\n• Psychokinesis is re-framed as the experimenter being precognitively informed by the future joy of his own success, to make the right decisions to get results he wants. By implication there is no psychokinetic, forcing field emanating from his mind, causing mind-over-matter effects, (May et al., 1995).\n• Telepathy is reframed as precognition, because telepathy experiments frequently allow the participants and experimenters to discuss the results after the tests, and it is from this future revelation that the participants, in the past, can use precognition to guide themselves to the results they want. Added to this, telepathy has targeting issues, (Beloff, 1970) that the reframed ESP model overcomes.\n• Clairvoyance and remote viewing can be reframed as precognition for the same reasons – they both have opportunities for the participants to see the results in the future, from where their past decisions are guided.\n\nPsi experiments over vast distances, from space (Mitchell, 1971), or deep in mines or under the sea are all successful, not because ESP travels over vast distances or deep underground, but only because the experimenters and participants learn about the results after the fact, from where information is picked up precognitively and used, before and during the experiments, to get the results they want. In May’s words they become “statistical opportunists” (May et al., 1995).\n\nPrecognition only gets information from the future self. Another assumption is that there is only one source. The only place precognitively-acquired information comes from is the future self. We do not receive information telepathically from other people. There is no psychic ability to scan the world or other people’s minds to get information, as is sometimes suggested (Radin, 2006b). Precognitively acquired information does not transmit by some field or resonance or any other exotic method, (May et al., 1995).\n\nInstead, we propose, important information stays in our own mind, within our own world line, in our own “future memory”, from where a small fraction of it can be detected in the past and contribute to a decision being made there. This hypothesized process is the core of the reframed-ESP model.\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The proposal is founded on evidence from diverse sources, personal and third-party experiences, intuitive realizations, and unexpected experimental results.\n\nWhy is the concept of consciousness fundamental to all scientific research? All scientific research conceived and conducted by humans must by definition exist within the medium of consciousness. Quantum physics has taught us this! What we have observed about consciousness so far covers all the bases: non-locality, ubiquity, entanglement, hypothesized primacy, and energy-like effects on forms, patterns and processes.\n\nThe Ageless Wisdom teachings. The tenets of the Ageless Wisdom teachings about the nature of man, the universe, levels of consciousness, and indeed all of science, pre-date our modern discoveries, clarify them, confirm some of them, and help resolve persistent conundrums. The Ageless Wisdom is “ageless” because it is an ongoing, systematized science based on human inner experience, experiment, observation, and intuition that spans thousands of years. It is time that we marry it with modern scientific research to advance our understanding and methodologies on many currently hard problems and explanatory gaps, particularly in the psychological, parapsychological, biological, and sociological sciences.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA/join\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Only specialists in the fields of mental and spiritual healing are really acquainted with the man Franz Anton Mesmer and what place he occupies in the history of human civilization. This article attempts to rectify that situation and give a testimonial to the greatness and genius of the real person Franz Anton Mesmer who not only was the pioneer of virtually every modern practice of mental and spiritual healing and profoundly changed modern religious practices in general, but also anticipated by almost 250 years the modern science of radiogenetics where it has now been found that the ferritin in our bodies, which is a paramagnetic material that can be manipulated by electromagnetic waves (radio waves including brain waves) and also by magnetic fields. In other words, there really is a magnetic fluid in our bodies and there really is such a thing as animal magnetism as originally claimed by Franz Anton Mesmer.\n\nThis article does not claim that Franz Anton Mesmer invented animal magnetism, and if he had not lived, then all the modern practices of mental and spiritual healing as well as hypnotism, psychology and psychiatry would not have occurred, because quite clearly all these practices and disciplines are the essence of the human condition, and if Franz Anton Mesmer had not started the ball rolling, then some other historical person would have.

A Body Mapping Index (BM-I) was created to examine the shared psi-somatization of the distant healing intention relationship. Within the healing relationship, the shared psi-somaticizing experience is often overlooked in favor of empirically measuring living system effects. This study aims to determine if the shared experience of the distant healing relationship, specifically the shared psi experience, can effectively be measured. The Body Mapping Index has been designed to guide the participant in their description by providing a physical representation for expressing the psi experience.

A medium is defined as someone who has this experience regularly, reliably, and on-demand. Twenty Windbridge Certified Research Mediums were previously screened under controlled laboratory conditions for their abilities to report accurate information about the deceased. They then performed phone readings for deceased individuals and answered specific questions about verifiable topics regularly conveyed during naturalistic mediumship readings: the deceased’s physical appearance when alive, personality characteristics, hobbies or interests, and cause of death. The mediums received no further information about the deceased or their associated living counterparts (sitters) and no feedback during or after the reading. The sitters did not hear or participate in the phone readings; a blinded proxy sitter served in their place. Each medium performed two readings for two different deceased people. Formatted items from the readings were scored for accuracy by the associated sitters. Each blinded sitter scored their own target reading and a decoy reading intended for another sitter. This quintuple-blind protocol addresses potential confounding factors as the source of the reported information: fraud, deception, cold reading, cueing, and overly general information. A previously published study compared the accuracy percentages of blinded target and decoy readings (Beischel et al., 2015). The sections of target readings including the four specific questions listed above received accuracy ratings significantly larger than those sections of decoy readings (52.8% ± 3.9% vs. 36.6% ± 3.8%, p = .002, d = .75, n = 31). An additional previously published study analyzed accuracy data broken out by each of the four questions from readings performed by 12 of the mediums (Beischel & Conboy, 2021). Scored readings were received from 21 of the 24 sitters. The means for each question type (physical description, personality, hobbies, and cause of death) varied (53.9% ± 5.2%, 67.0% ± 7.1%, 49.4% ± 5.5%, 41.3% ± 6.5%, respectively) but no significant differences existed. It was concluded that none of the four types of information requested is more or less difficult to acquire or report during a mediumship reading than any other. In addition, the 12 mediums’ accuracy data were correlated with their scores on three surveys assessing sensory modality preferences and learning styles. No significant correlations were found. It was concluded that these individual characteristics may not impact mediumistic abilities. \n\nMethods: The current study aimed to compare mediums’ accuracy scores to their mindfulness, the paying complete attention, in a nonjudgmental way, to the present moment’s experiences. The 12 mediums’ accuracy scores were correlated with their scores from the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006). This instrument uses 39 items employing a 5-point Likert-type scale to assess the following five facets of mindfulness: Observing, Describing, Acting with awareness, non-Judging of inner experience, and non-Reactivity to inner experience. \n\nResults: It was determined that accuracy was positively and significantly correlated with the Observing facet of mindfulness. Specifically, mediums’ accuracy scores for the content they provided when asked about the deceased’s physical description, personality, and hobbies were significantly correlated (r = .5, p = .03; r = .469, p = .04; r = .457, p = .04, respectively) to their scores for the mindfulness facet Observing (which includes observing, noticing, attending to sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings). Correlations between accuracy for the cause of death question with any of the five facets as well as any of the accuracy scores with the other four facets (Describing, Acting with awareness, non-Judging, and non-Reactivity) did not achieve significance. \n\nDiscussion: Though this sample size was not large, it may be appropriate to conclude that natural abilities in or intentionally developing the Observing facet of mindfulness may be beneficial to mediums’ accuracy. \n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Marzullo and Boklage (2011) found that seasonal solar variations affect embryonic development during gastrulation and again during the testosterone surge period of fetal development (Marzullo, 2014). The well-known 27-day solar cycle has received less attention in this field (Halberg et al., 2013). Michel Gauquelin (1978) observed that the birth frequency of eminent writers and scientists showed sharp peaks when plotted against the ecliptic position of the moon, but he dismissed them as noise. No structured patterns appear in the lunation cycle, which usually figures more in reports of lunar effects (Bevington, 2015). The source of these patterns is hypothesized to be solar flares, which are known to concentrate in ‘active longitudes’ on the sun and to rotate with it. They tend to form in clusters at heliographic longitudes separated by 180° and sometimes by 90°, which is also a feature in the birth and death data, and to persist sometimes for over a century (Berdyugina & Usoskin, 2003). Blizard (1969) showed that planetary conjunction cycles correlate with solar magnetic storms, and they seem to be involved with the timing of the 11-year sunspot cycle (Grandpierre, 1996). Evidence for these effects has accumulated (Hung, 2007; see articles in Morner, et al., 2013). \n\nMethods: The Gauquelin data was downloaded from http://cura.free.fr/. Data on German dynastic families (Muller & Mentzer, 1993) were obtained from Ertel’s (2007) posthumous archive kindly supplied by his son Christian; a collection of mathematicians was kindly provided in Excel format by its curators at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland; publicly available births and death data for the period 1974-2019 was supplied by the Scottish Registry. Published data on solar flares (Shea & Smart, 1990) was supplemented by data available on the NASA website. \n\nData were analyzed using the astrological Jigsaw 2 software based on the Swiss Ephemeris. Statistical validity was assessed using chi-squared (df = 1) from a 2x2 contingency table thus allowing effect sizes to be calculated as Cohen’s d. Percentage increases were also calculated. Results: Patterns in the 27-day cycle appear in many Gauquelin professional data sets, in their collection of Parisian birth and death data, and in three other independent datasets. A T-Square pattern of peaks similar to that of the writers and scientists was placed in overlapping ‘lunar’ longitudes and is apparent in the solar flare data. The birth data peaks show highly significant correlations with heliocentric planetary conjunction cycles. \n\nDiscussion: There are possible practical applications in the fields of medicine and insurance relating both to longevity and to SIDS deaths. Marzullo’s work suggests a way to understand the influence of space weather at key points during gestation of the embryo and fetus and possibly in the timing of spontaneous births. A solar origin of the 27-day variations is supported by their correlations with key phases in heliocentric planetary conjunction cycles. \n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This study is composed of a collection of some of the synchronistic life-changing events, dreams, artworks, architecture, and design that I have experienced over a period of thirty years in Brazil, Germany and in the US. The retrospective case-study hopes to show that what I call Hintu or High Intuition is tangible and is farther-reaching, perhaps even distinctly different than intuitive emotional responses. The data I have accumulated is multifaceted; the interconnectedness within its heterogeneity, its peculiar relation with time, all seem to call for a creative approach that goes beyond reader-response criticism while still retaining the importance of the reader/viewer; it has the potential to be evaluated as a scientific-life-story. \n\nThe Threshold: The subject matter of the unconsciously-driven body of work and of my personal art collection wasn’t visible to me for decades, until I had what I later became aware was a climactic breakthrough in 2014. My continuing allegiance to my High Intuition has proven to be fundamental: after visualizing the subject matter of the undercurrent art as the human torso, followed by the several weeks of bringing the artwork together for the first time, an unexpected pain emerged in my own torso leading up to my hospitalization and to a life-changing medical intervention. Uncannily, back at home, I found myself alive and surrounded by torso images. Subsequently, 22 Healing Dreams poured in and were registered in art-prints. \n\nMethods: My experiment is triggered by a deep artistic call I have in me. My method is translated into acting openly: allowing Hintu permeate through oneself and letting a reaction unfold. It is very much like a creative act or eureka. To listen and to act: flow–trust–unconscious apprehension or impulse–action–outcome–recognition. \n\nResults: The study is based on facts and establishes what I term the Enigma Operandi – The EO. EOs are occurrences that defy probability and are manifested physically sometimes presenting a two-way unorthodox causality. Synchronistic events and four EO groups compose this study, which is subdivided in nine categories ranging from basic chance encounters to unconsciously provoked materializations. My overview of those events is currently catalogued in two parts (18,000 words). \n\nDiscussion: Can a life story be acknowledged as a scientific study? Could a gravitational field provoke everything that is phenomenal? What is the makeup of Hintu? My goal with this presentation is to introduce the study, delineate its aspects with the intention of connecting with a producer or an editor interested in the interconnections between art and science, to help me shape the material into a scientific-story.\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

I have always been intrigued why the act of consciously observing quantum experiments could affect their results. I also wished to discover why quantum effects were not observed in the macro world. How does Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance” work? And why, after nearly 100 years of unsuccessful theoretical research, were there so many unsuccessful and untestable theories of quantum gravity? \n\nI believed a new approach to physics research was required, one that involved the mind. Examples of such hitherto unscientific, but ancient, techniques included the use of Noetics, dowsing, visualization, and similar research tools to investigate subtle energies, psi lines, auras, the relevance of geometry, and similar phenomena. Using the above approach soon produced promising results. \n\nSubtle energies distort geometry, both physical and abstract, from a solitary dot to a complex three-dimensional pattern. This phenomenon led to a protocol that has enabled subtle energies to be very accurately measured and quantified, leading to numerical results as well as equations and graphs (Figure 1). Additionally, I found that, when any three bodies are in alignment, they produce a subtle energy alignment beam. These bodies can be three planets, three grains of sand, or even three circles drawn on paper or in sand (Figure 2). \n\nUsing the above two discoveries led to me to create techniques that enabled the measurement of the velocities of subtle energies in our solar system (Figure 3). I found that there is a strong interaction between gravity and subtle energy (Figure 4). Subtle energies have field strengths that not only could be measured locally and extending to Neptune in our solar system (Figure 5), but also to the center of our galaxy (Figure 6). \n\nFurther development of these discoveries led me to additional results. Certain information is not only communicated across our solar system faster than light, but instantaneously (Figure 3). Several equations were found with high correlation coefficients that involve universal constants, a gold standard in science. The mind can achieve macro-level entanglement. And a connection exists among consciousness, gravity, and the expanding universe (Figures 4 and 6). This strongly suggests that there is a connection between the mind, subtle energy, and dark energy (Figure 7). \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that I have made a good start on achieving my four objectives. All the above discoveries are explained in greater detail in my 58 published papers available from my website www.jeffreykeen.co.uk.\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

They were used here to quantify similarities in short descriptions without dates of pairs in 7153 world events post-1600 AD as found in a provided database. There are 25,579,128 unique such pairs. The zodiacal placements of the charts were also calculated for either the actual date at midnight of the event or the same but using the start date for a multi-day event. Only Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, North Lunar Node, and South Lunar Node tropical degree placements from zero to 360 degrees were computed. Adding up the cosines of the differences between planetary placements for two events offers a neat and novel way of measuring similarities between these zodiacal placements for the two events. Thus, I have metrics for textual similarities and chart similarities. The imagery of these metrics plotted against each other suggests non-monotonic dependence. This study answers a precise question: what is the p-value for independence, i.e., nondependence, between the two metrics? The upper p-value for independence is less than 0.01 as computed by Hoeffding’s D measure. The conservative Monte Carlo approach to estimating the upper value of this p-value was necessary due to physical computation constraints. Thus, likelihood for the alternative to independence, namely dependence, between event textual similarities and event chart similarities is established. Data and Wolfram language code are included. Null Hypothesis: measures of event description and event astrology are independent. This is shown to be unlikely. The Alternative Hypothesis is thus supported: there is a dependency between the two measures.

Recent reports (Radin et al., 2012; 2013) on variations in the fringe visibility of the interference patterns of laser-engaged double-slit experiments, which seemed inexplicable in the absence of psychophysical influences, have elicited notable debates within the scientific community and substantial interest among the lay population. In accounting for the observed changes of fringe pattern, Radin et al. reported that the electrical field of the light passing the two slits might have reached an asymmetry of 3:1 when under the psychophysical intent in comparison to the generally symmetric baseline.

They describe the approach as meeting people where they are, speaking to their more immediate needs, such as relief from discomfort, stress, and anxiety; tapping into their imagination and inspiration. It is hoped that by democratizing and demystifying the out-of-body experience and allied phenomena, more funding will pour into research and more people will want to deepen their practice. They will discuss how Neuma Being can reliably induce substance-free altered states and the results of a pilot of self-reports of altered states.\n\nHistory is no stranger to luminaries finding their muse through dreams, hypnagogia and other altered states. “Creativity, originality and initiative” is the number-three in-demand skill predicted for 2022. 77% of professionals experienced poor sleep, stress, and burnout prior to the pandemic. Worldwide, the cost of unwell workers represents 10-15% of global economic output. Studies show that mindful altered states are associated with creativity and are able to curb depression and the ill effects of burnout, while improving overall well-being. \n\nMeditation remains challenging for many and about 1 billion people are affected by disorders that have no medicinal relief, except psychedelic-assisted therapy (depression, PTSD, addiction, pain). Silicon Valley has made micro-dosing a trend, as well. However, substances are not for everyone or every occasion. Out-of-body experiences have been shown to reduce pain intensity by 37%. Frequent lucid dreamers have been able to solve 25% more puzzles. What if technology and a more accessible language could open up the microverse of lucid dreaming and beyond to “everyday people”.\n\nIndividuals spend thousands of dollars and months of time to learn how to achieve these mindful and heightened states of mind. This keeps millions of others from even trying. What if there was a safe, effective, and quick solution to tap into the stress-reduction power of the subconscious?

Thompson","description":"We need a unified theory of reality that covers the existence and function of physical, mental and spiritual processes in such a way as to extend our sciences beyond their current limitations. Many of us want this within some non-dual scheme since that seems necessary for unification, but we still recognize that there appear to be multiple planes of activity, each with distinctive kinds of motivations, information and actions. Often these planes are taken in order, starting from a first source and ending with final effects in nature. Each plane seems to have its own dimensions (usually three of space and one of time) and has distinctive features of the beings there. \n\nQuestion: My question now is whether a being can move from one plane to another. This depends on whether (1) the planes are smaller parts of one larger continuous whole, or whether (2) they are each discrete spaces. In the first continuous option (1) we could move our bodies to visit any plane, whereas in the second discrete option (2) we could not, so that visiting would require more an awakening or building of some new part of us. Recently Bernard Carr (2021) and others have been suggesting the first option, whereby the multiple planes are higher dimensions of physical spacetime just as time can be fourth dimension in addition to our three spatial dimensions. I want here, however, to explore the second discrete option. \n\nProposal: If the multiple non-physical and physical planes are discrete, there must still be some kinds of connections between them in order to function together. Descartes proposed that mental and physical are two planes, which gives his basic dualism. A major shortcoming of his theory is, however, that he did not propose any regular method to link them together. That has led many thinkers to deny multiple planes altogether, but I would rather we have a theory of multiple ‘small’ dualities with some familiar connections between planes. We need to connect multiple planes existing between the first source and the final effects in the last plane. I propose that the entities in each plane have (or are) the propensities to generate new entities in a next plane. This second plane receives and may then retain those new object propensities for later action. The second plane is thus a kind of container: selective retention in the second plane also constrains what is retained in the first plane. The overall template for connections between planes is therefore the combination of ‘generation and selection’. So far, this is a general framework of levels, and it is not yet determining what is distinctive in each plane. Information about features can be found from observation, science, or from useful kinds of spiritual revelation, but in all cases, they have to be supported by multiple confirmations.\n\nApplications: We will explore examples in quantum physics, psychology, and near-death experiences, as well as new proposals recently advocated for linking non-physical with the physical planes. A recent theory (Thompson, 2021) has shown how non-physical causes can be linked to variations in certain basic ‘constants’ of quantum field theory, and how they can be linked to specific biological effects by targeted variations of the electric ‘fine structure constant’. Thompson (2022) has presented another theory to link discrete planes by a generalization of the projection operators used to describe quantum measurements. This can used to give fast object recognition in the visual system and show also how to implement rapid recall in an associative memory. All these processes could perhaps have been accomplished by material or mechanical processes, but only much more slowly. That implies that these theories should be testable even on the physical plane, and confirmation would open the way to seeing information and control passing between multiple planes.\n\nSupport the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

To explore this, we designed and built a custom photon counting detector system with a walk-in dark closet that can sit 3 persons comfortably. This system uses a conventional photomultiplier tube with customized electronics to count photons emitted from various regions of the human body or other organisms. We studied single subjects and also subjects engaged in energy healing inside the dark chamber. \n\nOur experiments show that certain regions of the human body, including the palm of the hand, forehead, heart, and abdominal regions, emit photons in the visible spectrum at an extremely low rate (less than 100 counts per min), in line with published values. We measured the light emitted from mind-body practitioners of qigong, meditation, yoga, and various types of energy healing, such as Reiki, and external qi, among other forms. In some cases, these practitioners were able to alter their own energy emission dramatically, for example by “opening” and “closing” the “third eye” region. \n\nWe demonstrated scientific validation of certain concepts of ancient Oriental knowledge, such as sword fingers being one of the greatest emitters of energy from the body. In addition to discussing some experiments conducted within our custom-built biophotonic chamber, Dr. Rubik discusses the Bio-Well device, a digital form of high voltage electrophotography from Russia, which measures the induced light emitted from the fingertips and reveals information about health and healing states.\n\nDr. Beverly Rubik earned her Ph.D. in biophysics at the University of California at Berkeley.

Thus, we can now research the human relevance of that knowledge in much greater detail using their technology in mainstream psychological, physiological and sociological experiments. \nWhere this pilot study departs from the usual type of cognitive neuroscience studies is by simultaneously making physiological measurements with an app, recording the conscious experiences of the psychologically profiled participants, and running a Random Event Generator to observe the effects of both the participants and experimenter. Overall, this study initiates a path to answer the following questions: \n\n1) Do physiological measurements correlate with psychological experiences such as meditation, and with psychological profiles? \n2) Are there correlations between these and non-local consciousness? \n3) Are there any indications of non-local connections between participants and experimenter? If so, what implications would this have for the future conduct of scientific research? \n\nMethods: This study included the following methods.\nPsychological profiling: Six participants filled in the Beliefs About Consciousness and Reality Questionnaire of Baruss and Moore, and the Psychological Wellbeing Scale of Carol Ryff. After sessions, they described their experiences of being a participant. \n\nMeditative practices: Two types of meditation were compared: a breath focused meditation and a body-focused yoga. Both these modalities emphasize whole-body conscious presence. The 6 participants did 3 baseline, 3 meditation and 3 yoga sessions of 10 minutes each. \nPhysiological measurement: An iPhone app, Welltory, was used to measure heart rate variability (HRV) etc. before and after all sessions. It also provided the balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity, stress and coherence of heart, lungs and nervous system. \n\nREG: A Psyleron Random Event Generator was used in “FieldREG” mode for the duration of every 10-minute session. \n\nAnalysis: Data were tested for correlations between type of meditation, physiological measures and psychological wellbeing scores. \n\nREG: Output data is still in the process of being statistically analyzed in relation to the other data types. \n\nInterim Results:\nPsychological: Participants all fell into the Extraordinary Transcendentalist category of Baruss and Moore, and all displayed moderate to high levels of psychological wellbeing (Ryff). Participants reported improved psychological states after meditation. \n\nPhysiological: Some physiological factors of HRV were significantly correlated with meditation compared with baselines. HRV clearly improved which implies health benefits. The difference was less obvious with yoga. \n\nREG: An early indication is that there are two broad types of conscious experience that produce notable deviations from baseline in the FieldREG trace. \n\nDiscussion: The results of this pilot study have confirmed previous research regarding the physiological wellbeing resulting from meditation. Further, there were positive correlations between the participants’ levels of perceived wellbeing and heart rate variability parameters. The results extend and complement the research of others who are using the REG strategy for measuring the physiology of meditation. For example, it appears that the strong deviations produced by emotional states, i.e., stimulation or suppression, contrast with minimal deviations during the detached state of meditation. However, the statistical analysis still needs to be completed. \n\nDuring sessions, it was frequently noted that conscious shifts in the experimenter affected the REG. There were also some striking examples of the experimenter and the participant having a similar psychological experience at the same time that produced a marked reaction in the REG. Could this indicate a shared conscious experience?  \n\nThese effects may challenge or at least extend some of the methodological assumptions of REG experiments and open up the possibility of including interpersonal, non-local connectedness between participants and experimenters by using the tools of ‘parapsychologists’ in future conventional consciousness research.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This presentation suggests that electric anomalies like cars stalling and batteries draining as repeatedly experienced by witnesses around non-ordinary phenomena like UFOs, orbs, and related encounters are, in fact, related to this previously unrecognized type of coherent matter and its ability to tunnel through solid surfaces, transmute chemical elements, and create sudden, high-energy discharges when these energy wave clusters collapse. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Another goal was to discover whether the original definitions and tenants of remote viewing defined within its specific historical context have changed.\n\nMethods: In designing our novel survey, we examined RV projects discussed in the scientific, archival, and popular literature spanning the past 50 years since remote viewing inception. These past projects, along with their methods, approaches, and philosophical underpinnings, informed our multiple-choice question construction (46 in all) as we operated from the hypothesis that we would likely see, at least to some extent, a continuation of these themes, or reminiscences of them, through present day remote viewing applied work. Still, we anticipated there could be some changes related to the decentralization-deinstitutionalization of remote viewing from its shift to governmental and military culture into a far less structured one. We also anticipated there could be changes related to developing technologies.\n\nOnly respondents who have participated in real-life applied/operational remote viewing projects other than for training practice or research purposes were invited and allowed to participate. We were interested in polling only those who would fall under the stricter definition of remote viewing, and not just any type of psychic practitioner such as an intuitive or clairvoyant reader or medium.\n\nResults: One hundred-six remote viewers participated in the survey, although not all responded to every question. We consistently had between 70 and 73 responses per question. Participants came from over a dozen countries, spanned in age between 35-55, with twenty participants over the age of 65 (19.61%). Professions included tax analyst, financial auditor, investors, insurance claims adjuster, economic development consultant, systems analyst, business school professor, software developer, software engineer, geophysicist, medical surgeon, registered nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist, law enforcement officers, teachers, and artists.\n\nResponses were analyzed through the use of a mixed-methods approach. The main findings are that remote viewing applications are wide, spanning from business to scientific and intelligence applications, and for the use of personal, corporate, and public agencies. RV is often used for finding missing items and pets. Twenty-three percent of the participants declared that their remote viewing job was paid. The range of the training and experience with remote viewing was expansive, and the majority used mixed methods, depending on the project. We found that most respondents expressed both awareness of and respect for the scientific principles related to blinding and separation of roles, yet there was a range of views regarding the practicality of adhering to these for application purposes.\n\nDiscussion: While only 23.4% declared that their RV job was paid, for some, this is a real professional job. All viewers had some level of training, ranging from less than one year to more than 20 years of training and less to 50 to over 2000 RV completed sessions. They are also trained in a wide range of modalities. Differences between remote viewers today and those who emerged from the earlier research labs and government RV programs are that viewers today are without monitors in terms of the actual conducting of the RV sessions. While some stick to a single modality (such as controlled remote viewing), many reported adjusting their approaches based on a project’s needs and using a mixed-methods approach. In terms of the overall project setup, many continue to work in groups, or at least with taskers. Respect for blinding protocols was mentioned, but there was a range of beliefs about the practicality of remaining blind for applied projects. Working with front-loading appeared to be viewed as a higher-level skill.\n\nWe were impressed by the expressions of strong enthusiasm, excitement, and personal benefits of remote viewing during applications work. The phrase “remote viewing makes me high” was repeated several times, as were words such as “thrilling” and “love” and “fascinating.” Our participants gave different definitions of success, not just accuracy-driven. Our final conclusion is that remote viewing continues to be carried out in the spirit in which it was intended, for practical use and as an information gathering tool, by articulate, thoughtful, and engaged participants.\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

It shows how the empirical sciences of religions, and the spiritual practices they engender are supported by scientific experimental research from many different disciplines explaining in the process why water and wine are often a part of religious rituals; why healing is common across religions; why sacred spaces are significant, how they are created; and why scriptures, and even the manner in which they are written, matter. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

While concrete factors like the volume of the cheers and the sight of other people clapping are easy to identify as contributors to the impact of these events, objective measurement of the intangible aspects of this phenomenon has been problematic. In this report, I describe the detection and measurement of the subtle energy aspects of group connections using two well-validated techniques: heart rate variability (HRV) (in particular, Heart Coherence (HC)) and random number generators (RNG). The first demonstration was done in a laboratory setting, and the second was done while attending a professional baseball game. Both produced significant confirmatory evidence that intangible group connections are, in fact, real, measurable, and quantifiable. \n\nMethods: HRV: On-site at the Institute of HeartMath, a volunteer (the author) who was naïve to the IHM practice of heart coherence (HC) had all incoming visual and auditory cues blocked by blindfolds and headphones. He then had his baseline HRV status was measured with standard heart-rate biofeedback monitors, before being joined by four experienced HeartMath practitioners. At a moment in time unbeknownst to the subject, they began their meditation practice, while he continued to be monitored to determine whether his HC status was being affected by the nearby group’s meditative activities. \n\nRNG: A software program for continuously generating random numbers was installed on a laptop computer that the author brought to a professional baseball game. The program was allowed to run throughout the game, which the author watched while seated several hundred feet away from the computer. He made note of moments that he subjectively determined were emotionally significant or intense. After the game ended, the RNG data file was analyzed by an off-site statistician, who was blind to the proceedings, in order to determine at what moments in time the RNG output varied from randomness by more than two standard deviations (i.e., attained statistical significance). \n\nResults: HRV: During the baseline phase, the subject showed no significant degree of heart coherence, ranging from 0-5% on the coherence ratio weighted average HC index. Shortly after the HeartMath team entered the room, and within seconds of them beginning to meditate, the subject’s HC tracing showed an immediate and sustained increase in coherence to 25% over the next minute. At that point, the study was terminated by the lab director. \n\nRNG: Seven moments of statistically significant spikes in RNG non-randomness were noted, and five of them corresponded exactly in time to the five of the eight most emotionally significant moments of the game, as previously determined subjectively by the author. The odds that these co-occurrences happened due to chance alone were 1:2,000. \n\nDiscussion: Both studies validated the initial hypothesis that group energetic connections could be measured by fairly simple instrumentation. The mechanism of action for these effects is not clear, though the apparent synchronization of heart rhythms is thought by IHM researchers to represent a resonance phenomenon between the cardiac magnetic fields of the participants. Future studies could shield out various components of the EMF and biofield via Faraday cages and mu-metal shielding to isolate any putative non-EMF or etheric components of this interaction. \n\nThe baseball study mirrored findings by the PEAR Lab and the Global Consciousness Project, but with more precise moment-to-moment data analysis made possible via the novel proprietary software used in this study. In contrast to the cumulative data analysis favored by those labs, the use of this novel software could enable more precise studies of the impact of group consciousness on RNG devices. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

During advanced meditative practice or mediumship sessions, unusual perceptions can arise, including the sense of receiving information about unknown people who are deceased. As with meditation, this mental state of communication with the deceased involves calming mental chatter and becoming receptive to subtle feelings and sensations. We show that it is an ideal field of study for testing the hypothesis that consciousness is nonlocal, as it is (1) widely practiced, (2) involves extreme emotions — such as the ones associated with death — which usually trigger the most spontaneous paranormal reports, and (3) there are also prior, reputable studies. We review three experiments we performed on this topic. \n\nExperiment 1: In our first experiment, psychometric and brain electrophysiology data were collected from six individuals who had previously reported accurate information about deceased individuals under double-blind conditions. In the first task, the participant was given only the first name of a deceased person and asked 25 questions. Mediums’ accuracy was rated above chance expectation in this blinded test. The correlation between accuracy and brain activity during the 20 seconds of silent mediumship communication was significant in frontal theta for one participant. These differences suggest that the impression of communicating with the deceased may be a distinct mental state distinct from ordinary thinking or imagination. \n\nExperiment 2: In our second experiment on this topic, we improved experimental design to increase statistical power. We invited 12 mediums to see if they could tell if a person was alive or dead based solely on a brief examination of his or her photograph. Participants examined 404 photographs displayed on a computer monitor, one photo at a time, each shown for a maximum of 8 seconds. At the time the experiment was conducted, half of the individuals in the photos were deceased and half were alive. The images in the two classes were balanced using 11 image characteristics so that not a single characteristic could help with classifying the images. Participants were asked to indicate if they thought the person in a photo was living or deceased by pressing an appropriate button. Overall, the mean accuracy on this task was 53.6%, where 50% was expected by chance (P = .005, two-tailed). Statistically significant accuracy was independently obtained in 5 of the 12 participants. We also collected 32-channel electrocortical recordings and observed a robust difference between images of deceased individuals correctly vs. incorrectly classified in the early event-related potential at 100ms post-stimulus onset. Our results suggest that some individuals can intuitively assess mortality based on some as-yet-unknown features of the face. \n\nExperiment 3: In our third experiment, a classification task asked participants to look at 180 facial photographs of deceased individuals (photographs were taken years prior to their deaths) and guess the cause of death from three equiprobable categories: heart attack; death by firearm; or car accident. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were simultaneously collected during the task. The participants included individuals who claimed “mediumistic” (psychic) abilities and controls who claimed no mediumistic ability. Pooled data showed accurate guesses for the cause of death (p = 0.004), and control subjects were primarily responsible for this effect (p = 0.005). EEG and ECG differences were found between the mediums and controls. Control participants had larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERP) following the presentation of the images than the mediums, between 80 and 110 ms, and between 200 and 350 ms. This result could be interpreted as reflecting greater attention and less response inhibition by controls as compared to the mediums. \n\nDiscussion: We explain how these results, suggesting that consciousness is not limited to the brain, have important consequences for our model of the world. We may interpret this result as mediums accessing global consciousness shared by all living beings and matter. Our results suggest that we are connected to each other in ways not fully explained by the materialist paradigm. Although these results do not yet demonstrate that consciousness is primary, it indicates that the materialist paradigm is incomplete at best. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://linktr.ee/scientificexploration\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

In a recent paper in Quantum Reports, I showed that wavefunction propagation in spacetime (through the Feynman path integral or the Schrodinger equation) can be rewritten as a recursive Fourier transformation. \n\nThis approach distinguishes between measurable coordinates, which correspond to physical interactions or endpoints, and unmeasurable parameters, which are non-physical. This distinction is illustrated by a hologram, in which the holographic image you see (coordinate) is distinct from the film in the background (parameters). The result is a holistic view of time, in which the basic element of time is not a point but a line between interactions. Treating time as fundamentally holistic allows one to construct theories which connect present with future, i.e., post-select a given end state to experience a meaningful coincidence or synchronicity in the present time. \n\nMethods: Drawing off two related formalisms—Fourier optics and the Feynman path integral—an equation for wavefunction propagation is presented which reflects the mathematics of holograms. The ontology of this formalism is simple, consisting of spacetime and its Fourier dual. The traditional approach of a spatial wavefunction which is dependent upon the time variable is discarded in favor of a 4-dimensional spacetime distribution (block multiverse) which does not evolve. In spite of the static nature of the block multiverse, equations of motion of a system are encoded as-a-whole into its phase profile. Dynamical change is thus possible even though the wave distribution does not evolve. \n\nDiscussion: Bohm sought to develop quantum mechanics into the implicate and explicate order. Bohm’s structure emerges naturally in this formalism. This is unsurprising because Bohm’s favorite metaphor was the hologram and the Fourier transform, which serve as the basis for the formalism presented here. Just as digital images and audio data can be converted into spaceless and timeless representations, respectively, the implicate order described here is without space or time parameter. The timelessness and spacelessness applies universally and generates fruitful lines of inquiry, such as the retroactive flexibility of histories, as well as the requirement that all physical properties are defined subjectively. \n\nReferences\n\nBohm, D.

This technology allows for capturing “blueprints” of subtle energy, using noise in the region of existing sound waves as their carrier. Dr. Kronn conducted numerous experiments working with different labs at a variety of institutions and showed that products processed with VFT can beneficially affect humans, animals, and plants on the physical, cellular, and even genetic level (Kronn, 2016). In 2017, a new approach using a region of the visible light spectrum, instead of the sound wave range, was put under trial. An experimental setup based on the non-linear qualities of light (Butylkin, 1989)—the Multidimensional Imaging System (MIG)—was created. Various tests demonstrated that MIG Technology is capable of successfully capturing subtle energy blueprints. \n\nMethods: Vital Force Technology (VFT) is capable of capturing a subtle energy pattern coming from the electrically modulated gas discharge of specific inert gasses and of recording this as noise with the help of a high-quality audio-processing system. The subsequent audio signal playback through powerful electromagnets allows for processing a selected sample, providing it with the qualities of the subtle energy blueprints. MIG Technology functionally mimics VFT, with the only difference being, instead of using the sound wave range of frequencies, it works in the region of light spectrum wavelengths. \n\nResults: Four years of a study comparing sound waves with light spectrum waves, when both are used as carriers of subtle energy blueprints, has shown that products created with the help of both methods work the same way. Some samples occurred to be more effective for human well-being when the two methods are combined, especially when the blueprints are taken from plants. MIG Technology has demonstrated greater effectiveness in creating a long-lived macroscopic entanglement. \nDiscussion: One of the driving forces behind both technologies is a well-known model describing how the three-dimensional material world, which science mainly explores, is the last resort of the multi-dimensional Multiverse that “squeezes” itself into the dense condition of our existence. It is hypothesized that the material world is constructed according to the “blueprints” of the higher dimensions that we can call the subtle world. If this is correct, then every object we deal with in the material world has as an integral part of these blueprints. By finding out how to attune to these blueprints, record them, and then impose them enhanced on different objects, we could then be able to beneficially change these objects and their qualities. \n\nDuring his life, Dr. Kronn, experimenting with people known to be sensitive testers, found that some combinations of the gas discharge recorded through specific filters, when modulated with the current of particular frequencies swept with distinct speeds (VFT), can positively affect human mood and health. Experimenting further, he enhanced the effectiveness of his experimental setup configuration by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio using a special filtering system. This allowed Dr. Kronn to record not only a powerful subtle energy signal coming from the gas discharge but also to capture subtle energy blueprints of practically any object. This breakthrough brought forward the necessity of further shielding experiments from environmental noises (Kronn, 2019). \n\nThe next generation of subtle energy technology switched from sound waves to the light spectrum of waves (MIG).

Williams","description":"Introduction: The “arrow of time” is so fundamental to our present language and logic that we may think we can logically rule out retrocausation when in fact the lack of retrocausation was built into the axioms underlying that logic. In the absence of these presuppositions, the existence of retrocausation may be no more self-contradictory than the claim that retrocausation does not exist. (Kafatos & Nassikas, 2011). \n\nEmpirical results have demonstrated a seconds-to-minutes apparently retrocausal effect manifesting as a correlation between the number of photons measured in an optical system and the future duration of that same photon-detection process (Mossbridge, 2019, 2021). This study is an attempt to replicate this effect. \n\nMethods: Hardware and software were developed independently from those of Mossbridge (2019, 2021), but were operated using the same protocol. Briefly, a light source and photon counter were turned on at the beginning of each run, 33 seconds of photon counts were gathered (in 3 11-second cumulative bins), then a quantum-seeded pseudorandom process was used to select the remaining amount of time photons would be counted. After that duration, the light source and photon counter were turned off. Differences in apparatus include photon detection by a single photon counting module (SPCM), pulse counting using a field programmable gate array, random number generation by discrete logic implementation of an 80-bit shift register pseudorandom number generator clocked by muon detections, a LabVIEW program operating the experiment and appending data to a file, and an RC circuit for ramping the detector voltage up and down which is optically isolated from the computer. \n\nResults: Data have been collected from approximately 34000 trials during 1/2 year of continuous operation from July 27, 2020 to Feb 21, 2021 inclusive. Analysis is in progress. \n\nDiscussion: “Post Selection” experiments have demonstrated time symmetry in the evolution of quantum-mechanical systems and are congruent with the standard model of quantum physics (Aharonov et al., 2015). Those experiments support the possibility of apparent retrocausation and show a connection between the direction of causality (arrow of entropic time) and the boundary conditions of the system. Conceivably therefore, such a relationship might be turned around creating what one might call a “time telescope” whereby measurements of retrocausal effects allow us to observe boundary conditions that may be distant in time. \n\nReferences\n\nAharonov, Y., Cohen, E., Waegell, M., & Elitzur, A.

What is information? Those, to me, are the two great mysteries. After 50 years of experimentation research studying consciousness, I have come to this conclusion. Max Planck and many of his colleagues in the German school who created modern physics were correct. Consciousness is causal and fundamental. Spacetime arises from consciousness not consciousness from spacetime. It is not a new idea, but today, for the first time, we are able to use experimental science to test our ideas about it. It has always been a fundamental belief. The world is created by nonlocal consciousness as an expression of intention. However, humanity has formulated that concept across time, culture, and geography, whether in religious or secular terms. Scriptures the world over begin with this predicate, the only difference being the description of the intender and the cultural context.

Since the advent of quantum mechanics, zero-point energy (ZPE) has tantalized the scientific community with its huge store of energy, which has appeared to be a fixture of nature but not something that could be extracted. Here, I describe why this energy has appeared to be inaccessible and then provide the keys to unlocking it. \n\nBackground: In 1911, Planck presented his second theory for the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation resulting from material at a particular temperature to account for observed spectra. It included two terms, a temperature dependent term, and a second, temperature independent term that became known as the quantum vacuum or ZPE radiation. Decades later, with the development of quantum theory, this ZPE was again proposed, but this time as a result of the quantum uncertainty principle, an explanation that can be easily understood. Today most of the physics community invokes the uncertainty principle as the justification for ZPE. Perhaps because it is seen as existing to satisfy a physical principle instead of, say, the result of a physical interaction, it is viewed as a fixture of nature. Such a fixture is unalterable and therefore not available for extraction. Beyond this mindset, I give three physical reasons ZPE should not be available for extraction. \n\nArguments against the possibility of zero-point energy extraction: \n\n1. Need for a difference to induce flow. Just as heat flow requires a temperature difference to drive it, so too would ZPE require a difference to drive it. Since ZPE is the universal ground state, it would appear impossible to provide a difference in its level. \n2. Equilibrium and detailed balance. In equilibrium all transitions between two sites or energy levels are balanced by the opposite transitions, a process called detailed balance. Since ZPE is considered to be in equilibrium, even if we could induce a flow, it would be balanced by an equal flow in the opposite direction, as part of the detailed balance concept. \n3. Perhaps most fundamentally, energy extraction from a system in equilibrium would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, arguably the most sacrosanct principle in physics. \n\nWe have designed, fabricated, and tested over a thousand of these devices, and found real energy extraction. After carrying out eight different types of verifications of the measured response, we found no artifacts that can explain away the results (Moddel et al., 2021a). We measured even larger effects on the resistance of the samples (Moddel et al., 2021b). It is still possible that another, non-ZPE cause for the observations will be found, but in the absence of that the following appear to be the keys to unlocking ZPE: \n\n1. A Casimir cavity is an optical cavity in which the density of vacuum ZPE modes is reduced compared to outside of the cavity. The commonly associated energy is due to the Casimir force, an attraction that appears between the mirrors of the cavity. We instead use this cavity to induce an asymmetry that produces a net flow of electrons through the Casimir photoinjector. \n2. It has been argued that a small amount of energy may be borrowed from the background ZPE for a very short time (Ford, 1991). We break the detailed balance by capturing the electrons in femtoseconds (10–15 seconds), before the borrowed energy can return to its source. This is accomplished with extremely fast transit of electrons through nanometer layers in the Casimir photoinjector, and essentially bilks the system out of some of its ZPE. \n3. More than any other factor, the possible violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics by the Casimir photoinjector is the main reason for the deep skepticism of our results by the physics community. By redefining equilibrium to incorporate spatial variations in ZPE, it may be possible to reconcile our results with the Second Law. \n\nReferences\n\nFord, L. H. (1991).

Cutchin (2020) recently speculates on numerous ways that the two fields might relate, proposing a phenomenon of “wildnisgeist,” or “poltergeists of the woods” (although I think the more literal “waldgeist” would be clearer and sound better). Reinterpreting what Bigfoot researchers commonly call “class B” reports (i.e., reports of events consistent with alleged Bigfoot behavior but lacking an actual sighting) as potential poltergeist phenomena, Cutchin produces a laundry list of ostensible similarities, including “thrown stones, raps, disembodied voices, anomalous odors, frightened pets, apports, electrical interference, and anomalous lights” (p.10). Cutchin poses a number of logical explanations for these relationships, yet seems to see no path forward towards testing or assessing their vitality. In this paper, I offer a more logical means of parsing alleged poltergeist occurrences from Bigfoot accounts in order to facilitate scientifically testing potential poltergeist phenomena.  \n\nMethods: This is an exploratory study based on qualitative data from interviews and ethnographic fieldwork. \n\nDiscussion: My own speculation on a poltergeist explanation of some alleged Bigfoot reports arose from a number of firsthand accounts I heard from amateur Bigfoot investigators. A minority of reports included details that were qualitatively distinct from most “class B” reports as well as logically inconsistent with biological models of even potential primate range and behavior. For example, in place of the standard rock-throwing, a behavior both reported in numerous Bigfoot eyewitness accounts and also consistent with known primate behavior, certain witnesses reported being showered instead with tiny pebbles. Pebble tossing mirrors the act of rock-throwing but utterly lacks the presumed intent of intimidation. These reports seem to cluster in locations far less likely to provide habitat or cover for a large, elusive species. For example, one experiencer encouraged me to join him in attempting a Bigfoot encounter in an urban tract of “woods” that appeared to be only about an acre or two in size. The experiencers of these qualitatively different reports furthermore tend to have numerous encounters, far more frequent than most amateur investigators. For example, I accompanied one such eyewitness on a fruitless nighttime investigation, after which he claimed that he had previously “always” experienced Bigfoot across many visits to that location. That same witness later shared with me descriptions and photographic evidence of a physical nature, but “evidence” that was easily explained as misidentification of natural and normal aspects of the environment. While misidentification, imagination, and/or fabrication could account for all of these reports, the apparent sincerity of the witnesses – as well as the correlation of their unusual and unlikely details – led me to consider a more charitable explanation. The further correlation of these reports with common aspects of poltergeist activity suggests potential origins in unconscious psi or RSPK, not the least notably that they are repeated phenomena occurring in the presence of only certain human experients. \n\nRather than shrug our shoulders at where the potential line, if any, may be drawn between possible Bigfoot and poltergeist experiences, I encourage parapsychological focus on cases fitting this particular profile, which is almost certainly not reconcilable with any conceivably natural Bigfoot species. This allows for at least a research question that is clear and singularly focused: Are these experiences human RSPK phenomena? If so, then they may offer psi researchers a wonderful opportunity to study poltergeist phenomena that are longer lasting than most domestic manifestations. On the other hand, the ethics of investigating a phenomenon other than that reported by and of interest to the experients must be carefully navigated. \n\nReference\n\nCutchin, J. (2020).

Our study has recruited a sample of 21 people who have experienced this phenomenon and asked them to answer a 95-item questionnaire regarding their experiences. What our research was trying to investigate is the nature of ADC using cell phones, the mechanisms through which the communication occurs, variations of the incidences, as well as how extensive the phenomenon is. The questionnaire detailed different aspects of the incidences to pin-point patterns, common reoccurrences, and to begin the exploration of these occurrences in hopes of understanding their nature and how they can possibly be replicated. On June 25th, 2020 our questionnaire, consisting of three measures, was posted onto the ITC group on Facebook. The 95-item survey was sent out specifically to this Facebook group, as its members identify as frequent practitioners of instrumental transcommunication using numerous devices, ultimately sharing their results and experiences with the rest of the group. \n\nMethods\nParticipants: Participants consisted of 21 individuals recruited from posting our debrief form on the ITC Facebook group page on June 25th, 2020. There were 16 women and five men (N= 21), 16 of them were over 55 years old. \n\nMaterials: A consent letter was provided to the participants. It included a description of the study and detailed the potential risks and discomforts associated with it, the benefits, anonymity, and right to withdraw at any time. \n\nMeasures: Three measures were included in the study, which were six demographics question, an After-Death Communication Questionnaire developed by the researchers, and Carol Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being. The After-Death Communication Questionnaire consisted of 41 Likert type items varying from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” regarding the nature of ADC via cellphone devices, along with the impact of these instances on the individual and their perception of the sender and experience. Carol Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being questionnaire was used as a measure of psychological well-being of the participants, looking into six different areas of well-being measured by the Ryff inventory, which are Autonomy, Environmental Mastery, Personal Growth, Positive Relations with Others, Purpose in Life, and Self-Acceptance. Each one of these items was scored on a six-point Likert scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). \n\nResults: Findings show our participants scored higher on the Personal Growth scale of the Ryff inventory than the norm (df = 8504, t = 2.969, p =0.0015). This finding is statistically significant and suggests that our participants have a greater interest in self-development and openness to new experiences. As well, different mechanisms of after-death communication were reported by our participants through self-assessment measures. The most frequent of these mechanisms were telephone calls, photos or videos showing up on cell phones, text messages, non-vocal sounds during telephone calls or on voicemail, and voice during telephone calls. Our study also includes participants’ descriptions of their experiences, which will be shown in the presentation. \n\nDiscussion: The findings of our study highlight the different types of mechanisms through which after-death communication can occur on cell phones. This changes the perception of after-death communication and suggests that communication can occur with regular cellphones without the need for creating dedicated EVP and ITC devices.\n\nReferences\nRyff, C., & Keyes, C.

Frank at the University of Iowa announced that the Earth was being showered every minute by small comets that break up and deposit large clouds of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. This wasn’t mere speculation; the evidence came from images taken by the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft. Frank faced an avalanche of criticism from fellow astronomers, geologists, and geophysicists. But a few scientists who were intent on proving him wrong actually confirmed his discovery. Then in the 1990s, images from two instruments on another spacecraft named Polar provided “vindication” of his original discovery. \n\nThis talk will attempt to present some of the evidence for the existence of the small comets and explain my role in the story. It will not detail the extensive controversy, which is covered in detail in the new book \"Cosmic Rain: The Controversial Discovery of Small Comets\" by Louis A. Frank.  \n\nPatrick Huyghe is a writer, editor, publisher, and television producer.

We contrast the first part of his theory with plate tectonics and true polar wander and propose a new mechanism that is triggered by short-term reversals of the geomagnetic field that “unlock” the crust from the mantle, driven by earth–moon–sun tidal forces, the same forces that move earth’s oceans. It is shown that by combining a modified version of the second part of Hapgood’s theory with elements of existing climate theories it may be possible to account for periodic sea-level changes associated with the buildup and melting of polar ice over past glacial cycles with a combination of Milanković cycles and Hapgood pole shifts.\n\nRead the full paper at: https://journalofscientificexploration.org/index.php/jse/article/view/1621\n\nLive participation in SSE Community Discussion Hours is a benefit of membership in the Society for Scientific Exploration.

Or is life a cosmic phenomenon ubiquitous throughout the galaxy as well as among the many billions of galaxies in the observable universe? Prof. Wickramasinghe states that evidence from astronomy, geology, and biology is overwhelmingly in favor of the latter -  life being a truly cosmic phenomenon.  \n\nLife started on the Earth 4.2 billion years ago with the arrival of microorganisms from comets, and its subsequent evolution was directed by the continuing arrival of bacterial/viral material from space. The reason why this suite of ideas is not yet widely accepted is connected with cultural issues more than science.  We are led to believe that from the beginning of the enlightenment in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries CE, science has moved forward with an abandonment of all forms of irrational prejudice. \n\nWhile we are aware that socio-cultural factors control large areas of science, particularly with regard to the allocation of public funds, we often forget to assess the consequent societal damage. This is true, particularly in relation to the biggest questions of science such as the origin of life and the origin of the Universe. In the interests of science, it is important to recognize the role of such influences in the assessment of competing theories, particularly those relating to the origin of life.  \n\nLive participation in SSE Community Discussion Hours is a benefit of membership in the Society for Scientific Exploration.

of Healing Energy on Human DNA In-Vitro","description":"Effect of Healing Energy on Human DNA in-vitro and Ability of Various Carries to Store Healing Energy\nGlen Rein\nQuantum Biology Research Lab, MA, USA\n\nIntroduction: Previous studies by the author indicated Healing Arts Practitioners could change the conformation of human DNA in-vitro by measuring the winding and unwinding of the two strands. Here these studies are extended to measure the electrical conductivity of human DNA using non-linear dielectric spectroscopy (NLDS). The direct effect of healers was studied as well as indirect effects from healing energy emitted from objects like water, crystals and essential oils which had been previously exposed to the same healing energy. \n\nElectrical conductivity of DNA has been well studied using single molecules where it has been shown that electrons and protons propagate outside and within the central channel of double-stranded DNA molecules. Such conductivity occurs via two mechanisms – classical electron hopping and quantum electron tunneling. Under resonance conditions, the latter mechanism predominates. Resonance conditions were established by measuring conductivity at a resonance frequency of DNA, rather than an arbitrary fixed frequency using by most conductivity meters. A resonance frequency of 1.58kHz for double-stranded human DNA was used for all conductivity measures using NLDS. Conductivity measurements taken at this frequency are extremely sensitive to the subtle perturbations of the DNA molecule whether they be chemical or energetic in nature. Some types of energy increase the electrical conductivity, whereas others decrease it. Here all data is expressed as a percent change relative to untreated controls done on the same day before any energies were generated in the lab. Control changes, in the absence of any energetic intervention, are usually around 10-20%. \n\nFour different healers, using four different techniques, were tested and shown to increase conductivity of human DNA from 20 to 50%. Similar changes, but somewhat weaker, were observed when the healers treated water or crystals which could store their energy. In some experiments, four different types of crystals were exposed to the same healing energy. The next day a stock solution of DNA was placed adjacent to the tip of the crystal and the conductivity measured after one hour. Compared to untreated controls, the energy from some crystals increased the conductivity of the DNA, but the energy from other crystals caused the conductivity to decrease. \n\nWhen the treated water was added to the stock DNA solution or the stock solution was placed adjacent to an energy-emitting crystal, complex changes in the conductivity measures were observed. The changes were reproducible in subsequent trials, although the magnitude of the effects varied from trial to trial. The energy was stored in the water lattice and the crystal structures for about 2 months, gradually decreasing in magnitude from week to week. \n\nIn another series of tests, the DNA was initially damaged by pre-exposure to cell phone radiation. After being damaged, the DNA was left to recover (for an hour) by itself (no intervention) or in the presence of an energy-emitted crystal. The stored healing energy had a marked effect on the recovering DNA molecules. In one experiment, for example, after damage, conductivity of DNA increased by 25% with no intervention, but increased by 49% in the presence of stored healing energy.

Moreover, big data analytics are likely needed to describe the important interactions among attitudinal, normative, and environmental variables that likely mediate percipients’ reports. The growth of social, mobile, cloud and multi-media computing can now support robust “citizen science” campaigns. Accordingly, we developed MESA 3.0 ― an android application that conducts site-specific mapping. This “app” is the next-gen version of early MESA systems (Harte et al., 1999; Houran et al., 1998) and was designed to document and quantify anomalous experiences in real-time for cross-correlation with time-synced environmental readings. \n\nMethod: MESA 3.0 uses the sensors in mobile devices to measure GMF 3-axis, Lighting Levels, Temperature, Barometric Pressure, and Gravity/Acceleration. Data are collected at five samples per second, creating mini-packets of 25 readings every five seconds. Environmental data, audio, and pictures are aggregated, logged, and displayed to users via descriptive statistics and automatically saved in shareable files, which allow for uploading with a corresponding cloud-based data repository. The app further documents the installed sensor type, sensitivity, and resolution. Inclusion of the new Survey of Strange Events (SSE: Houran et al., 2019) also facilitates standardized comparisons of percipients' reports across environmental settings. We field-tested MESA 3.0’s four functional modes (i.e., Baseline, Freestyle, Sentinel, and EVP-Knock) via an exercise with volunteers who collected (a) baseline readings of their residences, (b) a baseline of a public area, and (c) baseline readings at a reputed “haunt.”\n \nResults: The app performed as designed — environmental data were easily retrieved, compared against photographs and SSE scores, as well as automatically stored and available to download for statistical analysis. We noted some variability across different mobile devices, but overall, the environmental readings and investigation protocol were stable across users and hardware. Thus, the app was an effective method to obtain “environmental and experiential maps” of settings associated with anomalous experiences. \n\nDiscussion: MESA 3.0 is a user-friendly mobile lab that can be used in research designs involving citizen scientists. I.S.R.A.E will host and maintain the application’s platform and open-access data repository. Our intention is to engage several thousand enthusiasts to create the largest documented set of public data for “haunted, sacred or enchanted” locations to date. As such, we hope this effort can help to mend antagonistic relationships between parapsychologists and ghost-hunters (Hill et al., 2018, 2019; Houran, 2017) by introducing this tool to amateur paranormal groups for structured and productive future collaborations between the two camps. Collaboration for further application and refinement of MESA 3.0 is open and welcome. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Richards\nAtlantic University, Virginia Beach, VA, USA\n\nIntroduction: The Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) is a signal processing algorithm for extremely weak radio signals. Much anomalies research also tries to detect extremely weak signals: psi, global consciousness, geomagnetic field effects, and other anomalous biological/psychological phenomena. Studies using WSPR provide a useful methodological comparison for other studies of weak signals. WSPR may also be applied directly to studies of anomalies involving the effects of the geomagnetic field and ionospheric resonances on biological systems. WSPR uses free software available on the Internet, and WSPRnet is a global, free shared database of WSPR data. \n\nDiscussion: The intended application of WSPR is to explore the effects of phenomena like geomagnetic field variability, time of day, sunspots, time of year, sidereal time, etc. on radio propagation. These same variables may affect human behavior and rhythms including psi and health (Alabdulgader et al., 2018; Krippner & Persinger, 1996; Spottiswoode, 1997). Direct measurement of geomagnetic/solar phenomena requires expensive equipment, is generally conducted at only a few stations around the world, and is not usually available at a fine temporal or spatial resolution. In contrast, WSPR has a network of hundreds of transmitters and receivers around the world; for receiving, anyone can contribute to the database; for transmitting, an amateur radio license is required. The database itself is completely open and there are websites with tools for statistical analysis. \n\nOne of the challenges in weak signal/high noise research is that uncontrollable noise plays a major role (in contrast to many fields of laboratory research where the noise can be controlled). WSPR was developed by physicist Joe Taylor at Princeton University to address this problem in radio communication. WSPR measures the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of extremely weak signals, with a threshold 31 dB below the noise floor (in other words, signals that normally would not be detected at all). For example, using only 0.1 watt in the 40 meter ham radio band, I am heard clearly in Antarctica, over 14000 km away. \n\nI will use a rebuttal to one of the criticisms of psi research as an example of the application of this principle. A frequent skeptical argument against the reality of psi is that it does not obey the “inverse square law,” that the magnitude of a force declines with the square of the distance (e.g., Reber & Alcock, 2019). It is true that some psi effects seem to be unrelated to distance, at least over terrestrial distances. However, the skeptical argument is completely spurious because in communication, it is the signal-to-noise ratio, not the magnitude of the signal, which is relevant. \n\nThe SNR of my signal in Antarctica is similar to that in California, Texas, England, and nearby Norfolk – just like psi, there is no apparent dependence on distance. WSPR can’t be used directly in psi research, since we do not even know if psi is a signal, or what the noise level may be. But this illustrates a way of thinking about weak signal research. \nWSPR can be applied directly to measurements in other areas of anomalies research. In particular, it can measure variables likely to be relevant in the study of the effects of solar weather and geomagnetic fields on biology and psychology. Alabdulgader et al. (2018) and McCraty et al. (2012) have demonstrated a coupling between the human nervous system and resonating geomagnetic frequencies. They have used a small network of measurement sites, separated by thousands of miles and typically with a time resolution of at best 3 hours. These can provide a broad picture, but WSPR can explore correlates of the same variables on a much finer temporal and spatial scale. For example, propagation changes during developing geomagnetic storms can be measured at 2-minute intervals by hundreds of worldwide stations, with results posted immediately to the Internet. \n\nConclusion: WSPR offers methodological insights for dealing with weak signal/high noise environments, and potential practical measurement capabilities for anomalies research. WSPR is an outstanding example of completely open research participation and shared data.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The position pushes against the standard anthropomorphic and ego-centered position found in science, religions, and philosophy and reveals a more cohesive narrative that supports inclusion rather than separateness. \n\nEssentially, microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are responsible for terraforming the planet for their benefit. The soil, atmosphere, and water of our environment are created and maintained by them. We, as humans, are extensions of this activity and can be positioned as “microbial transport systems” since we are completely dependent on their actions both externally and internally and physically carry them throughout the various planetary and space environments. We cannot even perform basic physiology such as digestion without them-and actually live off the waste byproducts of their digestion. The cells within a body that are classified as human (blood, nerve, tissue, etc.) are also “independent” life forms since they are not solely dependent on the original body for existence or sustenance. Blood, tissues, and organs can be transferred from one person to another without loss of function or viability. These same cells can also be kept alive in-vitro, without a body or organic host required. This condition of recognizing the collective synergy of cells within a human form opens the door to challenging the standard model of what a human is. \n\nHumans have 1000s of years of pondering the meaning of life and trying to understand the processes of Nature without incorporating microbes into the paradigms. We have only become “aware” of microbes for 200 years, yet they have been present nearly since the beginning of the planet. Science has only positioned the presence of microbes within humans as symbiotic recently in the 20th Century, overcoming the early trend of classifying all microbes as pathogenic. \n\nWith the advent of electron microscopy, we now realize that 90% of the cells (the building blocks of the human form) are microbial in nature and “not human”. This fact should make everyone reconsider what it means to be “human”. With the latest research of the field of Psychobiotics revealing that simply altering the microbiome within the human digestive tract through probiotics results in changing the thoughts and feelings of the individual, then the autonomy of Ego with regards to consciousness needs to be examined. There are numerous reports of microbes directly affecting the functions and behaviors of animals, such as with t.gondi and mice. The presence of t.gondi in a mouse causes it to be attracted to cat urine and changes survival behavior so that it will be eaten by a cat. This purposeful alteration of the mouse benefits t.gondi since it requires the cat as a host to complete its life cycle. We fail to extend this potential to humans due to our conditioned hubris and anthropocentric defining of Nature, yet examples of these relationships are prevalent throughout nature with all complex organisms and microbes. \n\nRecognizing the paradigm of cellular connections and relationships throughout Nature, it offers a potential explanation for the transmission of non-local information within parapsychology. We are just discovering the communication process and network of microorganisms called Quorum Sensing. It is possible through this communication system that information is relayed beyond the standard accepted norm. Instead of looking for a meta-physical answer to many manifestations of what are characterized as parapsychological expressions, possibly Quorum Sensing could account for some of the occurrences or exhibition of these experiences. Many of the parapsychology artifacts such as psychic intuition and past-life experiences could be a result of microbial information storage and transmission and fall under the domain of science rather than being labeled mystical or spiritual. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The answer is related to the basic structure for the creation of matter, the torus. Through testing, resonance with the energy of centering and harmony is embedded in the torus structure. The energy is within the numbers of 3, 6, and 9. The same energy is also within the key symbols associated with creation: the Sanskrit Aum, the Chinese Bagua, the yin yang symbol, the Reiki power symbol, and Marko Rodin’s torus as represented mathematically within his Vortex Math. The BioGeometry BG3 quality is embedded in the symbols, but the energy is not BG3 but a new energy which can be detected by a new tool in resonance with the 3-6-9 subtle energy. \n\nIn the field of plasma physics, there are monatomic elements, often known as Ormus and GANS (Gas in the Nano State), and the fourth state of matter. To date, there has been no good way to detect these elements. The tools used to measure 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities will detect and measure the energies of these monatomic elements. GANS has the qualities/properties of the torus structure. Different geometric patterns of GANS will also create fields that have BG3 and 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities. These energy qualities can be moved with conscious intention. The movement can be measured. The moved energies can be shown to activate water. \n\nUnderstanding the energies and our abilities to work and change them gives us more information as to who we are and how we are all connected. \n\nMethods: The tools to measure resonance from the fields of BioGeometry and Radiesthesia were used to detect and quantitate subtle energies qualities. The BG16 tool from BioGeometry was used to detect and measure BG3 (BioGeometry 3). A new tool will be described which detects and measures the 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities. The BG3 Ruler was used to quantitate energies. The GANS/ormus, was prepared by adjusting pH of a solution of Dead Sea Salt. Vials of Ormus were used to create BG3 and 3-6-9 fields. The torus and creation symbols were drawn using the knowledge of spiral motion in the vortex of the torus. \n\nResults: The torus structure, the 3,6,9 within the structure, the symbols of Aum, Yin Yan Reiki Power Symbol, Bagua, and Rodin’s Symbol of Enlightenment showed both BG3 and 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities. The drawing of the symbols brings forth the BG3 and 3-6-9 qualities. The symbols will then have harmonizing qualities. \n\nGANS materials have 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities, but not BG3. However, the fields that are created from geometric patterns from vials of GANS produce fields which contain both BG3 and 3-6-9 subtle energies. These energies were shown to activate water, as evidenced by the increase of BG3 levels of the water. It was also shown that, with consciousness, the fields created by either symbols of creation or with GANS vials, could be moved to different locations. The energy in the new locations was shown to be able to activate water. \n\nDiscussion: The results have a number of key implications. The results support the concept of creation being connected to the double torus structure. Both the BG3 and 3-6-9 subtle energy qualities have harmonizing qualities, which are a precursor for healing. The results also will accelerate growth in the study of GANS since GANS can now be detected with the 3-6-9 tool, and the fields created by GANS will now be able to be measured. There is now further evidence as to consciousness/intention being able interact with matter and fields by the evidence in this presentation. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

However, in the last few years, there has been growing evidence concerning a biological basis that can allow for psychic functioning. I have identified nine possible situations from which people consider they have obtained psychic abilities, grouped into four categories:\n\n1. Hereditary. Some people are said to be “psychic-born,” though sometimes the appearance of psychic abilities occurs in a later stage of their lives . A genetic component could be argued if some of their blood relatives also possess psychic abilities, which is usually the case. \n2. Stressful. Refers to both psychological and cellular stress. The sources of psi that fall within this category are Unidentified Aerial Phenomena encounters, Near-Death Experiences , deep psychological traumas (i.e., poltergeist cases), and being struck by lightning like some shamans . \n3. Directed. People who have never had any type of psychic ability and, through training, manage to succeed at psi tasks; for example, people from the STARGATE project categorized as “normal, nonpsychic individuals”, and meditators who spontaneously experience psi phenomena. \n4. Induced. This is usually achieved by taking psychedelic substances, such as DMT, LSD, or mescaline, among others. \nThe latter three categories involve situations that have a physiological effect on the individuals. So it seems likely that the different roads to supernormal abilities involve some common biochemical, regulatory, and/or epigenetic features. \n\nApproach: Let us assume that there is a biological trait, most likely a brain structure, responsible for the experience and performance of psi phenomena. Considering the different scenarios by which people report acquiring such abilities, it is highly improbable that a different structure is involved in each case. Indeed, the most likely scenario involves the physiological convergence into a single brain region, perhaps the extra connections in the caudate-putamen area. Furthermore, we would expect it to be the same structure in “psychic-born” people and in those who do not inherit psychic abilities but acquire theme during their lifetimes. This suggests that the difference between inheritance and acquisition has more to do with genetic (or epigenetic) regulation than with being born with the “right genes.” \n\nProposal: A possible mechanism that could account for psi development is genetic compensation. In many cases, mutants for an essential trait do not show deleterious effects. This is achieved because, somehow, another gene (or genes) is compensating for the loss of function. This means that there are different “roads” that lead to the same phenotype, which rely on the activation of regulatory pathways that lead to different gene expression patterns so that the individual keeps its robustness and develops normally. \n\nI propose two scenarios that relate to the appearance of psi. “Psychic-born” people possess specific genes that are expressed normally, perhaps in a specific brain region, which in turn favors an innate development of anomalous cognition and/or perturbation. On the other hand, “non-psychic-born” individuals may go through situations during their lifetime which effects are known to produce deep physiological modifications (i.e., Stressful, Directed, or Induced). These can lead to alteration of gene expression patterns in a way that could resemble genetic compensation through epigenetic changes and/or pathways involving different kinds of RNA molecules. Such modifications in gene expression may ultimately be reflected in a modification of the brain region that permits psychic functioning, which is most likely the same as in “psychic-born” individuals.\n \nConclusion: Recent studies with people prone to events that involve anomalous cognition are beginning to shed some light in what a biological basis for supernormality might be. Although a hereditary component seems to be involved, when we consider the different situations leading to psi development it seems unlikely that it all relies in specific gene variants (polymorphisms). Here, I have proposed a plausible mechanism that could allow the acquisition of psi talent through different scenarios. It involves changes in neuronal connectivity through modifications of gene expression patterns, induced by a wide range of situations. These findings, in combination with state-of-the-art methodologies in genetics, neuroimaging, and “omics” technologies, could allow us to have a better understanding of why psychic abilities arise in the first place, and why there is a large gradient of them when comparing different people.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWlS8Mv-E2Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWlS8Mv-E2Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWlS8Mv-E2Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWlS8Mv-E2Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWlS8Mv-E2Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Society for Scientific Exploration","playlistId":"UUEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA","position":82,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nWlS8Mv-E2Q"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Society for Scientific Exploration","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"1NPf1by7ZZhc-XS8uvvgyi8qmys","id":"VVVFSVhtYWJ3X1VoU1dUdlRTNmZ0c3VBLm14bmRxV1BjREtJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-18T11:00:32Z","channelId":"UCEIXmabw_UhSWTvTS6ftsuA","title":"The Vibrational World of Subtle Energy","description":"We, Like Everything Around Us, Function Under Two Sets of the Laws of Nature\nOlga Strashun \nStrashun Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\nIntroduction: This paper explores an innovative system and is based on 30 years of assembling information through personal observation, experimentation and practical application of the ways in which the vibrational world of Subtle Energy (SE) operates and manifests in every aspect of our life. \n\nWe, like everything around us, function under two sets of the Laws of Nature. One comes from the world of solidity and seemingly separate things. In this world, our bodies are born and eventually stop functioning. These Laws of Nature are well researched. The other is from the domain of the vibrational world of Subtle Energy where the subject is not much known. \n\nThe principles of nature operating in the vibrational world of SE are very different to those we studied in school and were conditioned to follow in our life. When we know, to some extent, how SE functions, our understanding of the world and human nature is enormously enhanced. If we apply this knowledge to our everyday life and work, we will have the tools to: \n● get objective information on something we want to know about that is not tainted by our subjective feelings, \n● receive guidance anytime and anywhere in finding solutions to our problems, especially in situations with incomplete information,\n● analyze people’s nature and, even without meeting them, understand their nature, abilities, and how those abilities are being used, \n● analyze the dynamics between people in different environments (family, working), with minimal information, \n● and much more. \nThis novel and innovative system presents a systematic picture of how SE differs from other types of energy and manifestation of its principles in every aspect of being, where: \n● on the deepest level of reality, we are all made from the same matter and interconnected, \n● SE is not electromagnetic or gravitational in nature, \n● thoughts are Energy and affect matter, \n● everything vibrates, the quality of vibrations is important information, \n● notion of emptiness and locality does not exist, \n● in a form of vibrations nothing disappears, but stays forever and everywhere, \n● past, present and future exist at the same time, \n● information about everything is coded in vibrations and available anytime and anyplace, and much more. \n\nMethods: At the present time, there is no technology available to register, measure or produce Subtle Energy (SE). The only way to learn about its properties is to analyze the results achieved in experiments and assess information related to the subject that comes to our attention from our professional and daily life. \n\nMy system of how Subtle Energy works and interpretation of information coded in vibrations started in 1987 at a research laboratory founded by the USSR Ministry of Space. At the laboratory, Subtle Energy was studied in depth on how and where to use its properties and was also applied in the selection and training of astronauts. As an MD working at the emergency ward, I started to experiment with diagnosing patients using 3-D “holograms” of organs. I was using statistics to compare my findings with a traditional way to come to diagnosis – collecting a history of a disease, tests, result of surgeries, etc. What was even a heresy to think about, turned out to become a reality. With Dr Polyakov, the head of the Laboratory, I participated in evaluating the health of 80 top managers of a large industrial company, where the two of us had to come up with independent conclusions. Our diagnoses were then compared to the managers health files. Findings showed that our results were 93% identical and were over 80% in agreement with their files. I also participated in experiments proving a non-electromagnetic nature of Subtle Energy as well as the effect of a mental program on changing EEGs. In other experiments, mental programming was used to improve the outcome of experiments. I continued my research and experimentation on Subtle Energy in Toronto, Canada for another thirty plus years. My findings have been reflected in my book Subtle Energy: Information to Enhance, Guide, and Heal. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Our research institute had the privilege of caring for a Buddha relic from a recently deceased Buddhist Lama. Buddha relics are crystal-like objects that are purportedly found among the cremated ashes of Buddhist spiritual masters. Because these objects are believed to emanate subtle energy, we were interested to test the ability of professional clairvoyants to detect the presence of the Buddha relic without visual cues. \n\nMethods: A perception test was conducted with seven subjects, one at a time: four self-identified clairvoyants who provide related professional services in the community (referred to as Seers), and three laboratory staff who do not consider themselves to possess clairvoyant skills (as control subjects). Strict blinding procedures were used to ensure that staff could not convey cues related to the test. Prior to the start of each test, a Research Assistant (RA) placed the relic in an opaque container in the center of a table inside an electromagnetically shielded room. Ten identical, empty containers were lined up behind the first container and labeled numerically. After the RA was out of the room and out of sight, the Principal Investigator (PI) escorted the subject into the room to sense any energetic characteristics perceptible from the relic inside the first container-, without opening the lid or touching the container (Figure 1). \n\nAfter 5 minutes of the subject becoming familiar with the sensations associated with relic inside the first container, the PI escorted the subject out of the building while the RA returned to the room and moved the relic into one of the numbered containers (chosen according to the output of a random number generator). The RA also lifted the lid of each of the other nine containers so as to equalize the amount of physical manipulation of the containers. After the RA was out of the room and out of sight again, the PI escorted the subject into the room and monitored while the subject tried to detect which container held the relic without opening or touching any of the containers. Once the choice was recorded, the PI escorted the subject out of the room so that the test could be repeated for a total of 10 trials. The number of trials was chosen to allow for sufficient statistical power when making a choice of one out of ten, based on previously reported methods (Yount et al., 2004).\n\nResults: During the period when the subjects were becoming familiar with the sensations associated with relic inside the first container, all of the Seers reported discernable energetic perceptions that were distinct from the empty containers. None of the control subjects reported discernable energetic perceptions. The results of the ten test trials were at the level expected by chance for all subjects (see Table A). \n Control Group Seer Group\nAverage % Correct Choices 13.3 +/- 3.3 7.5 +/- 2.5\nTable A Average Percentage of Correct Choices\nDiscussion: While preliminary and inconclusive, we found no evidence that clairvoyant seers were able to detect the presence of the Buddha relic without visual cues. The lack of discernment may be an indication that the subtle energy associated with the relic emanates in space too far to be distinguished from an empty container near the relic (within 2 feet), or that it leaves traces in the containers that linger and confound subsequent trials. The fact that the seers reported discernable energetic perceptions that were distinct from the empty containers highlights the need to maximize the signal to noise ratio for measures tests of subtle energy perception. Other interpretations of the data will be discussed.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

For the spiritual to have effects in nature, and make a difference, the physical laws of nature must be modified or extended. Many thinkers in centuries past have proposed physics extensions to allow minds to operate, but to keep energy conservation at the same time. For example, actions of mind could be limited to biased probabilities in quantum mechanics (Beck, 2008), or to varying times of the chance events (Stapp, 2006). But quantum chances affect very little in organisms. Others suggest that minds could move energy from one location to a nearby place but that does not conserve energy locally. Non-local entanglement could be used, though it cannot be used for signals.\n\nApproach: I propose that the fine-tuned parameters of quantum field theory (masses and charges) can be varied locally in order to achieve ends in nature. This is not adding extra forces to nature but rescaling the forces which already exist. The unit of electric charge e is built into the fine-structure constant α=e^2/ℏc  ~ 1/137. Some physicists (Webb et al, 2001, 2011) have already proposed varying α slowly over the age of the universe. Some kind of variation, therefore, is conceivable in physics. Now, we propose to vary it over micro-seconds and within living organisms. \n\nBekenstein (1982, 2002) showed that very similar effects to charge variations can be obtained by varying instead the permittivity ε at the position of either charge (ε_1 or ε_2) while keeping charges constant. In our new application, ε is varied not just in dielectrics, but varies evenly in a vacuum. The magnetic permeability μ is varied inversely so the speed of light c=1/√εμ remains constant. By Noether’s theorem, energy and momentum are not now locally conserved, so the effects should be observable if measured in the needed scale of times and distances for molecular processes in cells. We can still do physics calculations by using forces between objects i and j varying by ε(r,t) in \nF_ij=1/8π (1/ε(r_i,t) +1/ε(r_j,t) )  〖q_i q〗_j/〖|r_i-r_j |〗^2 \nImplementing Mental Targets: First, we separate metric time in 4 dimensions from process time as with the order of actualization of potentialities. I have shown in (Thompson, 2019, 2020) how iterative forward and reverse steps in metric time can be used to influence intermediate variations in the vacuum permittivity to move charged bodies to achieve specific targets at a later time. This is analogous to processes of mental planning.\n\nDiscussion: This a start of a theory for how mental or spiritual influx could have effects in nature. Furthermore, these effects on permittivity should be measurable in biophysics experiments. With this proposal, we see after some centuries how ‘final causes’ could once again be seen active in nature. This is by bringing the physical future into line with a target and doing so without time travel and without altering the historical past. Thus, we can imagine how the physical universe is no longer ‘causally closed’ and that a much greater range of scientific explanations should be possible. A wide range of phenomena could be amenable to (generalized) causal explanations.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org...\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Heraclitus and Epicurus believed it to be a special kind of matter, the latter even suggested that the soul is made of atoms. Some philosophers put forward the idea that it could also be responsible for sense perception and emotions.  About the same time, similar ideas of the soul sprung from Chinese philosophers who also believed that the soul is what distinguishes the dead and the living. \n\nThe modern scientific view on a human being is much poorer than that of ancient Greeks. In modern physics and biology, there is no place for feelings, thoughts, or the soul. Life is viewed as a continuous, irreversible interaction of biomolecules and emotions are associated with only our hormones produced in our body.\n\nRecently, however, a new form of research, quantum biology emerged, which studies the role that quantum mechanics plays in biological systems. It often uses the concept of quantum nonlocality to describe the human mind. However, quantum mechanics in its present form is ill-suited for description of the processes occurring in the living organism. Quantum mechanics uses the probabilistic approach to the description of quantum systems, while the processes in a biological organism, on the contrary, demonstrate a high degree of determinism. One of the fathers of quantum mechanics, E. Schrödinger, wrote ‘A single group of atoms existing only in one copy produces orderly events, marvelously tuned in with each other and with the environment according to most subtle laws… we are here obviously faced with events whose regular and lawful unfolding is guided by a ‘mechanism’ entirely different from the ‘probability mechanism’ of physics.” N. Sotina develops the deterministic (causal) interpretation.\n\nUsing this approach, she proved that some spatial structures, composed of elements of non-molecular nature, accompany any quantum object in the physical vacuum. It is natural to assume that the structures of living matter are more complex than those that are non-living.  These ideas are in agreement with the results of the experiment conducted by Romanian biochemist, Eugene Macovschi (1906-1985).  Macovschi and his group made the following observation: after being exposed to 200 ATMs hydrostatic pressure, the living plant tissues released a certain amount of water and still remained alive, after the tissue died it behaved in quite a different way: after being exposed to 200 ATMs a dead tissue released all the water it contained. According to Macovschi, living cells consist of two qualitatively different forms of matter: a special form of structured matter (he called “biostructure”) and coexisting molecular matter, the chemicals. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

It is the action of one mind on another at a distance and without communication by means of the senses. In Telepathy' by William Walker Atkinson (1910), the Society for Psychical Research conducted experiments on telepathy, thought-transference and similar phenomena. These experiments have been fully reported and these reports comprise several volumes, which give the world a valuable record of psychic phenomena to science.\n\nMethods: The pineal gland is the thought transmitter; it serves as a conduit for telepathic communication. It is a small cone-shaped gland at the back of our brain, located exactly at the top of the spinal cord, which in Hindu traditions is called the extra-sensory third ‘eye’ through which perception of the world is not limited to the physical senses. According to Lang et al. (2002), every emotion you feel, every moment of joy and fear, produces a chemical enzyme in your body. Each enzyme passes through the pineal. The pineal is the system of entry into the Divine Mind. Some thoughts and feelings become springboards; others become obstructions. Doubt is one blockage that prevents the manifestation of our desires. \n\nDoubt creates a biochemical reaction, which activates a neuron carrier in the brain that flows from the pituitary gland to the pineal and blocks the gateway to the Divine Mind.  This becomes the forgotten information. \nThe Cerebral Cortex is where thinking, logic, deduction, evaluation, short term memory etc. takes place. It also controls the function of the five physical senses and extremity movement. It gathers information for the various levels of consciousness. This area constantly interferes with telepathic communication and must be stilled in order to receive instruction through the higher mind (Jasmuheen, 1995). As a result, if we quiet the cerebral cortex the third eye gets activated, where the thoughtless form creates a pathway to enter into the ‘Divine Mind’ through the pineal. Thus, we can use telepathy to connect with the higher dimensions of consciousness. It is the next step in our evolution. \n\nDiscussion: Equate your brain to a mobile device. A mobile device can receive and send signals to another device, which is far away. Likewise, a human brain can receive and transmit information to another brain. We are not able to telepathically communicate. This is because there are two major blocks, which prevents the brain from ‘Telepathic Communication’. They are, \n\nBlock 1: We are not aware our brain has telepathic ability. Because we doubt, is it possible to transfer thoughts or telepathy exists? As we have seen ‘doubt’ is one blockage which prevents the manifestation of our desires. The same happens here, the doubt that telepathy is impossible creates a biochemical reaction and activates a neuron carrier in the brain that flows from the pituitary gland to pineal and blocks the gateway to the divine mind which becomes the forgotten information. \nBlock 2: Our brain is engaged in various thoughts and desires. Cerebral cortex is the womb where the birth of thought forms and desires are delivered. So, one must still the cerebral cortex to activate the third eye, where the thoughtless form clears the block in the pineal and creates a pathway to enter into the divine mind. To still the cerebral cortex, we can use meditation techniques and other motivational programs to activate the third eye unlocking the ‘telepathic ability.’\n\nDuring ancient times in India, people used telepathy for communicating. They say the pineal gland served as the medium of receiving and transmitting information. But, as time passed, people were slowly pulled into the whirlpool of scientific discoveries and technological development. The pineal gland has become dormant. For an individual to experience telepathic power, it takes time for a person to unlock the blocks to fully use his/her telepathic ability.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Several experimental studies evaluating psi-performance of different family members, as well as surveys and pedigree analyses suggest that this might be the case. However, the first molecular evidence supporting this idea appeared a few months ago. From a carefully selected sample of psychic individuals, DNA was obtained and compared with that of a control group (non-psychics). Though no significant differences were found in coding regions, a consistent single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found in one intron of the TNRC 18 gene (Wahbeh et al. 2021). This gene encodes a massive protein (around 10 times the size of the average protein) whose function and structure has not been properly elucidated yet. TNRC18 protein expresses in many organs and in different brain regions and has nine isoforms.\n\nThe aim of this work is to delve into the functional and structural aspects of the TNRC18 gene product and try to determine if it is likely for it to be somehow involved in psychic function. In addition, I investigate if there is a phylogenetic pattern regarding TNRC18 and evolutionary-related proteins (homologs)\n\nThe sequence of human TNRC18 protein was used as a query in the phmmer program (Saripella et al. 2016), which searches for similar proteins in completely sequenced genomes from the Uniprot database, which is one of the main databases in which properly curated complete genomes are stored. The cutoff value was 10e-05. Secondary structure was then predicted with GOR4 (Kouza et al. 2017) and Phyre2 (Kelley et al. 2015) programs. These employ different algorithms that analyze amino acid composition of proteins to try to infer the possible folding of the protein sequence. Phyre2 was also used to model possible protein domains found in the homologous search with phmmer. To provide additional support, the IUPred2A program (Mészáros et al. 2018) was used to predict disordered regions and further confirm the secondary and tertiary structure analyses. Global and local alignments using the Needle and WATER programs, respectively, from the EMBOSS suite (Rice et al. 2000) were performed to corroborate the presence and position of identified domains.\n\nThe TNRC18 protein is widely distributed along the vertebrate clade, but also in some arthropods and one flat worm. Additionally, homologs were found in other eukaryotes, mainly plants. Three functional domains for the TNRC18 protein were identified: bromo-adjacent homology (BAH), Tudor, and Hoxb9. Prediction of disordered regions confirmed the presence of those domains and revealed that most of the protein structure might lack a defined secondary structure (i.e., may be disordered).\n\nAll protein domains identified in TNRC18 are somehow involved in transcriptional regulation (Callebaut et al. 1999; Lu & Wang, 2013; Prévôt et al. 2000). This may suggest that the TNRC18 gene alone might not be the only one responsible for psi development, but that it may have a pivotal role as part of a transcriptional regulatory network. This kind of networks comprise different regulatory proteins and their interactions with target genes and have been found to be especially important Molecular Bases of Psychic Talent 2 SSE-PA Connections 2021: A combined meeting of the Society for Scientific Exploration and the Parapsychological Association in several brain-associated aspects, such as behavior (Sinha et al. 2020) and brain disorders (Pearl et al. 2019).\n\nAlthough Wahbeh et al. (2021) found only one polymorphism in an intronic sequence of the TNRC18 gene, this could have important implications in the expression of the gene product. Variation within intronic regions can result in the expression of different protein isoforms (Tress et al. 2007; Mucaki et al. 2020), even if such variation is due to a unique SNP (Ueffing et al. 2009; Jakubauskiene et al. 2012). If the TNRC18 gene is indeed associated with psi, it is likely that this is also the case in different organisms possessing this gene. Its presence in all main vertebrate clades supports the idea that psi may not be an exclusively human trait, but that it might be present at least in other animals (Dutton & Williams, 2009). Further phylogenetic analyses that include distantly related homologs could help to elucidate the evolutionary path of the TNRC18 gene. Combining this with more robust genetic studies that follow the line of Wahbeh et al. (2021) could also give us a wider picture of the molecular basis of psychic functioning.\n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The traditional approach to scholarly activities has emphasized the gathering of rigorous data and the development of theoretical models to explain those data.\nI take no issue with those traditional emphases, but suggest they be supplanted with parallel work investigating pragmatic applications. For too long researchers in anomalies have somewhat defensively, and perhaps naively, thought that with sufficient data critics might be persuaded to soften their criticism. This has, for the most part, not been a winning strategy.\nI suggest that acceptance of the reality of any particular phenomenon deemed anomalous might be due not simply to sufficiently persuasive data, but also the possibility that acceptance might also be due to either personal experience or practical application. Given the current explosion of knowledge expansion, everyone, scientist and layperson, must increasingly rely on those socially deemed to be experts and therefore worthy of our attention. The problem of acceptance of most anomalies, then, can largely be reduced to questions of “belief” and “conversion” to particular points of view.\n\nThe younger generation seems less interested in empirical squabbles or theoretical arguments, and more interested in personal experience and practical applications.

It is therefore most intuitive to think of premonitions (i.e., precognitive dreams and visions that seem to foreshadow a later death or disaster) as relating to some psychic radar ideally helping the individual avoid dangers or avert catastrophes imperiling others in their family or community. \n\nHowever, while accounts of threat-avoidance following on dream premonitions do exist (e.g., Dossey, 2009), seemingly far more prevalent in the literature (e.g., Krohn & Kripal, 2018) and in personal accounts collected by the author (Wargo, 2021) are premonitions that are not recognized as such until after disaster or tragedy strikes, as well as premonitions that are too imprecise or symbolic ever to be usable for threat avoidance. Indeed, the experience of guilt following a calamity that had seemingly been foreshadowed in a dream is such a common experience that it may even be the most important adverse mental-health consequence of precognition. \n\nI offer an alternative hypothesis about precognition in general and premonitions in particular—one that helps account for why, if precognition orients toward the individual’s survival, premonitory dreams so often focus on tragic outcomes that in reality cannot be avoided. Precognition does reflect an unconscious survival orientation, I argue, but its conscious manifestations, such as in dreams, are not radar-like warnings about future avoidable outcomes are instead conscious thoughts about the dreamer’s own survival, displaced backward in time from the aftermath of future traumatic brushes with death. Instead of psychic radar, premonitions may really be a preemptive part of a working-through process in processing future traumas. \n\nIn one respect, this argument harkens back to the insights of Victorian psychical researcher Frederick W. H. Myers, who theorized that dream premonitions reflect occult interpersonal connection, the reception of a telepathic signal from another person in crisis (Kripal, 2010). I argue that the signal is indeed one of crisis, but that the connection is intrapersonal, coming from the individual’s own future—a “psychic” (but really probably quantum-neurobiological) connection to the future traumatized and perhaps guilt-wracked self. \n\nThat precognition may reflect the individual’s own temporally displaced thoughts and emotions derives support from the large body of research on presentiment in parapsychology (Mossbridge et al., 2012), and evidence from a range of emerging research areas also lend it credence. Those areas include quantum computing (Rubino et al., 2017), quantum biology (McFadden & Al-Khalili, 2014), and the neuroscience of dreaming and memory formation (Llewellyn, 2013). Additional indirect support for the hypothesis that dream premonitions are anticipatory of traumatic experiences and guilt comes from the psychoanalytic theory of trauma (e.g. Freud, 1984a; Žižek, 1989), as well as from structural linguistics (Saussure, 1983), which insists upon the essentially contrastive nature of signification (cf. Freud, 1984b): The highly salient existential signal from one’s future surviving self, “I’m still alive,” can only be carried by information that somebody else, perhaps a loved one or friend or even an anonymous victim of a calamity in the news, was not so lucky. But such a signal comes at an emotional cost. \n\nThrough close examination of premonitory dream accounts and the circumstances surrounding them, including Samuel Clemens’ famous dream of his brother Henry’s death (Twain, 2010) among others, I will show that survivor’s guilt is a common theme in premonitions and a likely key to understanding these baffling phenomena. \n\n---\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

We used a trait-analysis approach to examine the relationship between psi performance and various demographic, personality, and target factors. The trait-analysis approach is not new to psi and has been used over the past four decades with varying results. Drawing from this work, we expected that psi performance would be revealed as a small effect and that gender, psi belief, and target richness or target interestingness would correlate with performance. We also expected that effects would sometimes be in the direction opposite of conscious intention. Traditionally called psi missing, we call such effects “expectation-opposing.” \n\nAs computational power and the availability of participants have increased with the advent of online experiments, so has our capacity to examine what factors might influence performance on different tasks. The performance we describe in this presentation was obtained from two psi-testing platforms, one an iOS smartphone app and the other a website. The smartphone app contained three “games,” which were designed to measure micro-psychokinesis, conscious precognition, and unconscious precognition. The website presented a fourth task designed to measure conscious precognition performance in the form of a precognitive remote viewing task. We used parametric null hypothesis significance tests, including multiple linear regression and t-tests, to compare performance on these tasks against chance and also to determine how the factors we examined were related to task performance. These factors were self-reported age, gender, psi belief, psi confidence, Big-5 personality type, and target interestingness. Where clear effects were found, we pre-registered confirmatory analyses for a portion of the data set that had not previously been examined. \n\nOverall, our hypotheses were confirmed, and we also discovered additional effects. In this talk, we will present new analyses not discussed in a previous (2019) talk. Analyses of data from 5,908 individual logins and 1,001,427 trials obtained between 2018 and 2020 revealed a rich complexity of performance patterns, indicating that psi performance was influenced by virtually all of the factors we explored. Specifically, our key findings were: 1) significant expectation-opposing effects, with a confirmatory pre-registered replication of an expectation-opposing effect on a micro-pk task, 2) significant relationships between performance and psi belief, 3) significant relationships between performance on three of the four tasks with gender, 4) apparent strategy differences between men and women, where men likely used a micro-pk-focused strategy for multiple tasks while women use different strategies that depend on the task, 5) significant relationship between timing and target interestingness with precognitive remote viewing performance, with a confirmatory pre-registered replication of the interestingness effect. \n\nWe will discuss these results and their interpretations, then describe our recommendations for future attempts to better understand performance on online forced-choice psi tasks, a recommendation strategy for which we created the acronym SEARCH: Small effects, Early and exploratory, Accrue data, Recognize diversity in approach, Characterize don’t impose, and Hone in on big results.\n\n----\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Moga","description":"The Chakra Connection: Bridging the Physical and Mental-Emotional Bodies\nMargaret M. Moga \nIndiana University School of Medicine, Terre Haute, IN, USA \n\nNew Age practices, such as energy healing and yoga, typically describe seven energy centers, called chakras, lined up from the base of the spine to the top of the head. The function of the chakras is purportedly to spin and draw in life force, prana, to keep the mental, emotional and physical parts of the body healthy and in balance. Each chakra is associated with a particular color, nerve plexus, endocrine gland, and psychological quality/issue. Although widely accepted, there has been little scientific study of the Western chakra system. \n\nIn the present study, I examine exceptional, non-ordinary experiences of the chakras reported by healers, meditators, and yoga students in an anonymous online survey. The survey was advertised in social media, New Age publications, and among special interest groups. In the Chakra Experiences Survey, participants are encouraged to share any images, colors, sounds, and/or physical sensations related to the chakras in their respective practice which they have experienced directly or with a client. \n\nResults are preliminary and the study ongoing. Thus far, participants have reported physical sensations of warmth, pulsations, pressure and/or a circular sensation related to a particular chakra or chakras. Some individuals reported seeing the chakras through the mind’s eye or visibly as a swirling mist. According to self-identified healers, colors vary depending on the health and status of the individual. In addition to the rainbow colors widely published, golden light was associated with the heart and crown chakras, and white light, with the third eye chakra. One healer noted that “when we open or unblock the chakras, we may get flashes, images, perceptions, from what is stored in the chakras, based on past experiences or thoughts.” The images reported by participants showed consistency with psychological descriptions of the chakras. Multiple chakra activations were associated with kundalini experiences. \n\nBased on user experiences, chakras are both perceptible and subtle, resembling an intermediate state between physical reality and the mental-emotional realms. Historical and recent literature on the chakras suggest that chakra activations may be an important part of human development. \n\nReferences\n\nBruyere, R. (1994).

Typically, the procedure involves a Sender and a Receiver who are physically separated while the former attempts to relay target information to the latter. Refinements to this paradigm have included placing the Receiver in sensory isolation in an effort to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal, as seen in Ganzfeld research. \n\nIn his paper, published in the Winter Issue of the Journal of Scientific Exploration,  David Vernon addressed the feasibility of using a virtual reality (VR) environment to fully immerse the Sender in their experience in an effort to boost the transmission of the target. He will also outline a number of methodological refinements that could help to improve the viability and effectiveness of using VR in psi research.\n\nDr David Vernon is a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Canterbury Christ Church University. He is a fellow of the Higher Education Academy (UK), the Bial Foundation and a member of the Parapsychological Association and the Society for Psychical Research.

Recently, Rebek and Alcock (2019) cited Hume’s argument to dismiss the psi literature recently summarized by Cardena (2018) as impossible.  I wish to present a number of problems with the way psi critics have used Hume’s argument.  First, Hume’s primary target is the fallibility of testimony in the context of religious miracles.  Hume discusses at length the problems with testimony on religious matters, but provides little discussion on matters explored under much more controlled conditions, which happens to be the case with psi.  Psi skeptics do little to acknowledge this distinction.  Second, psi critics compare the psi data with various conventional theories which were developed from a different set of data.  To use Hume’s argument successfully, psi critics must avoid making an apples to oranges comparison.  The third problem is that psi critics do not fully consider that the anomalous data represents not something miraculous but instead some sort of phenomenon we presently understand poorly.  That is, the psi data may fall into the gaps in our current understanding of the world.  Given these 3 problems that the skeptics have failed to deal with, I argue that Hume, should he be alive today, might very likely accept the psi data.\n\nLive participation in SSE Community Discussion Hours is a benefit of membership in the Society for Scientific Exploration.

With the second method, no direct proof of the validity of the ABT can be obtained from the results.

This includes problems of the determination of the random expectation in ABT studies as well as the limits of validity of astrological factors in the practice of horoscope interpretation and matching experiments.

Group intention experiments often require the passage of time to determine a result, which is often clouded by ambiguity due to the presence of alternative causes for the desired effect. In remote viewing experiments, it can be difficult to differentiate between true perception-at-a-distance and pre-cognitive ESP (perceiving what your own eyes will be looking at in the future when receiving tar- get feedback). With controlled macro-PK, these difficulties are absent, or greatly reduced. Subjects can start and stop their efforts at will, with the target responding accordingly, limited by each subject's threshold for exhaustion or boredom. Recording the target’s response is easy, yet it is the measurement of the subjects and their environment which offers us great opportunities for exploration. EEG, skin conductance and other readings can easily be taken during PK. Random event generators can be placed near the subjects and targets to measure changes in ordinarily random processes. Biophoton and other bioenergetic readings can be taken, which scientists like Dr. Beverly Rubik already know a great deal about. While it may be difficult to find talented healers, seers, and energy workers, PK is an easily trainable skill which is quickly spreading throughout the world. Researchers can easily become their own subject while testing a new experimental design.\n\nBio: Sean McNamara teaches meditation and consciousness development in Denver, Colorado. He is the author of Meditation X: Telekinesis and Defy Your Limits: The Telekinesis Training Method. In 2014, Sean McNamara watched an online video of Cherylee Black giving a presentation to the International Association of Near-Death Studies in which she showed a personal example of macro-PK. Inspired, he trained himself in PK, and then devised an efficient protocol for teaching it to people in under two hours. In that time, a person can move their target from a distance in a way that is immediately observable and repeatable. Through his books and videos, people everywhere are learning McNamara’s PK protocols. He hopes this will support greater collaboration between scientists and practitioners.

Three viewers made weekly predictions on Sunday about an image they would be shown on Friday. Two images were selected to represent different states of a stock, and a judge reviewed the images and the viewers’ information. Based on the viewers’ impressions and a judge’s decision, an investor submitted funds predicting that the stock would rise or fall in value during the week. The investment results were affected by complications in the investing platform, and be- cause of this, the investment lost just under 7.5%. Without the complications, the investment would have made about 2.5% profit over 12 weeks. More importantly, this study examined the importance of the judge and investment selection in the ARV process. A second judge and investment instrument were included, blinded to all study participants. The second judge (J2) performed at a significantly less accurate level from the first judge (p&ltr;0.05), and J2 also performed significantly lower than could be expected by chance (p=0.02; effect size=-1.498; power&gtr;.80). Both judges performed significantly differently on the target in- vestment than on a control investment. Although this is a pilot study with a small sample size and a limited number of sessions, conclusions are that the selection of a judge, even a very experienced judge, can have a significant effect on the success of an ARV project and that judges’ decisions are more affected by the target investments than by a comparable control investment. Future ARV projects are advised to qualify judges for accuracy just as they qualify viewers for accuracy.\n\nBio: John G.

The recording was produced inside a Faraday cage using 38 sensors of various sensitivities that were intended to capture healing signals produced by three practitioners of the Bengston method of healing.\n\nData analysis focused on genes involved in cancer pathways or in cancer inflammation. Conclusions from the in-vitro work include: 1) healing intention can be captured and released, thereby potentially allowing the phenomenon to be more scalable in its dissemination; 2) reproducible biologic changes can be induced by healing intention, whether by direct hands-on healing or using a recording of healing activity; 3) hands-on delivery of healing intention may be stronger than a recording of that intention. As of this writing, in-vivo experiments involving exposure of mice to the recording have just begun. The results of these experiments are due at the end of April, and will be reported on at the conference.\n\nBio: Bill Bengston is the SSE President.

The selection problem is introduced here as a unique extension of the hard problem: while the hard problem asks “How does a physical system becomes conscious?”, the selection problem asks “Once conscious, how does the conscious physical system become a particular self?”. It is argued that these problems appear to be connected to the phenomenon of true randomness, and further exploration into the nature of mental interaction with random events will help elucidate a full theory of consciousness. In many mind-matter interaction experiments, random number generators that take advantage of quantum uncertainty have been used, but we note that turbulence in fluids is a non-linear process that may also be truly random in nature. The non-linearity implies that small effects of mental interaction with turbulence may be amplified to magnitudes that make the phenomenon more visible. Preliminary results from two experiments will be presented here. In one experiment, participants (in an online interface) attempted to influence turbulent wind fluctuations measured by a sonic anemometer in Davis, CA. In another experiment, a random event generator (TrueRNG) is placed on an aircraft operated by Scientific Aviation, Inc. The TrueRNG output was significantly more ordered when flying through regions of convective turbulence (z=3.67, p=0.0002, two-tailed). These findings hint at the possibility of a deep connection between quantum randomness, turbulence, and consciousness.\n\nBio: Dani Caputi is a doctoral candidate in Atmospheric Science at the University of California, Davis. Her research focuses on ozone pollution and nocturnal mixing dynamics in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, she has initiated several mind-matter interaction experiments that explore the possibility of mentally influencing the weather, and has introduced the selection problem of consciousness to the literature. As part of her program, she is a certified flight scientist for Scientific Aviation Inc.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada 2018.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Many of the well-studied objects today, such as quasars or pulsars, were considered anomalies at first sight – until we understood them. The ”Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations” (VASCO) project focuses on searching for anomalous events that took place on the sky in the last 70 years, by comparing the sky as it looked in the 1950s to the sky as it looks today. The hope is to find a physically ”impossible” object or event, for example a vanishing star, as this could be indicative of the large-scale engineering of an extra-terrestrial civilization. The VASCO project uses traditional automated methods in combination with citizen science (http://ml-blink.org) to search for these anomalous objects.\n\nIn this SSE Community Discussion Hour, Dr. Beatriz Villarroel presented the VASCO project and introduced the mysterious case of the ”nine simultaneous transients” (Villarroel et al. 2021), which shows how nine objects appeared and disappeared within half an hour in a small region on a red-sensitive photographic plate on the 12th of April 1950. She discusses various possibilities for this finding that cannot be explained with any well-known astrophysical phenomena. Dr. Villarroel first discusses the possibility of plate contamination (from e.g. nuclear fallout), but later opens up a possible interpretation of the nine transients in terms of solar reflections from metal debris in orbits around Earth – seven years before the first human satellite was launched. \n\nLive participation in SSE Community Discussion Hours is a benefit of membership in the Society for Scientific Exploration.

While some authors argue that conscious observation is a necessary element to achieve the transition from quantum to classical states during measurement, some go even further and propose a more active influence of the human mind on the probabilities of quantum measurement outcomes. This proposition was tested in micro-Psychokinesis (micro-Pk) research in which intentional observer effects on quantum random number generators (RNGs) were investigated. In the studies presented here we extended this line of research and tested the impact of unconscious goals on micro-Pk. Our focus was cigarette addiction as an unconscious drive and we hypothesized that regular cigarette smokers would influence the outcome of a quantum RNG that determined whether the participant was going to see a smoking-related or a neutral picture. While a first study showed strong evidence for a micro-Pk effect, a replication attempt failed to reproduce the results. When the data from both studies are combined a remarkable change in effect across time (resembling a combination of appearance followed by decline) can be seen only in the smoker’s subsample. Appearance-and-decline effects were absent in the non-smokers sample and in a simulation. Based on von Lucadou’s Model of Pragmatic Information we suggest that (micro-)Pk effects follow a systematic pattern comparable to a dampened harmonic oscillation. Although micro-Pk effects seem to elude a classical proof, an analysis and prediction of their temporal change might proof to be a promising workaround.\n\nBio: Moritz Dechamps studied Psychology in Munich, Germany. He wrote his Master’s thesis about Retrocausal influence on psychological effects and engaged in research on quantum mind models in the process. Excited by this fascinating topic he decided to further explore the connection between mind and matter while doing a PhD at the LMU Munich. During these last 3 years he focused mainly on micro-psychokinetic research and conducted experiments on the influence of psychologically motivated observers on quantum random number generators.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada 2018.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Modern mediumship research has included accuracy testing of the information reported by mediums under blinded laboratory conditions with statistically significant results. It has been posited that mediums are using clairvoyance, precognition, or telepathy with the living to acquire accurate information about the deceased. A recent study examined mediums’ experiences during mediumship readings for the deceased and during psychic readings for/about the living. Participant responses from 113 self-identified mediums and 14 Windbridge Certified Research Mediums were quantitatively analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis software and qualitatively analyzed using a content analysis methodology. Statistically significant differences were seen for LIWC categories including social and perceptual processes and insight. Qualitative content analysis found that mediumistic experiences include a triangulation of the communication and that psychic experiences include the information flowing from various sources including from the deceased. \n\nFurther analysis demonstrated that the level of development of the self-identified mediums was significantly less than that of the Windbridge mediums (z=4.931, p&alt;0.01) and indicates that blocking unwanted communication from the deceased is a learned skill. Together, these findings strongly call into question the continued use of terminology separating mediums’ experiences into categories that do and do not involve communication with the deceased. Going forward, it will be necessary for language to reflect empirical data and the experiences of modern mediums rather than philosophical conjecture.\n\nBio: Julie Beischel, PhD, has been performing empirical research with mediums full-time for 15 years. She has examined the accuracy and specificity of the information mediums report; their psychology, physiology, and phenomenology; and the potential social applications of mediumship readings.

Concurrently announced was the creation of a new organization called To The Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences (TTSAAS). Headed by a rock star, Tom DeLonge, it boasted a stellar cast of former U.S. government intelligence executives and scientists, all of whom had an interest in UFOs.\n\nLong before Senator Harry Reid was able to earmark funding for the DIA project, I ran a similar effort for several years in the 1980s. Participants all had Top Secret/SCI level clearances. They came from all DOD Services, the Intelligence Community, and civilian aerospace companies. Despite the funds available for the more recent DIA program, it appears that the fundamental findings were the same. Key is the fact that although no- body is in charge or has institutional responsibility for this area, credible, multisensory events were documented displaying physical characteristics and capabilities that defy all known human technology. While the recent DIA study did add to the body of knowledge, their lack of transparency has fostered considerable angst amongst the UFO community. The technical and organizational observations during the prior study will be compared with those revealed though the efforts of TTSAAS.\n\nThis presentation also addresses other aspects of the study of UFOs. Specifically, what is the appropriate role of the U. S. Government in studying this topic? As global phenomena, sightings by U.S. Government agencies represent a tiny, but significant, portion of recorded events. What DoD does have are a variety of advanced sensors, some of which they choose to keep as classified. The UFO community has little understanding of how these complex institutions function, while the issue of unnecessary secrecy further invigorates their confabulations.\n\nCovered will be the critical factors facing senior government officials with fiduciary responsibilities in funding any project with little probability of demonstrable return on investment. This includes the zero-sum game that befalls all programs, including those in the black world, the use of contractors to hide reports from FOIA requests, and the impact of personal belief systems on these studies.\nAs funding is signal issue, a comparative analysis will be made between money and resources available for studies of UFOs and related phenomena and those afforded more conventional, intrinsically complex problems such as AIDS, cancer, or the fundamental physics search for elusive God Particle.\n\nBio: John B.

The National Science Foundation uses belief in astrology as an example pseudoscience. In a recent survey, SSE members ranked their acceptance of astrology last among 10 anomalous phenomena. Throughout recorded history, attitudes towards astrology have ebbed and flowed. From widespread acceptance and providing the foundations of modern science – Newton and Kepler practiced astrology – to condemnation as heresy by Popes and pseudoscience by modern day skeptics, astrology has often been at the center of cultural and intellectual clashes over prevailing worldviews. Is there scientific evidence for astrology?\n\nAstrology is the prototypical anomaly: outside of the scope of current scientific theories, persistently accepted by a significant number of people, methodologically challenging to study, with some enticing and elusive results. I will briefly review the history of astrology, provide an introduction\nto horoscopic representations and interpretations, and outline the methodological and statistical challenges that must be addressed to conduct research on astrology. We will examine some examples of research that confounds both astrologers and skeptics and discuss the lessons for research across a range of anomalistic phenomena.\n\nBio: Dr. Urban-Lurain is an Associate Professor and Associate Director for Engineering Education Research in the CREATE for STEM Institute at Michigan State University.

Interventions such as mind-body practices would be expected to improve the biofield, whereas stressors would be expected to weaken it. In addition, practitioners of yoga, meditation, and qigong who engage in extraordinary states may be able to manipulate the biofield.\n\nThe ultraweak light emitted from organisms (biophotons) is recognized as one component of the biofield. We designed and built a custom photon counting detector system using a photomultiplier tube inside a dark closet. Our experiments show that various regions of the human body, including the hand, forehead, and heart regions, emit photons in the visible spectrum at an extremely low rate (less than 100 counts per min per cm 2 ), in line with published values. We measured the light emitted from practitioners of qigong, meditation, yoga, and various types of energy healing, including Reiki and external qi. In some cases, these practitioners were able to alter their own energy emission dramatically, for example by “opening” and “closing” the “third eye” region, or turning “on” and “off” the sending of healing energy. Moreover, each energy healing session with practitioner and patient was unique in the temporal pattern of biophoton emission measured.\n\nIn other experiments using the Bio-Well, a commercial device for biofield assessment by electrophotonic imaging of the fingertips, one can observe and calculate changes in the induced light emission pre-post intervention or provocation.

In the first experiment, using a technique developed by Sean McNamara, I trained myself to produce telekinetic movement (i.e., macro PK) of a foil object balanced on a needle within a glass enclosure. I also concurrently collected data from a TrueRNG random number generator (RNG). These data were analyzed for significant deviations from randomness (i.e., micro PK) following statistical procedures established by the PEAR Lab and Global Consciousness Project. After reaching a point where I could consistently and reliably produce movement in the object via intention, several more sessions were conducted with greater methodological constraints in place. During these tests, HD webcam video of the object’s motion was recorded and temporally synchronized with the RNG’s data stream. Prior to each test, baseline video and RNG data was collected in which no intention was applied to the object. Moreover, several hundred hours worth of simulated data were collected from the RNG to ensure the device operated as expected under normal conditions (randomly).\n\nIn the second experiment, I used Psyleron’s SyncTXT synchronicity application as a trigger for investing in cryptocurrencies on the Coinbase exchange. I enacted purchases and sales based on custom messages received from the SyncTXT app at random intervals. Trends from\ndaily closing price indexes following the SyncTXT messages were used to assess investment performance.

Starting in the 1950s, writer John Campbell claimed that the device functioned using the operator’s psi and could still produce an output even if the electronics were replaced by a schematic of the internal circuit. This non-electronic device is known as a Symbolic Hieronymus Machine (SHM). In the current exploratory study, a SHM was used to predict voting results in six “Battle Ground” states (states whose voting outcomes could not be predicted using traditional means) during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. A randomized, blinded protocol was used to establish two baseline EE Rates: one for historically “Blue” and another for historically “Red” voting states. Next, using the same protocol, EE Rates were established for each of the six target states while the operator asked to be shown the state’s future election out come. The resulting EE Rates were mapped to the Blue and Red baseline rates to create outcome predictions for each target. This method accurately predicted the outcomes in five of the six states. In comparison, only two states were accurately predicted using the same protocol with a truly random source substituted for the SHM. While still exploratory, this project demonstrates a potential methodology to evaluate event prediction using the SHM and similar devices.\n\nBio: Mark Boccuzzi is a co-founder and researcher at the Windbridge Institute, LLC, and the executive director of the Windbridge Research Center, an Arizona nonprofit dedicated to performing rigorous scientific research and creating educational materials focused on dying, death, and what comes next.

This includes both studies demonstrating psi (telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind-matter interactions) and empirical evidence suggestive of the survival of consciousness after bodily and brain death (or simply: survival). The most evidential survival data come from reports of children with verifiable past life memories, veridical information acquired during near-death experiences involving brain death, and accurate and specific information about the deceased reported by psychic mediums under controlled laboratory conditions. In addition, non-psi-based research in the area of body ownership (the experience that this body is mine) using rubber hand and body swap illusions confirms a tenuous and easily disrupted tether between consciousness and the body throughout physical life. Furthermore, the variable turnover rates of tissues in the living body established using protocols such as the carbon-14 bomb-pulse method demonstrate a discontinuous body and thus an impermanence of the living physical self. These realities are further echoed in the common language used to describe the difference between the body and the self.

Questions surrounding it are legion and it now appears ripe for scientific revolution and redefinition.  Perhaps its most vexing feature is that, whereas the central equations of physics are time-symmetric (that is, they admit both time-forward and time-reversed solutions), our everyday experience is time-asymmetric, unidirectionally toward the future [1-3].\n\nThe various forms of precognition (e.g., presentiment, premonition) stand as counter-examples to this temporal unidirectionality.  Although there is no consensus scientific explanation for it, precognition likely does not involve new physics; rather it requires that currently accepted physics be interpreted in a more forthright manner.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce the rudiments of time's symmetry and asymmetry, then propose an explanation for precognition in terms of currently-accepted physics. New research directions will be suggested, including non-biologic systems that might demonstrate this phenomenon.

In 1981 Rupert Sheldrake proposed an interesting model of development in which collective memories are stored in a “morphic field” that progeny tap into to regulate their development along the lines of their predecessors. The concept was quickly rejected because of weak arguments. Morphic resonance has the potential to enable clinical regeneration of limbs and organs. I will suggest that the morphic field resides in a quantum information field which is capable of being engineered.\n\nHomeopathy provides another example. Remedies are diluted again and again until there is virtually nothing left of the original substance. During this “potentizing” process, the therapeutic effectiveness increases rather than decreases. This of course makes absolutely no logical sense and provides skeptics ammunition for dismissing one of the world’s most popular and successful therapeutic modalities. However, what if the repeated dilutions, with agitation, (referred to as “succussion” in homeopathy) are systematically transferring vibrational information from the therapeutic molecules into a pervasive quantum information field? \n\nBio: Jim Oschman, Ph.D., is an internationally recognized expert on the biophysics of Energy and Informational Medicine.

But even its most steadfast proponents acknowledge that materialism cannot account for the fact of consciousness and that it involves extremely unpalatable consequences for our sense of autonomy and moral responsibility.  Moreover, close analysis shows that the cognitive dissonance inherent in materialism makes it virtually untenable as a coherent theory of mind.  How then should we account for its resilience as the default mainstream theory in contemporary neuroscience, cognitive psychology and the philosophy of mind?  \n\nThis resilience stems from the seeming plausibility of two central dogmas. First, that impairment to critical brain regions causes a degradation of corresponding cognitive function and that this proves that mind is dependent on the brain. Second, the physical domain is presumed to be causally closed, which is taken to imply that mind is either reducible to the brain or else epiphenomenal and irrelevant.  In this paper, I propose to show that neither of these dogmas stands up to critical scrutiny, and that the result of this scrutiny can help delineate the outlines of a transmission model of the mind/brain interaction, in terms of quantum field theory. \n\nIn my concluding section, I discuss the consciousness-based paradigm as the proper framework for resolving the mind-body problem. This paradigm is preferable to neutral monism for a variety of reasons. Moreover, it provides a theoretical background for understanding mental causation, spatiotemporal anomalies uncovered by advanced physics, and for a variety of psi phenomena and instances of synchronicity.  \n\nBio: David Scharf is a professor of physics, and chair of the physics department, at Maharishi University of Management.

Failures in both worldviews suggests an alternative basis.\n\nIt is fashionable today to believe that consciousness collapses the quantum wavefunction and thus creates reality. But as developed in this paper, this idea is grounded in a faulty assumption. This paper examines the early history of quantum theories and in so doing reveals the flawed assumptions involved. Having isolated the issue in the mathematics of the Copenhagen interpretation, a new model is offered in line with the Bohmian interpretation.  Further considerations are offered with respect to causation. A new model of reality is offered that is grounded in information which produces the universe and its contents, including subjective consciousness.\n\nIt is shown briefly that this new model begins to solve Chalmer’s “Hard Problem of Consciousness” by building the bridge called for by Chalmers in his original statement of the Hard Problem.\n\nFundamental features of the observed universe inform the new model; it is possible to develop a description of a Non-Material aspect that correlates well with the Bohmian and Transactional interpretations of quantum physics.\n\nThe resulting model proposed is claimed to explain all observations, measurements, experiments and experiences. In doing so, it is possible to understand how a deep reality produces all events and contents of the universe and thereby explains all phenomena, including phenomena identified with nonlocal consciousness.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Streiff grew up with a front row seat to the 20th century technology revolution. Raised as an objective, rational, critical thinker with an interest in science and technology, he became fascinated with the psychology of deception and belief at a young age. His skepticism was challenged in the mid 1970s when he conducted successful controlled psi experiments including a highly successful real-time remote viewing simulation of an intelligence task involving both remote perception and influence. \n\nAfter graduating from San Diego State University, John served in a variety of technology positions in global corporations. Throughout the period, parapsychology research remained a focus of interest. During this time it became clear that understanding the meaning of psi required discovering the true nature of Reality. He has spent the last four decades answering that fundamental question.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Broomfield, Colorado 2019.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

In particular, is psi explained by quantum mechanics? Consilience of quantum concepts with those in various disciplines can have value, and careful invocations of quantum in psi research have used quantum as an analogy. Often, though, it has crept in as more than that.\n\nThe quantum observer effect has been used to explain psychokinesis. We act as if the Von Neumann-Wigner quantum observer interpretation that consciousness is required for wave function collapse is accepted quantum mechanics. It is not. Innovative work such as Cramer’s transactional interpretation explicitly excludes the need for a conscious observer, and instead invokes advanced (retrograde) waves. We don’t need a conscious observer effect for quantum mechanics (but we might need retrocausation).\n\nBeautiful experiments that make use of participants focusing their attention on a double-slit apparatus to reduce fringe visibility might be interpreted to show that consciousness collapses the wavefunction. Do they indeed show that? No, they simply show that participants focusing their attention on a double-slit apparatus can reduce the fringe visibility. The influence can work on any randomness/noise in the system.\n\nSimilarly, quantum entanglement cannot explain telepathy. Quantum entanglement provides correlation but not information. When a mother wakes up in the middle of the night and cries, “oh no, my son has been hurt,” because she senses that her distant son has just gotten into an accident, information was obtained. That is not just correlation.\n\nWe don't even need quantum mechanics for some quantum concepts. Uncertainty is a principle of wave-like systems – no need here for quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics doesn’t explain quantum healing, or quantum consciousness, or even quantum mechanics itself.\n\nWhat we know is that intention can influence a system having randomness, whether quantum or otherwise. Psi understanding will advance more effectively with well-defined models that are verifiable rather than with grand speculative theories.\n\nBio: Garret Moddel is a professor of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado.

Nelson | Are Evoked Potentials a Model for GCP Event Data?","description":"Signal averaging can reveal patterns in noisy data from repeated-measures experimental designs. A widely known example is brain activity in response to either endogenous or exogenous stimuli such as decisions, visual patterns, or auditory bursts of sound. A commonly used technology is EEG or other monitoring of brain electrical potentials. Evoked potentials (EP) are measured in time-locked synchronization with repetitions of a stimulus. The electrical measure in raw form is extremely noisy, reflecting not only responses to the imposed stimulus but also a large amount of normal, but unrelated activity. In the raw data no structure related to the stimulus is apparent, so the measurement process is repeated many times, yielding multiple epochs that can be averaged. Such “signal averaging” reduces or washes out random fluctuations while structured variation linked to the stimulus builds up over multiple samples. A typical pattern may show a large excursion preceded and followed by smaller deviations with a typical time-course relative to the stimulus. \n\nThe Global Consciousness Project (GCP) network generates trials once per second at about 60 locations around the world, sending synchronized sequences of data to a central archive. Our standard analysis computes a network variance measure for each second across the parallel data streams. From this a Z-score figure of merit is calculated for each formal test of the GCP hypothesis: We predict non-random structure in data taken during “global events” that engage the attention of large numbers of people. The data are typically displayed as a cumulative deviation trace, but for the present work, we treat the raw data in the same way measured electrical potentials from the brain are processed. Signal averaging is used to reveal temporal patterns or structure in what otherwise appears to be random data.\n\nApplying this model to analyze GCP data from events that show significant departures from expectation, we find patterns that look like those found in EP work. While this assessment is limited to exploratory visual comparisons, the degree of similarity is striking. It suggests that human brain activity in response to stimuli may be a useful model to guide research designed to observe responses of a global consciousness to events in the world.\n\nBio: Roger Nelson, PhD, is an experimental psychologist and conceptual artist.

The first method discussed will be the Psi3 (was “PsiQ”) app for the iPhone, which provides three games testing for conscious precognition, implicit precognition, and micro-psychokinesis. The second method discussed will be the training website for the book The Premonition Code, which tests precognitive remote viewing with a single photo target. Third will be a combined lab-and-online approach testing the results of in-lab hypnotic suggestions of improved precognitive ability and experiences of unconditional love on performance on conscious precognition (using Psi3), micro-psychokinesis (using Psi3) and precognitive remote viewing (using “TargetMonkey” targets at remoteviewed.com).

By using these protocols, evidence for psi continues to emerge. However, not every research participant who takes part in these standardized psi tests shows an effect. The consilience of research into differences in individual standardized non-psi test results, biological responses to medications and foods, cognitive and decision-making styles, personality types, chronotypes, and intrinsic and explicit beliefs demonstrates that one-size-fits-all options are rarely useful for humans. And while parapsychologists have made significant advances in understanding the factors that can impact laboratory psi experiments including target optimization, experimenter effects, participant selection, and experimental environment, the common practice continues to involve giving the same tests to all participants regardless of their individual differences. I propose that task optimization, that is, the customization of psi tasks based on the cognitive styles and other factors of the participant, may be an additional relevant factor impacting the results of laboratory psi experiments. A series of studies has been designed examining this issue by developing customized testing activities (games) that meet the needs of participants’ specific fundamental cognitive styles. Psi researchers may be leaving data and evidence on the table by not employing task optimization and this highly targeted approach may capture psi functioning in populations that do not typically perform well on standardized psi tests.\n\nBio: Mark Boccuzzi has spent much of his career at the intersection of science, technology, education, and interactive visual arts.

The organizational fields of plant, animal, human behavior, cultural systems, and mental activity, all can be regarded as morphic fields containing an inherent memory.” (Rupert Sheldrake) \n\nThe Yi Jing is a cosmological and philosophical system, created in China more than three thousand years ago. The Yi Jing is used to improve the decision-making processes by integrating arational dimensions, which may be assimilated to a kind of precognition into evaluating various options. \n\nSynchronicity, as a principle, stipulates that two events may be linked together not only by a causal chain but also because they create meaning. \n\nThe hypothesis to be tested is this: If several people are working on an issue of collective interest with the Yi Jing (i.e. a reflection that affects each of us on a super personal level) or has an archetypal dimension, do the obtained hexagrams reflect that collective concern? This would be considered an “impression” or “footprint” of morphic fields. It would also indicate some “out-of-body” extension of consciousness. \n\n“Producing” a hexagram may be considered a “triggered” synchronicity, because the Yi Jing consultant relates an inner psychic state with something in the physical world (the hexagram) using a non-causal process (coins or yarrow stalks method). Do individual drawings of the hexagrams indicate a significant deviation from what the laws of statistics provide for? This could also be interpreted as a “collective synchronicity”, because different persons create several individual synchronicity events each time a person draws a hexagram using a non-causal process. These events converge together into a set of privileged hexagrams. In fact, this deviation from the statistically expected distributions of the hexagrams is illustrated with a variety of experiments. \n\nBio: Dr. Gabriel Felley is a professor of Business Information Technology at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (www.fhnw.ch). He studied Theoretical Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. For decades, he has been dealing with the Yi Jing (I Ching) to rehabilitate it as a sophisticated, holistic methodology to understand the logic underlying the processes of change in a generic way and to promote it as a tool for the support of managerial decision-making processes. He has written numerous articles and lectured on topics related to Yi Jing in Switzerland as well as in Germany, China, Vietnam and the USA. \n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Broomfield, Colorado 2019.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

How these so-called psi phenomena affect individuals during childhood and later in their adult lives? \n\nDespite the considerable research that exists about human non-ordinary abilities, little attention has been given to the understanding of psi phenomena when experienced during childhood. On the other hand, competing views on children’s non-ordinary experiences often confuse and worry parents, receiving diagnosis ranging from mental disorders to theories of “advanced beings”. Motivated by her personal experiences during childhood, and subsequent interest in the study of consciousness from a non-reductionist and multi-dimensional perspective, the author has promoted over the years a specific investigation on this subject, aimed at examining a population as diverse as possible to allow room for different descriptions and interpretations of the phenomena. In a first exploratory phase, in-depth interviews were conducted with children and adults from thirteen countries, belonging to different religions and cultural backgrounds, who claimed to have had non-ordinary experiences during the period of their childhood up to 14 years old. The professions of the adults interviewed included, among others: four medical doctors, five engineers, five musicians, and nine administrators and economists, of whom two were PhDs occupying high profile positions in a government department of their country. Using mixed methods methodology during this first phase of the study, a number of interesting phenomena were examined, including: night terrors, visions, auditory perceptions, isolated sleep paralysis, invisible friends, out-of-body experiences, premonitions, and uncontrollable fears. This led the author to subsequently design appropriate psychometric scales to quantify fear and several of the subjective phenomena examined. In this work, the obtained data will be discussed and illustrated by describing some extremely significant real cases. The author’s ultimate motivation with her analysis is to help parents and professionals distinguishing the signs of a sensitive child having non-ordinary perceptions, from those of other possible conditions or disorders.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Broomfield, Colorado 2019.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

This analysis used experiences (N = 236) that could be classified as mystical by James’ (1902) definition (e.g., transiency, ineffability, passivity, noetic quality), or involved a dramatic change in the person’s sense of self, time, or space (e.g., Stace, 1960; Yaden et al., 2017). They were retrieved from several websites that solicit and post visitors’ descriptions of their transcendent experiences.\n\nExperience descriptions were content analyzed using a 65-item rating scale designed to capture salient aspects, including psi experiences and encounters with a variety of entities (e.g., “Did the person encounter someone they knew who was dead?”). Descriptions were rated on each of the 65 items using a 5-point Likert scale (“definitely absent” to “definitely present”) indicating whether the item appeared to be an element of the experience. Each description was rated at least twice, and inter-rater reliability for each pair of ratings was acceptable. \n\nThe experiences occurred during dreams, hypnogogic/hypnopompic states, hypnosis, out of body experiences, near death experiences, physical crises, prayer/meditation, psychotic episodes, and ordinary waking states. Demographic information on experiencers is limited, but the cases came from 16 countries, with 38.7% male and 61.3% female experiencers. The average age at the time of the experience was 28.2 years (SD = 15.08). Thirty percent of the experiences included the presence of psi experiences and/or entity encounters. Approximately 14% of self-transcendent experiencers reported telepathy, clairvoyance, or precognition with no reported incidents of psychokinesis; 19.1% of experiencers described encountering entities, including apparitions, angels, other spiritual beings, dead relatives, and miscellaneous beings; and 3% experienced both psi phenomena and entity encounters. A detailed breakdown of frequencies will be presented along with qualitative data.\n\nResults suggest psi experiences and entity encounters are elements of a substantial minority of self-transcendent experiences. These results are consistent with Thalbourne’s (2006) filter theory, which suggests thin boundaries may act as a common denominator among a variety of altered states. They also conform to Marshall’s (2011) suggestion that psi phenomena and mystical states need to be explained together, not separately. Limitations and suggestions for further research will be discussed.\n\nBIO: Jennifer Lyke, Ph.D. is a Professor of Psychology at Stockton University.

Consequently, the study of precognitive dreams and other precognitive behaviors should not ignore highly personal meanings and associations that may be relatively inaccessible to strict laboratory methods. Clinical case studies of Sigmund Freud as well as others working in his tradition provide a rich trove of data on precognition, which has been largely overlooked both by psychoanalysts and, with a few exceptions, by parapsychologists. Indeed, reexamination of events in Freud’s biography shows that he himself precognized significant upheavals in his later life in his dreams and parapraxes, even though he never acknowledged such a possibility.\n\nThe psychoanalytic construct of the unconscious offered turn-of-the-century science a way to admit otherwise supernormal-seeming human capabilities into scientific consideration, by framing them as the operation of a not-causally-outrageous (but still-paradoxical) off-stage agency forming judgments and directing our behavior without our direct awareness. Yet in light of more recent research, ranging from laboratory precognition and presentiment evidence to new thinking about retrocausation in physics, it becomes more parsimonious to reframe many phenomena associated with the unconscious (dreams, parapraxes, creativity, and even neurotic symptomatology) as potentially precognitive in nature. Parapsychology more generally could gain much from a “return to Freud,” since his hermeneutic approach straddled the sciences and the humanities in a way that is necessary to make progress studying meaning-centered phenomena.\n \nBio: Eric Wargo is the author of the book Time Loops: Precognition, Retrocausation, and the Unconscious (2018, Anomalist Books).

TSP utilizes very different concepts of targets, frontloads, client interaction and feedback, additional protocols such as synchronicities, scoring and judging variables, than other types of remote viewing. It therefore differs from “classical” Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) that was first developed back in 1973 by the author’s mentor, Ingo Swann, and physicists Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ. It also differs from Associative Remote Viewing (ARV) and Extended Remote Viewing (ERV) the other two major types of remote viewing developed with the military’s Stargate Project.  \n\nShe speaks about the consilience of TSP remote viewing and the element of synchronicity. One of the protocols used in TSP, not used in any other type of remote viewing, is that of synchronicity. The term, first coined by Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung who spent much of his life developing and redefining the concept, is today generally considered to be a “meaningful coincidence” of events.  The author demonstrates, using a sample group of all 70 TSP clients for the last two years, the relationship between synchronistic events and her remote viewing data. The TSP sessions show a high correlation of synchronistic events that support the thematic content of the client’s target questions and the viewer’s data. This, in turn, suggests a possible causal relationship beyond Jung’s definition of synchronicities as being “acausal” or “random” events deemed to coincide solely by virtue of the percipient’s retroactive feeling of “meaningfulness.”  \n\nBio: Nancy du Tertre graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University and with honors from Pace Law School.  She has owned several businesses, practiced securities litigation as an attorney in New York, published five books on various topics, teaches and lectures on remote viewing, psychic detective work, alien languages and mediumship.  Additionally, she is a former CBS radio show host, environmentalist, and active in local politics.  The author is not a “natural” psychic, but 100 percent trained in the psychic arts.

Schwartz presents an anthropological assessment of religions and spiritual practices stripped of their sectarian dogmas. He discusses them not on the basis of faith, but as systems of empirical observational science, developed over generations, for the purpose of allowing followers the opportunity to open to nonlocal consciousness. Schwartz describes how religions begin as the result of a single individual having a nonlocal, or a series of nonlocal, consciousness experiences, laying out the steps by which that single personal experience becomes a religion, and then examines and explains why the spiritual rituals and practices common to religions across time, geography, and culture grow from the experiences of the founder. It describes all of this using scientific experimental research from many different disciplines to show how the empirical sciences of religions, and the spiritual practices they engender are, in fact, supported by a myriad of studies, showing in the process: why water and wine are so often a part of religious rituals; why healing is so common across religions; why sacred spaces are significant, and how they are created; and why scriptures, and even the manner in which they are written, matter in these empirical systems.\n\nBio: Stephan A.

Graff | Evidence for Consciousness Extending Outside of Space-Time","description":"Dale E. Graff asks: How can precognition occur? What are the implications of precognition? What can we do with this natural ability? In this study, there was no pre-prepared target pool for future random selection, as is typical for other precognitive experiments. Graff used future newspaper photographs as psi objectives.  \n\nAbstract: Experimental projects were performed for accessing information that only existed in the future. These experiments provided insight into the processes for information access and how various extraordinary experiences are similar or are related. \n\nThe primary experimental project was for perceiving photographs published seven days in the future on a specific newspaper page. This was follow-on to a previous future news project for photographs three days ahead. For both of these projects, the events and the corresponding photographs did not exist at the time of the perceptions that were sought during the conscious state and the dream state.   Other projects were for target pictures randomly selected three days in the future and for picture selected in the future based on sporting events results or stock market levels, some for seven days ahead.  Synchronistic experiences occurred and some dreams became lucid as extended forms of consciousness.  Other dreams had images that symbolized the process involved in the perceptions.  \n\nA key finding from these experiments is that the future influences the present in a retrocausal sense and that the future interacts with cognitive process to provide information for action response. The responses can be through intuitions, dreams, spontaneous actions or synchronicities. This suggests that an interactive process with the future based on a unity or holistic principle involving precognition, retrocausation and synchronicity is an on-going subconscious activity. The ability to interact with the future indicates that consciousness has an aspect that is not constrained to space-time parameters. The fundamental constructive principle involved is based on information correlation in the context of relevance, meaning, or goals, and may have connections at a biological level with evolution processes.  An unusual synchronicity illustrates an accurate timing correlation.  \n\nThe potential source of the perceptions and the meaning of “the future” are reviewed.  Suggestions for research and applications are provided.  \n\nBio: Dale E. Graff has degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Physics.   He has been involved in various personal and professional forms of psi research for over 40 years, continues facilitating workshops with focus on dream state psi and performing investigations into precognition, retrocausation and synchronicity.

Schumann resonance frequencies were used to create a specific subtle energy pattern corresponding to these frequencies. This pattern was embedded in the existing device, EMF Transformer, that already was used successfully to counteract harmful effects of the cell-phone EMF radiation. EMF Transformer was tested using QEEG by Dr. Jeffrey Fannin, Ph.D., at the Center Cognitive Enhancement in Glendale, Arizona. It was shown that this device, placed as a sticker on the back side of the phone, successfully harmonizes brainwaves overexcited by the cell-phone radiation during a call. The Schumann resonance subtle energy pattern embedded into the EMF Transformer made this device much more efficient helping EMF-sensitive people to improve their quality of life. \n\nBio: Igor Nazarov, Ph.D. graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1977 with honors, getting MS degree in Nuclear Physics. Three years later defended his Ph.D. dissertation in chemical physics at the same institution. He continued to work at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology as the Assistant Dean of the Faculty of Molecular and Chemical Physics and as the Senior Researcher at the Molecular Physics Laboratory until his emigration to the USA in 1990.

Results of this work were published in June 2018 in the Proceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal. \n\n“Stress Relief” (SR) showed a reversal of stress-decreased locomotor activity in all stress models - distance walked increased almost twice, central zone crossings and time spent in it were 2–4 times greater than in the control group, and fast movement episodes and maximal speed increased by 50–200%. In addition, complete normalization of stress-induced elevation of blood glucose level was noted. These results demonstrate for the first time that the effect of SR formula (mineral water solution processed by VFT) can be observed in laboratory animals, and that the effects are significant and repeatable. \n\nSR pattern was also tested on humans (10-15 drops of the energy infused mineral solution in 2-4 oz. of water) using the heart rate variability (HRV) method. Positive shifts were observed in most of the HRV parameters, particularly in the relationship of the sympathetic to parasympathetic response. Shifts in heart rate, myocardial response, high frequency and low frequency neurological function, ‘total power’ and vascular compliance were observed repeatedly. Positive reactions in reserve power; vascular compliance, reserve capacity, and physical fitness measurements were seen consistently. \n\nPresented results, along with other experiments conducted in collaboration with different scientific labs, clearly confirm that subtle energy deserves title “the Life Force” and opens numerous possibilities for the development of various tools for the energy medicine. \n\nBio: Dr. Yury Kronn, President and CEO at Energy Tools International, OR, was educated at Gorky University and earned his post-doctorate degree at Lebedev's Institute of Physics. He developed the first four-photon tunable laser, headed up research on lasers and nonlinear optics, developed a comprehensive theory of quantum nonlinear interaction of the electro-magnetic field with matter, and unraveled a series of nonlinear optics phenomena that had puzzled scientists for years. He was also an Adjunct Professor at both Moscow University and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

Emmons | Managing the Medically Mysterious: Scientific, Paranormal, and/or Spiritual?","description":"“Integrative medicine” (previously “alternative medicine” and “complementary medicine”) has become mainstreamed in the sense that it is taught in virtually all medical schools.  Reasons given for this trend include rising costs of medical care, democratization of medical knowledge, and increasing health consumer demand.  Nevertheless, there is still significant resistance to integrative medicine in the Western biomedical establishment, and integrative medical theories and practices continue to be controlled and marginalized.  There are continuing boundary issues between the mainstream biomedical paradigm and a wide range of alternative beliefs and practices.\n\nThis particular research focuses on the orientations of practitioners and clients who are involved to varying degrees in integrative medicine (including spiritual/energy healing, meditation, massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, and yoga).  Based primarily on 53 ethnographic interviews in the United Kingdom and the United States (2016-2018), this presentation deals with how such practices are framed as scientific, paranormal, and/or spiritual. Very few practitioners and clients have a paranormal conceptualization.  These frames are important to the processes of legitimization and acceptance of the practices.\n\nBio: Charles Emmons has an MA in Anthropology from the University of Illinois and a PhD in Sociology from the University of Illinois, Chicago.  He is Prof. of Sociology at Gettysburg College, Pennsylvania.  He authored or co-authored Chinese Ghosts Revisited (2017), Science and Spirit: Exploring the Limits of Consciousness (2012), Guided by Spirit: A Journey into the Mind of the Medium (2003, 2019), and At the Threshold: UFOs, Science and the New Age (1997).

To help cover this serious gap in the comprehension of reality and consciousness manifestation, the author designed and conducted series of experiments using fMRI and other forms of NMR focused on the research and understanding of: 1. Neurological changes of the brain during execution of bioenergy techniques and vibrational state; 2. How to detect and measure bioenergy, based on its effects over matter; and 3. Mechanism of consciousness-matter interaction via bioenergy. This paper intends to present thought-provoking experimental and laboratorial findings and their preliminary analysis, including of bioenergy transmission to different types of substances and “objects”, like a “fMRI reference phantom”, a potato, an egg, and a person’s brain. It will also discuss some of their consequences and possible uses, including the possible future development of a “bioenergy technology”. In a consilience approach, it intends to bring more support to and evidence of subtle energy, summing up to historical cases of spiritual healing and to the vast field of phenomena usually called psychic experiences. It aims also to motivate researchers to replicate and analyze his experiments.\n\nBio: Wagner Alegretti is an electronic engineer who has worked with electrical power generation, medical equipment and software development. He has been researching out-of-body experiences and developing means to detect life’s subtle energy and to create a bioenergy technology since the 1980’s. His most recent experiments use fMRI and other forms of nuclear magnetic resonance to detect, measure and understand bioenergy. Author of the book Retrocognitions, published in many languages, he is a co-founder of the International Academy of Consciousness (IAC), was its president from 2001 to 2014, and is its current scientific director.

Sturrock | Behind the Mask: The Hidden Content of the Dedication of Shakespeare’s Sonnets","description":"The identity of the Great Author known as “William Shakespeare” has – until recently - been a mystery. His purported identity as a plebeian from Stratford-upon-Avon (William Shakspere, who could not even write his own name) has been a monumental - and incredibly successful - red herring.  There appears to have been a state-sponsored imposition that the great author’s identity should not be revealed - not only during his lifetime, but also on and after his death (for reasons that are yet to be adequately explored). However, the Dedication of Shake-Speares Sonnets has recently been found to contain cryptograms - composed one can infer by the great author – rather like a message in a bottle thrown into the ocean of time that has surfaced four hundred years later.\n\nBio: Peter Andrew Sturrock (b 1924) has had a long scientific career, and has published articles on electron physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics, solar physics, astrophysics, mathematics, statistics, scientific inference, parapsychology and UFO research.

He has received awards from the Gravity Foundation, NASA, the American Astronomical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the National Academy of Sciences. Sturrock received the Society’s Dinsdale Award in 2006, and he received the Vero Nihil Verius award from Concordia University in 2014 for his research on the Shakespeare Authorship Question.

The effects observed in these experiments and their applications tend to reveal a number of interesting properties not commonly observed elsewhere in the physical sciences: \n\n• Non-locality in space and time (with apparent room for retrocausation)\n• “Goal-Seeking” causality that acts agnostic to mechanism and physical substrate\n• Response to experimenter and participant psychology and expectations \n• Coordination of observed outcomes based on situational meaning \n\nAfter a brief overview of some of these properties and their relevance, we will look for consilience between the so-called “PK” or “influence” effect in REG applications and other consciousness-related anomalies such as remote viewing, healing, telepathy, and precognition.  We will then explore the possibility that all such phenomena can be re-described in terms of a single effect and use clues from across disciplines and experimental outcomes to ascertain details about its structure and behavior.\n\nWe will share a short list of possible implications for other disciplines ranging from biology to entrepreneurship, experimental design with psi, and managing anomalies in one’s own life.\n\nBio: John Valentino worked for several years at the PEAR laboratory, where he conducted experiments in mind-matter interaction using Random Event Generators, and then was co-founder of Psyleron, a company that makes REG hardware devices and software available to researchers and members of the public.

In the first few years, the SSE symposia and JSE often included topics of UFO report photo analysis or speculation on extraterrestrials, but in the last decade, there has been little to no apparent interest in the UFO topic. \n\nWhen I served on the SSE Council for several years, I volunteered to attempt to stimulate some scientific examination of the UFO topic, but I insisted that it should include the evaluation of “leaked” classified material, which was not acceptable to the Council.\n \nIn 2009 William Tompkins was encouraged by a couple of SSE members to contact me because I had become involved in UFO document authentication and might be interested in his story. His credibility was very high with me because we worked for the same company at the same time. As I learned his story for an autobiography, I found not only that the questioned documents that I had been examining were essentially valid, but that the level of secrecy sophistication went far beyond what I had imagined. This talk will include a listing of the processes used to keep facts secret. \n \nWhile it is true that although there are thousands of UFO reports and that some of them are misperceptions of ordinary phenomena, the UFO reporting history includes a large number that are consistent with real craft and real occupants. Included in this number are various reports of consciousness and time-related reports. Examples would be numerous cases of “missing time” by abductees, recollection of living past lives, the ability to program craft direction and control by thought processes, as well as regular telepathic communication with alien species..   \n \nI believe that the propulsion procedures for traveling at “warp speed” between the stars has already been secretly accomplished and that the technology to do it well includes consciousness control, and that this has been kept secret with remarkable effectiveness, thereby preventing us ordinary “uncleared” scientists from learning those “new equations” that will represent a concilience of ufology and consciousness.   \n\nBio: Robert M.

The main challenge faced by parapsychology and related disciplines is that the observed effects are subtle and stochastic, which stands in the way of making their findings technologically useful and creates as an obstacle to their acceptance. Homeopathy is a healing method that has practical import while sharing a theoretical foundation with these disciplines.\n\nHomeopathy is based on the principle that each of the manifold substances in the universe possesses a distinct energetic signature. It is a medicine of consciousness that relies primarily on the experience and meaning of the patient’s suffering rather than on the disease’s material manifestations. Homeopathy’s foundational principle, the ‘law of similars’, posits that energetic resonance between disease states and substances of animate, inanimate, or non-material (radiative) origin tends to produce curative effects in living organisms, improving the organism’s overall state of being rather than isolated symptoms; in spiritually-oriented individuals it also catalyzes accelerated spiritual evolution.\n\nHomeopathy is a scientifically testable (and tested) technology that, like parapsychology and related disciplines, is in search of a new paradigm to make its findings explicable on their own terms and relatable to materialist science. It cannot be interpreted within an atomistic framework but must be considered in the context of a field theory such as morphic field theory. Homeopathy thus provides explicit evidence for the interconnectedness of all of life and matter, lending direct empirical support to the premise of extended consciousness in general and to strong panpsychism in particular.\n\nThe ultramolecular dilutions used in homeopathy, which have been subject to increasing scientific scrutiny in recent years, offer an additional avenue for exploring consilience with other disciplines, since a given homeopathic remedy can be said to contain the immaterial essence of the substance from which it is derived through repeated dilution and vigorous shaking. This transition from matter to spirit is intriguing empirically – suggesting that a common physical mechanism underlies both the physical and energetic realms – and philosophically – demonstrating the possibility of transitioning between the Kantian sensible and intelligible realms and thereby coming to know things-in-themselves.\n\nBio: David Nortman, Hon.B.A., M.A., N.D. is a naturopathic doctor and specialist in homeopathic medicine. He is a graduate of the University of Toronto, Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, and Tel-Aviv University, where he obtained his Master’s degree in philosophy. He is currently writing a textbook on homeopathy and philosophy of science.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Broomfield, Colorado 2019.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

There is a considerable amount of literature concerning each member of this subset, yet, to this author’s knowledge, no one has proposed a way of conceptualizing all these experiences in a unified way that is related to an underlying, scientific (yet non-reductive) theory of the mind-body relationship. The author’s mind-body theory, the Theory of Essence, is a dualistic interactionist theory that is based on the intersubjective data of the near-death experience and integrates those data with classical and modern physics in such a way as to explain what mind is without reducing it to the functioning of the brain. The theory holds that the mind is formed in the interaction between the non-material “essence” (the seat of consciousness, thought, memory, and personality that survives the death of the body) and the living human brain. The theory is capable of uniting death-related anomalies in a consistent way to form something of a continuum illustrating the connections among these anomalies. These include: (1) out-of-body experiences; (2) near-death experiences; (3) ghosts/orbs; (4) after-death communications; (5) mediumship; and (6) reincarnation. Theory of Essence unites these six phenomena under the umbrella of temporary or permanent dissociation of the essence from the body; in the cases of permanent dissociation, the disembodied essence attempts to communicate with living persons in the physical world, or returns to the physical world to live another lifetime. Thus, there is a single conceptual framework tying a temporary, non-life-threatening experience (OBEs) with the beginning of a completely new life cycle (reincarnation) and several phenomena in-between. Death and related phenomena reach consilience through the Theory of Essence.\n\nBio: Kenny Arnette is a rogue consciousness researcher with a dualistic bent.

The materialist model upon which much of western science is based assumes that the physical world consists of matter and energy, and exists independently of any conscious awareness of it.  Matter and energy have evolved through law-like processes to somehow (mysteriously) produce consciousness as an emergent property of that evolution.\n\nIn the materialist view of the world, physics begets chemistry, which begets biology, from which emerges mind and consciousness.\n\nThe relatively new “post-materialism” suggests that the old assumption of more complex emergent properties resulting from lower rungs in a hierarchy of organization is incomplete and of questionable order.  Instead, “consciousness,” widely experienced but little understood, is the primary building block of nature.  From this primacy of consciousness emerges the familiar hierarchy of knowledge.\n\nIt seems that looking at data from either a matter/energy materialist perspective or the post-materialist promotion of “consciousness” to primacy will not be sufficiently comprehensive to further consilience in understanding what we currently call anomalous healing.  A more productive approach for consilience may be to emphasize “information” as the primary variable.\nConsider:\n• There is a dose response to healing\n• Healing does not diminish with distance (non-locality)\n• The more aggressive the cancer, the quicker it will be cured\n• The more mice in an experiment, the faster they collectively are cured (group bonding)\n• Only when mice have cancer and are treated by healing will anomalous output be obtained when running either REGs or geomagnetic probes in the room\n• The brains of the healer and the healee separated by some distance, exhibit something analogous to “phase locking” (non-local group bonding)\n• Healing is an autonomic response to the need of the healee, and occurs without conscious awareness on the part of either the healer or the healee (conscious attention is unnecessary)\n• Control mice can become part of the larger “resonant collective” of the experiment and be healed without overt treatment\n• Healing can be “stored” in living mice, and in both organic and inorganic materials\n• Healing can be “recorded” by devices of various construction, and those recordings will essentially reproduce the healing without any human intervention\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Broomfield, Colorado 2019.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, Gene Thomas, and Sandy Wiener. \n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Against that attitude, this presentation argues that existing research has already assembled multiple lines of mutually supporting, consilient evidence for an alternative explanatory framework that accounts for observations presently reckoned anomalous without losing the explanatory power of conventional models. One potential example of such a framework is described, with a summary of the observational genres that provide consilient evidence for its components.\r\n\nThe framework discussed here is necessarily an incomplete outline. In some cases, this is an acknowledgment that incomplete knowledge leads to some freedom being retained in the structure. For example, at the deepest level of explanation, this framework takes consciousness to be a fundamental component of reality, rather than an emergent or derived property of complicated systems. This does not entail that consciousness is the only fundamental component from which everything else is derived. Theory-building at this stage can safely be agnostic between this purely idealistic stance and alternatives such as panpsychic physicalism in which consciousness is an aspect of the most fundamental entities in the theory without being the whole of them.\r\n\nIn deliberate analogy to the mainstream structure of reductionistic physicalism, this basic premise is shown to receive consilient support from multiple, less fundamental theoretical findings. These in turn are themselves supported by multiple consilient lines of evidence from independent genres of investigation. For example, the thesis that consciousness can directly affect physical events, without the mediation of any currently understood physical mechanism, is supported not only by laboratory investigations of “PK” phenomena, but by demonstrations of macro-PK training (as presented at the 2018 meeting), by well-documented reports of RSPK, by DMILS experiments, and other evidence. Several other topics are developed similarly. Finally, the concluding section of the presentation will point out areas where further investigation seems needed before a high level of consilience is reached.\r\n\nBio: York Dobyns was educated at Ohio University and Princeton University.

Karl Popper famously considered both astrology and Freudian psychoanalysis to be pseudosciences, because both failed his falsifiability standard. Arguments can be made that certain “pseudosciences” meet or exceed the same expectations made of other, more accepted science. The fact that there seems no clear specification of what counts as scientific evidence fuels the ambiguity. When research is rejected as not producing evidence that is sufficiently “scientific,\" we can challenge that judgment with questions. \"What, then, constitutes scientific evidence?\", we might ask. Or, \"How should we define scientific evidence?\" A search of the literature turns up few hard and fast criteria. This presentation will attempt to fill the gap by offering seven qualities which could reasonably be expected of a body of evidence to consider it “scientific,” along with discussion as to why these should count as defining characteristics of scientific evidence and how they may apply to examples of parapsychology evidence.\r\n\nBio: Paul H.

Harald Walach has written such a report, which he presents. The argument starts with the insight that all human endeavors are necessarily founded on absolute presuppositions in the sense of Collingwood and that the current presuppositions of science are largely predicated on a materialist worldview. This has served us well up to a point. It seems that we have reached a stage in science and society at large, where an exclusive reliance on such a worldview could prove not only limiting, but dangerous. Evidence that points towards the necessity of broadening such a view comes from some areas of anomalistic science: reports of veridical cases of non-local perception during near-death experiences, the cumulated data-base of experimental parapsychology, evidence of case reports from children with memories of previous lives, to name but three. This type of phenomenology cannot be incorporated into the current world model. This is why these phenomena are largely ignored. If we, however, take these phenomena seriously, as the report suggests, we can broaden our view. The basic requirement for this is a twin acceptance of a world-model that provides for some non-locality and for consciousness to have some causal and possibly independent ontological status. A minimum consensus model would be a dual-aspect theory of consciousness. A model that can incorporate non-locality would either have to resort to a field, or to a generalized form of non-locality as derivable from a generalized quantum theoretical framework, as we have proposed. Such a broadened view would by necessity be inclusive and would lead to different types of research questions being pursued and would also propose an overall connectedness both of mankind, but also with nature and the planet at large. The ramifications for teaching and research are obvious and will be outlined.\r\n\r\nBio: Harald Walach has Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and in History and Theory of Science.

O. Wilson published \"Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge\", suggesting that different avenues of evidence could link together to create a common groundwork of explanation in the search for human wisdom. He proposed that science could join hands with the humanities and religion in this task. In subsequent years, Wilson has walked back this claim by asserting that religions are “dragging us down” and should be “eliminated.” This discussion will examine precursors to the idea of consilience, how the idea has penetrated contemporary culture, and how eminent scientists have supported the interpenetration of science, religion, and spirituality. We will see how the profession of medicine has been periodically reshaped in profound ways through the consilience of several factors, including the evidence for the fundamental, causal nature of consciousness. We will examine consilience interruptus— the obstruction to a deeper process of consilience in medical science: the materialistic dogma that the brain produces, confines, and limits the manifestations of consciousness. Actual clinical cases will illustrate these issues.\r\n\nBio: Dr. Larry Dossey is an internal medicine physician, former Chief of Staff of Medical City Dallas Hospital, and former co-chairman of the Panel on Mind/Body Interventions, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been treated since then and have claimed that their allergy to pollens or animal hair is gone: no more runny noses, sneezing, asthma, or anaphylactic reactions to peanuts, rashes or hives.\n\nNAET is a holistic method, based upon the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, that combines acupuncture, kinesiology, allopathy, chiropractic and nutrition.\n\nThe NAET hypothesis is that the presence of an opposing electromagnetic field from a substance may adversely affect the energy of the human body. This disturbance in the energy pathways leads to the symptoms associated with diseases or allergic processes. When the person is in the presence of the allergen, stimulation of areas on the back is thought to reprogram the energy pathways to tolerate the allergen and prevent allergic reactions.\n\nExpressing it in different terms, the presence of information perceived as a threat by the system (human body) produces blockages in its energy flow. These disturbances will start different physiologic defense responses like: allergies, intolerances, pain, inflammation and self-immune disorders. When blockages are removed from the system, in the presence of the information that is causing them, and when some simple rules are followed, the result is that information is no longer perceived as a threat by the body. Consequently its presence will no longer produce blockages and then the system will not start physiological defense. By adding information to the system, we reduce its tendency to chaos.\n\nAutism is a neurological disorder that is sweeping through the world at an alarming rate, currently affecting as many as 1 in every 68 children, according to 2010 statistics. In 2000, the ratio was 1 in 150. That’s a 45% increase in 10 years. At this rate, in the next 10 years, the statistics will rise to 1 in every 30 children, and 10 years after that, 1 in every 14.\n\nThere is no medication that can cure autism, and the medications that are currently in force to curb some of the symptoms have side effects such as seizures, addiction, anxiety, hallucinations, depression, infections and high blood pressure.\n\nIn 2005 NAET research has shown in a study to improve symptoms and autism behaviors. Approximately 88% of the children treated with NAET had their autism diagnosis removed by their own individual doctors and neurologist. The NAR (Nambudripad Allergy Research) Foundation is conducting a global study on NAET’s effectiveness in the treatment of autism on 1000-1200 autistic patients.\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to describe the methods and nature of the study.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The discovery in 1900 of the recursive paradox in mathematics by Bertrand Russell, and in the same year the use of a constant h to solve the electromagnetic black body problem by Max Planck, opened the door to two trains of thought that led respectively to complexity theory and quantum mechanics.\n\nDuring the 20th century, complexity theory was heralded by Kurt Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem, which verified that the recursive paradox would never go away. That led the way to complex adaptive systems and complexity theory, in which unpredictable events spontaneously emerge from chaos. In parallel, quantum mechanics was realized through extremely reliable observations about the nature of reality—quantum particles do not exist until they are observed, can be in two places at the same time, are here and then appear over there without traversing the intervening space, and can affect one another instantaneously at-a-distance.\n\nSuch counterintuitive dynamics have not yet been applied to empirical biomedical science, in which objective, cause-and-effect studies with statistical analyses are the strict standard of research and treatment of disease. But, is it possible that complexity and quantum could be applied to the empirical methodology of ordinary biomedical science? After all, the human body is the most complex entity we know of in the universe. Moreover, human physiology is powered by chemical “transport” proteins, which exchange subatomic particles within human cells, and neuropeptides which constantly transport subatomic particles within neuronal synapses and at neuroreceptors throughout the body.\n\nThe goals of SSE include bringing improved understanding to those restrictive worldviews that limit scientific inquiry. Is it possible that in a kind of recursive paradox our culture’s rigid commitment to ordinary biomedical science is one of those restrictive worldviews?\n\nHow might one design a biomedical research project that included spontaneous emergence out of chaos and the existence of a quantum particle in two places at the same time? To begin with we might consider: qualities as well as quantities, the subjective as well as objective, wholeness as well as fragmentation, and the imaginary numbers in Mendelbrot’s fractals.\n\nWhat paths might we take, what discussions might be engage in, what conferences might we participate in to bring about a union of ordinary biomedical science with the new sciences of the 21st century?\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

An understanding of how minerals direct the three- dimensional structure of amino acids is explored along with the laws of physics as they relate to minerals. This in turn affects how DNA becomes RNA and how RNA creates three-dimensional proteins.\n\nThe relationship of minerals to subatomic particles as it ties in to the constant flow of magnetic energy in the human body will be explored. Understanding the constant flow of energy as it pertains to the circadian rhythms, acupuncture, and gene expression entanglement will be introduced. An understanding of what are the most important minerals to keep the human gene code working will be explained.\n\nAubrey Keith Brewer (1893–1986) developed a theory of the High pH Cancer Therapy with the mineral cesium and this grew out of his understanding of the physics of the cell membrane. Later studies by Dr. Marilyn Tufte confirmed uptake of cesium by cancer cells. “Alkalize or Die” is a saying in the alternative health industry in reference to cancer treatment and cesium is at the center of the therapy that Dr. Brewer was utilizing in an effort to control the proliferation of cancer cells. The cesium that is used in alternative cancer procedures is referred to as cesium chloride and vibrates or resonates at different frequencies to that of radioactive cesium.\n\nThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has provided the entire Northern Hemisphere with an abundant amount of cesium in the form of cesium 137 and cesium 135. The consequences of such widespread radioactive particles affect the genetic stability of DNA-based life forms. What are the consequences of the other radioactive minerals such as strontium 90, iodine 131, xenon 131, 133, 135, 137, and 138, tellurium 129, chlorine 38, cesium 134, 136, and 137, arsenic 74, yttrium 91, and lanthanum 140?\n\nThe fallout effect on plants is also documented. Fasciation, or cresting, in plants is a rare disorder marked by abnormal growth. It is predominantly caused by a mutation in the meristematic tissue. Plants in the Northern Hemisphere are showing increased signs of fasciation and radioactive stress. As expected, fasciation is more common now in Tokyo, Japan, where it affects dandelions so readily that it is becoming “common”. Increased levels of fasciation are occurring even in our country, but to a lesser degree.\n\nCesium follows the potassium, sodium, rubidium, and lithium pathways in the human body. Any alteration to cesium can and often does affect these other pathways. Proper mineralization through a change in diet or via supplementation can help prevent or mitigate the fallout effects. Mineralization can help to prevent genetic mutation or fasciation in our biological society and the reasons why will be discussed.\n\nBio: Dr. Richard N.

In particular, a number of seemingly disparate and unconventional biomedical observations, including those in; radionics; “healing” (cancer reversal etc.); electromagnetic olfaction in insects and developmental processes, may be associated with common biochemical pathways. Though yet to be studied in detail, these phenomena share plausible mechanisms involving small molecule interactions, chiral and non chiral catalysis, and quantum electron tunneling. These observations and biochemical mechanisms will be presented, focusing on their conceptual overlap, with the ultimate goal of formulating testable hypotheses.\nAdditionally an examination of the process of assembling “Chains of Thought” from the conceptual intersections presented, will be examined with two reasons in mind. First of all, in order to present a more complete picture of the phenomena discussed and their relationship to each other and second to demonstrate how an even larger set of phenomena might be linked to the those presented, in the hope of encouraging the examination of the phenomena presented in an increasingly interdisciplinary manner.\n\nCarl G.

Eberl","description":"In 2002, Line Brunet de Courssou, a philanthropist working in Cote d’Ivoire, Africa, observed that French Green clays killed Buruli ulcer. This infection, by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a flesh-eating disease that attacks the subcutaneous lipids causing flesh removal over large areas of the body. Courssou had presented to the World Health Organization (WHO), photo-documentation of her treatment of over a hundred people with the disease. Using daily applications of the green clay poultice (mud), she healed infections that did not respond to any known antibiotic, and normally required excision or amputation.\n\nOur decade of research on clays that kill human pathogens, including antibiotic resistant strains such as methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), has since documented their common characteristics. Having tested dozens of clays worldwide, similar to the French green clay, about 10% have shown antibacterial effects on model Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens. Common among the antibacterial clays are that they each contain phases with reduced iron (e.g., pyrite, magnetite, jarosite) and phyllosilicates including dominantly illitesmectite. However, the mineralogy alone does not define antibacterial clay. Another common characteristic is the dominance of nanometric particle sizes. Testing various size fractions of clay has shown that the finest fraction is antibacterial, whereas the coarser fractions are not. Furthermore, oxidation of the clay removes the antibacterial effect.\n\nCritically important is the role of the clay mineral surface in buffering the water pH to conditions 4 or 10, where Al and Fe dissolve from various minerals in the clay. Because of the enormous surface area of expandable clays (smectites), metals adsorb to their interlayer surfaces. When the clays are taken out of their natural environment and mixed with de-ionized water for a medicinal poultice, cation exchange and mineral dissolution releases reduced metals that become oxidized, generating hydroxyl radicals that damage organic compounds in the bacterial cell and cause metabolic malfunction in the bacteria. Different modes of action have been documented for different clay mineralogies, but in each case the role of the clay is either to flood pathogens with toxic metals (e.g., Fe, Al), or to rob bacteria of essential nutrients (Ca, Mg, P). Lessons learned will drive the design of new treatments for antibiotic resistant bacteria.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The majority of funding for TBI research is directed towards understanding the pathophysiology of disease and developing methods or equipment to decrease the likelihood of traumatic brain injury occurring as a consequence of violent or repeated insults to the head.\n\nOur goal is to successfully treat both the acute and chronic forms of TBI with the same therapeutic agent even though the two are generally considered to be distinct entities. The product we are developing to accomplish that end is an oxidized form of streptolysin O, the exotoxin of group A streptococci that causes the pain of a sore throat. We call it SLO.\n\nAfter over ten years of in vitro experiments, in vivo evaluation in both laboratory and domestic animals, and human anecdotal experience, we have shown SLO to be a potent agent for preventing scars and for ameliorating scars present for as long as six decades. The question has been one of whether the same SLO that has such a profound effect on both internal and external scars could likewise influence brain “scars” where little or no collagen is present.\n\nA small number of ex-NFL players, professional boxers, and accident victims were treated with sublingual drops of SLO for periods ranging from two months to nearly a year. Patients included some football players with an estimated quarter million hits to their head and a woman in a severe auto accident 30 years prior to initiating SLO therapy. All showed significant improvement.\n\nTo better understand the in vivo mechanism(s) of action of SLO, the molecule was evaluated in an accepted mouse model for the acute form of TBI. Injured mice treated with SLO showed a statistically significant improvement in the Morris Water Maze Test for memory versus injured and untreated animals. To a slightly lesser degree the treated mice also demonstrated improved balance. And as with humans, there were no adverse effects.\n\nHistopathologic examination of the brains of treated vs untreated animals shows that the former group had considerably less microglial infiltrations in the area of the hippocampus than did the injured and untreated group. This, combined with genomic data, strongly suggests that in the acute disease there is a decided inhibition of inflammation induced by SLO, and consequently there would be a decrease in gliosis and thus in what would be considered brain scarring.\nIn these early studies it would appear that SLO can prevent scarring in the acute phase of TBI and decrease scars in the brain that is chronically compromised – in both cases permitting improved function and consequent improved health.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Further, the hormetic effect is often seen graphically as a “J” or “U” shaped curve where doses higher or lower than the optimum can fail to induce any response or be toxic.\nOne such potent toxic substance is thimerosal, an agent long used as a topical disinfectant (Merthiolate) and as an anti-microbial preservative in vaccines. Thimerosal in vaccines has been a focus of heated discussions and lawsuits because of its implication as a possible cause of autism in vaccinated children.\n\nThe standard concentration of thimerosal in vaccines was one part in ten thousand (1:10,000), but a therapeutic dose has been found which is considerably lower yet significantly higher than what would be anticipated in a homeopathic remedy. This therapeutic dose is measurable by standard techniques, is stable, and is useful.\n\nFor the past two decades we have been working with thimerosal as an anti-viral agent for in vivo use in humans and domestic animals. While showing some modest activity against adeno- and polyomaviruses, it is especially effective in combating viruses of the influenza and herpes families.\n\nAt first glance it would appear that these two virus classes have little in common. Influenza viruses have SS-RNA for their genetic material while herpes viruses have DS-DNA. Influenza infection is restricted to the respiratory tract while the herpes family can induce disease in a wide variety of tissues.\n\nWhat these two virus families do share is a replicative cycle that is the target of thimerosal therapy. That vulnerable step is associated with the assembly of virus particles after infection and uncoating in susceptible host cells.\n\nSuccessful interruption of viral progeny production translates to interruption of infection and often extremely rapid resolution of symptoms and restoration of the healthy state. FDA- authorized clinical trials for evaluating the safety and efficacy of thimerosal for the treatment of influenza and recurrent oral herpes infections have been initiated.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

It was designed to facilitate reunion experiences with deceased individuals, as a means of addressing the feelings surrounding bereavement. Although the modern psychomanteum is not normally employed to seek ESP information about the future, it may be that the psychomanteum is psi-conducive. For example, there are many similarities and differences between psychomanteum experiences and accounts of hypnagogic/ hypnopompic imagery, which is conducive to ESP. The aim is of this paper was to explore whether the psychomanteum technique encourages a psi-conducive state of consciousness, which would result in scoring that is significantly above MCE. One hundred and thirty participants (92 females and 38 males; Mean age= 47.44) were recruited by announcements in newspapers and our web site. Seventy-eight percent claimed to have had a variety of ESP experiences. A number of variables, such as vividness of imagery and hallucinatory experience, were examined. Two conditions, psychomanteum and non-psychomanteum, were compared. A CD-pool containing 200 high-quality color pictures, such as animals, icons, foods, people, landscapes, religion, scenic pictures, structures, and humoristic cartoons, was designed using a RNG for randomization. Under psychomanteum condition, psi-hitting was obtained (30.8% above MCE); however, under no-psychomanteum (“control”) condition, 29.2% was obtained (where 25% was expected). The results differ slightly from MCE in the psychomanteum condition (p = .02, one-tailed) in comparison with non-psychomanteum condition, but no significant differences were found. A number of positive correlations were also found, for instance, participants who attained higher scores on auditory and visual hallucinations tended to demonstrate psi-hitting.\n\nAlejandro Parra received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees from the Universidad Abierta Interamericana (www.vaneduc.edu.ar/uai), where he is now a teacher and associated researcher.

This presentation describes several well-controlled psi dream projects that illustrate the various pathways, or connections, that occur when the psi-accessed information is presented to subconscious and consciousness awareness. The data can be associated with features of triune brain functions — the reptilian, the limbic, and the neocortex. Some psi dream experiences are lucid; when the dreamer is aware of being in a dream. Possible connections between lucid dreaming and some of the incidents reported as UFO encounters are discussed. Potential sources of psi data and the relevance of a speculative quantum physics perspective published by Wolfram Schommers of the Nuclear Research Center, Karlsruhe, Germany, are considered. Schommers’ formulation presents energy and momentum as an abstract concept and the material universe as not embedded in space-time but as projected into it. The significance of this perspective for mind-energy interaction is discussed. Connections with neurophysiologists and other cognitive scientists in conventional research areas are suggested and include the National Institute of Health (NIH) and other organizations.\n\nDale E. Graff, M.S. Physics, is a researcher, writer, and speaker internationally known for his insights into the processes of the mind. He is recognized for his understanding of our natural psi talents as being a spectrum available while awake — Conscious State Psi (CSP) and while asleep and dreaming — Dream State Psi (DSP). His books, \"Tracks in the Psychic Wilderness\" and \"River Dreams\", have brought him international recognition as he describes his personal evolution from scientific doubter — degrees in aeronautical engineering and physics — to that of accepting the reality of psi abilities. These books have been praised for their honesty and for the way he presents psychic experiences in a neutral perspective, free of dogma and belief systems. He facilitates seminars and work- shops, performs psi investigations and publishing articles.\n\nRecorded at the 34th annual SSE Conference  in 2015 at the Hilton Washington DC/Rockville hotel.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The largest correlation was found with sidereal time. Psychic reception was most accurate in a time window centered around 13.5 hours sidereal. This corresponds to the time when the constellation Virgo is overhead. During this period psychic reception is about 4 times more accurate than during any other time of day.\n\nA possible explanation for this effect can be found by combining three insights from astronomy and Russian torsion research. They are as follows:\n1. “Left handed” torsion increases ESP abilities. This was asserted by Kozyrev in an interview in the 1970 book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain (Ostrander, 1970), and has been confirmed in later papers and by magnetic healing pioneers Davis and Rawls in experiments (Davis, 1975).\n2. In torsion experiments conducted by Kozyrev and independently confirmed by Lavrentiev, “left handed” torsion produces a “gravitation-like” effect. This implies that regions of space exhibiting anomalously strong gravity can be explained if they are charged with “left handed” torsion.\n3. The region of sky which is overhead at 13.5 hours sidereal is known as the “Great Attractor” because it is a region of anomalously strong gravity (dark matter).\n\nThe logical conclusion of these insights is that the “Great Attractor” which is overhead at 13.5 hours sidereal may be charged with “left hand” torsion, which is responsible for the high gravitational attraction, and this form of torsion has also been shown to cause an increase in ESP reception abilities. The supporting evidence behind each of these three claims will be discussed at greater length in the talk.\n\nThe larger issue implied by these observations is that “dark matter” and “dark energy,” which have puzzled the physics community, can be explained if torsion, as defined by Russian scientists, is included. Torsion occurs in two forms, left handed and right handed. The former appears to increase the attraction of masses and behaves as though it increases gravity, while right handed torsion appears to have the opposite effect. Therefore it may be possible to account for the puzzling observations regarding dark matter and dark energy if these two forms of torsion are considered.\n\nWhile virtually unknown among Western scientists, torsion has been studied and verified over a forty year period in Russia, and has given rise to inventions, technologies and patents. The application of torsion to the sidereal time peak, as well as to the “dark matter” and “dark energy” puzzles, are but a few of many anomalies which this force may be able to explain.\n\nReferences:\nSpottiswood, James, Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 109-122 (1997)\nOstrander, Sheila and Schroeder, Lynn, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, Bantam Books, New York (1970)\nDavis, Albert R. and Rawls, Walter C., The Magnetic Effect, Acres, U.S.A., Kansas City, MO (1975)\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

However, recent advances in physics have brought the topic into mainstream science. It behooves us to understand what the possible implications of this could be. One way to get a sense of these, is to move beyond dialectics to empiricism by considering other processes that appear to involved a significant degree of nonlocality: distant healing, remote viewing, and (if channeled messages are to be believed) the afterlife. The latter is particularly interesting, as it is often spoken of as being limitless, without the normal boundaries of space or time. Controlled remote viewing is likewise able to access information across space and time, while distant healing can be time- displaced and occur at a considerable distance. We will briefly look at what insights these can give us, including what resulted when \"the implications of nonlocality\" was used as a remote viewing target.\n\nPamela Rae Heath has an MD from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and practiced anesthesiology for nearly 30 years, serving as Chief of Anesthesia in Humana Hospital-Abilene and at Chinle Hospital on the Navaho Reservation. She began having spontaneous psychic experiences in the early 1990s, which led to her returning to graduate school for a doctorate in psychology with a dual specialization in parapsychology and hypnosis. Her dissertation was on mind-matter interaction.\n\nPamela Heath is a member of the Parapsychological Association, the Society for Psychical Research, and the Society for Scientific Exploration.

The study uses a variation of Pearlson and Folley’s (2008) strategy for locating alleles (alternative forms of a gene governing hereditary variation) based on evolutionary theory. The pilot study was guided by two theories: (1) A sheep theory hypothesizes that ESP alleles provide sufficient benefits to overcome the costs of schizophrenia. (2) A ritual healing theory argues that genes governing absorption and dissociation provided evolutionary benefits to archaic humans exposed to childhood trauma and shamanic healing. The ritual healing theory hypothesizes that shamanic healing, practiced by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers over many millennia, selected for alleles shaping anomalous experience, hypnotic suggestion, shamanism, and spirituality (McClenon, 1997, 2002a). Pearlson and Folley (2008) propose correlational mapping (multidimensional analysis) of community survey data to analyze hypothesized allele markers. The pilot study discusses the sheep theory and ritual healing theory with regard to allele markers. These theories predict existence of alleles governing ESP, absorption, dissociation, transliminality, boundary scales, and other anomalous experiences. A questionnaire was designed to measure frequency of anomalous experience, psychological symptoms, shamanic variables, childhood and adolescent difficulty, and other variables thought correlated with psychological symptoms (McClenon, 2012, 2013). Between 2001 and 2006, the questionnaire was administered to a non-random community sample in northeastern North Carolina (N = 965). The hypothesized allele markers were evaluated through correlational mapping of the survey data. Findings are based on five correlational maps (previously unpublished): (1) Anomalous experience variables were highly correlated with each other. (2) Particular correlational clusters, which suggest possible underlying alleles, include “waking ESP, OBE, apparitions,” “waking ESP, apparitions,” and “waking ESP, paranormal dreams, apparitions.” (3) Waking ESP and apparitions were highly correlated with shamanic variables but were generally not within shamanic variable correlational clouds. (4) Although waking ESP is highly correlated with schizophrenia symptoms, researchers have not uncovered major schizophrenia alleles. Failure to locate these alleles calls into question the sheep theory. (5) Cluster patterns suggest that the search for alleles associated with shamanic ritual will be fruitful. (6) Correlational mapping provides no evidence of a psi allele (waking ESP, paranormal dreams, PK). (7) Analysis provides a list of 16 variables most correlated with a “waking ESP, paranormal dreams, apparition” cluster. Although correlational mapping does not provide clear evidence for an ESP allele, these variables are possible allele markers. Pilot study results suggest theoretical revisions. A revised ritual healing theory hypothesizes that random genetic mutations are the source of anomalous experiences.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Graff","description":"I examine a range of unusual experiences to identify common elements and consider interpretations that may differ from those of the experiencer. A study of these experiences also provides insight into the boundaries of perception and the dualities of sensing and knowing.\nThese experiences include apparitions, hauntings, out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, synesthesia, spontaneous healings, UFO sightings and abduction accounts. They are from personal incidents reported to me through numerous workshops and seminars and from my own informal experimental investigations and spontaneous experiences. Some insights regarding UFO incidents are from my access to the Project Blue Book files and the UFO hot line reports when employed by the Air Force as a civilian physicist at the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), from discussions about an astronaut’s UFO sighting when I was an aeronautical engineer on the Gemini space program and from my position as Chief of the Advanced Concepts Office when preparing responses to queries about UFO sightings and other unusual incidents sent to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).\n\nIn my search for elements common to various unusual experiences I found that trauma had a role in some of the experiences and how they were perceived. Some had a symbolic or archetypal significance and some resembled lucid dreams. Some of the common elements were structural and had similar visual dynamics such as grids, and rotating indistinct imagery. I discuss the possible implications of these visual dynamics from a pattern recognition perspective and examine factors that relate to shifts in the boundaries of perception. I suggest that the mental state of lucid dreaming provides a convenient reference for evaluating a variety of experiences and discuss the role that psi, especially telepathy, has for various unusual experiences.\n\nDifferent modes of psi such as telepathy, clairvoyance, remote viewing, precognition and macropsychokinesis (macroPK), support a holographic interpretation of reality. An interdisciplinary study of the boundaries of perception can lead to new paradigms for understanding the conscious-subconscious domain. Understanding macroPK from a holographic viewpoint may provide clues into material transfer mechanisms.\n\nAs we learn more about the boundaries of perception and our subconscious, our psyche, the more feasible it will be to understand a variety of experiences and to know when psi contact with others, either from terrestrial or from non-terrestrial sources has occurred.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Some of these signals have been reported for centuries, even millennia. The list is long and diverse: changing well water levels, changing water chemistry, ground-hugging fog, low frequency electromagnetic emission, earthquake lights from ridges and mountain tops, magnetic field anomalies, transient anomalous radiant temperature anomalies over wide areas as seen in satellite images, changes in the plasma density of the ionosphere, and strange animal behavior. There still is great confusion, how these pre-EQ phenomena are generated, how they are interconnected, and whether they are even real. Today, 10 years later, we know that these pre-EQ phenomena can be traced to a single process: the stress- activation of electronic charge carriers in rocks, positive holes, which consist of defect electrons associated with energy levels as the upper edge of the valence band, chemically O– in a matrix of O2–. Lying normally dormant, when the positive holes wake up, they have the amazing ability to spread out of the stressed rock volumes, traverse tens of kilometers of rocks from deep in the Earth crust all the way to the surface. When they arrive, the Earth surface begins to sparkle and glow. On the basis of insight into the fundamental solid state processes involved, we can now begin implementing a Global Earthquake Forecasting System – a momentous task that will need a broad collaboration across many scientific disciplines and a healthy dose of political will.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

This is a modern-day version of the watchmaker analogy, the classic and ineffective teleogical argument for the existence of God. The typical objection to this analogy is that complex artifacts /creatures can be produced by a mindless natural process, as exemplified by the infinite monkey theorem. In the present work, I present an argument for a mindless natural process, self-organization, to be the origin of an evolutionary process that appears intelligent. Additionally, I present a technique for computing the spectral coefficient of a time- series of mutations which would determine the degree to which the advantageous and deleterious mutations are self-organized. Rather than being a true objection to the watchmaker argument as applied to Earth’s biodiversity, this viewpoint illustrates that a mindless natural process could also be intelligent, and allows for natural selection and intelligent design to be mutually inclusive.\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

By measuring electrical resistance in the leaves of plants, Backster demonstrated that plants were sensitive to events in the environment, including threats to the plant, death of nearby organisms, and human interaction, particularly human emotions. The current research sought to replicate some of Backster’s findings, focusing on spontaneous emotion during human interaction. Plant electrical activity was measured with a GSR device during conversations involving the experimenter and acquaintances, using a plant that the experimenter had cared for (Schefflera Arboricola, Trinette variety), for a duration of more than two years.\n\nComparisons were made of activity during 4-second intervals of time with the presence of emotions (e.g., anger, surprise, embarrassment) versus 4-second intervals of no activity in the room containing the plant, revealing a highly significant difference. A comparison of the emotional intervals against all other human interaction intervals was also highly significant. Controls employed indicate that these differences are not due to temperature, sound, or movement. Movement artifacts are particularly important to control for, as nearby movement produces electrical changes in the leaves, even without contact. Interaction intervals with possible movement artifacts were excluded from the calculations.\n\nThe importance of genuine emotion in evoking these responses points to the necessity of ecologically valid and spontaneous situations for a proper scientific study of plant perceptual responses. Further work needs to be done to replicate findings about long-distance effects, as well as other “Backster effects” involving single celled organisms and human cells. Additionally, the nature of the signal and the reason for electrical manifestation of these responses are in need of further investigation.\nContact information: Ben Bendig, M.A., C.Phil, UCLA Department of Psychology, bbendig@ucla.edu\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Dykstra","description":"It has long been known that insects smell odors through the use of their antennae. It is also well established that detection occurs via tiny sensillae on these antennae. Beyond this, our understanding of insect olfaction is limited and research results are conflicting. The current paradigm is that odorants pass through tiny holes in the insect sensillae and diffuse through the sensillar lymph to eventually bind with a protein receptor on the dendrite. The current paradigm touts diffusion as the proposed mechanism. Although seemingly plausible, scientific investigation reveals that this is not possible. Diffusion alone is not fast enough since insect electrophysiologists report that odorant detection can occur in less than one millisecond. Further to this, no receptor-ligand binding has ever been shown and so the putative protein receptor remains elusive.\n\nAn alternative theory is that the insect sensillae act as dielectric waveguides picking up the energy or vibrational energies of the odorants. This theory bypasses the problem with diffusion, but does not have a clear mechanism. Energy coupling via the antennae is easy enough to understand using antenna theory, but the message is somehow eventually detected by the dendrites thus initiating a standard nervous impulse. This can be partially understood utilizing our current knowledge of protein semiconductors and rhodopsin.\n\nBacteriorhodopsin has been well-studied as a phototransducing protein with an extremely fast response time. The protein responds to electromagnetic energy in 1.61 picoseconds and possesses a recovery time of 10 milliseconds. In fact, 98% of the bacteriorhodopsin molecules reset within 20 milliseconds. In relation to insect olfaction, this recovery period is well within the recovery times reported in the scientific literature (several hundred milliseconds). Therefore, based on the temporal evidence, it is plausible that a similar mechanism might be at work in regards to insects.\n\nThe proteins most likely involved in insect olfaction include odorant receptor proteins and sensory neuron membrane proteins. The odorant receptor proteins are seven transmembrane proteins, similar to bacteriorhodopsin. However, sensory neuron membrane proteins are reported to be in higher concentrations than odorant receptors on the dendrite. Either of these proteins, or alternatively both proteins acting in concert, can be implicated as in vivo protein semiconductors. This new theory would help to explain how insects can detect odorants on the established temporal scale.\n\nTom Dykstra is Secretary of the SSE and is President of Dykstra Laboratories, Inc which is a laboratory devoted to electromagnetics and life.

Evaporation involves fourth-phase water rising in the form of negatively charged aerosol droplets, while positive charges rise in the form of hydronium ions. The negative-positive combination may condense into clouds. In sunshine, the evaporated hydronium ions build high into the atmosphere, while at nighttime they hardly build at all; hence, horizontal charge gradients form at the day-night boundaries. Those charge gradients, I suggest, drive wind flow, and more generally may be the cause of wind. I suggest further that those persistent winds may help spin the earth endlessly on its axis.\n\nBio: Gerald Pollack received his PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.

A bio-location methodology has been performed trying to map crustal faults in and around Vrancea. Bio-location measurements measured across tectonic faults and geomagnetic continuous recordings have been used in the last decade in order to correlate the data to the local and regional earthquake activity. Certain correlations had been claimed, but they have been rejected by mainstream geophysics, due to an after-the-fact subjective evaluation. As a result, a real-time evaluation and stress forecasting has been proposed and implemented during the years 2009–2012.\n\nA stress forecasting of a large earthquake for a window of time October 22–26, 2011, was issued to the National Institute for Earth Physics (INFP), on October 21 at 10:00 AM. A large earthquake magnitude 7.2 was recorded in Van, Eastern Turkey, on October 23. Another stress forecasting was issued on January 10, 2012, at 10:00 AM, for a moderate intermediate-depth earthquake in Vrancea, in a window of time of six days. A magnitude 4.3 earthquake was recorded ten hours later. This time the bio-location anomaly started in the same day with a geomagnetic anomaly.\n\nHowever, our data suggest such anomalies can be related to the resistivity anisotropy and magnetotelluric wave splitting (MWS) around crustal faults nearby and not to possible phenomena at the focal region, as previously reported. On the other hand, the resistivity anisotropy anomalies recorded around tectonic faults are possible related to stress variations in magnitude and direction observed before, during, and after moderate–large local and regional earthquakes. Finally, a valid earthquake prediction is not possible, but stress forecasting is able to offer some data before local and regional moderate and large earthquakes.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

A collection of optical anomalies which occurred prior to seismic activity will be presented. These include: this author's film pictures from the early 1980's that show reddish hue sky color changes prior to local earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area. A \"fire rainbow\" in Sichuan China that occurred just 30 minutes before the 2008, M7.8 earthquake. Flashes of light recorded on video in a clear sky prior to an earthquake swarm near the CA-OR border. An anomalous mirage seen from the air over the San Francisco Bay area the day after the Livermore 1980, M5.8 quake. Dramatic changes in the sky color in Sedona Arizona, prior to the April 4, 2010 Guadalupe Victoria Baja M7.2 quake (approximately 250 miles from Sedona). Subsequent similar sky color changes prior to major Baja aftershocks and other notable seismic activity. Various components of the optical spectrum will be explored as well as possible mechanisms for the aberrations.\n\nMarsha Adams is the President of the non-profit International Earthlight Alliance (IEA). IEA's goal is to make science more user-friendly through the study of anomalies. Originally trained in chemistry and biology she broadened her knowledge to geophysics and specializes in interdisciplinary research. In her 13 years in medical research, she has published several pioneering papers such as co-authoring a publication with Stanford's Norman Shumway that launched the popularity of coronary bypass surgery. She pioneered the concept that earthquakes could be forecast by monitoring extremely low frequency EM, and constructed the first civilian monitoring station to do so in the late 1970s. She was part of the Remote Viewing (RV) project at SRI International (where she also worked as a Sr. systems analyst) . She published two papers showing that RV results were influenced by the ambient geomagnetic field.\n\nMarsha Adams investigates influences of the measurable geophysical environment on biological processes. She has examined databases of tens of thousands of cases of biological data correlating them with solar-terrestrial activity. She goes on world wide expeditions to measure sacred sites, earthlight sites, effigy mounds, Mexican pyramids, geopathic zones, and even crop circles. She has assembled a geophysical observatory in Sedona, AZ to study earthlights and other anomalies that exist in the area.\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Dykstra","description":"Entomology textbooks report that a given insect smells an odorant when the odorant passes through tiny holes in the insect’s sensillae, latches on to an odorant binding protein, is transported across the sensillar lymph via diffusion, and then somehow binds with an odorant receptor on the dendritic membrane.\n\nIf obeying the laws of diffusion, the odorant cannot reach the dendritic membrane in time. Therefore, in an attempt to speed up the process, electrostatic attraction is brought forward as a new mechanism. After analysis of charges on the dendritic membrane (positive) as well as the charges on pheromone binding proteins (highly positive), electrostatic repulsion is instead determined to be occurring, further invalidating the textbook paradigm.\n\nResearch with frog oocytes (eggs) has revealed that odorants can activate (via ion flow) the oocyte, once insect odorant receptors are expressed in its plasma membrane. Activation definitely occurs, but binding has not been demonstrated, only assumed. Since binding is all but impossible in vivo, the question remains as to how the odorant activates the receptor in vivo, and in vitro, and if the mechanism is the same for each. Adding to the doubt, the binding sites on the odorant receptor have not been determined yet.\n\nResearch with liposomes has also revealed that odorants can activate the artificial membrane when insect odorant receptors are expressed in its membrane. However, this effect was also demonstrated with non-odorant receptor proteins where binding is not at all likely. If binding cannot reasonably occur, then maybe activation of the odorant receptor is occurring at a distance. If at a distance, then electromagnetics may be implicated.\n\nThe transfer of electromagnetic energy is assisted by certain media. An ionic solution can provide the necessary medium. All biological tissues contain ionic solutions. Not only does this include the insect sensilla, but the insect effectively protects this particular ionic solution from corruption via supporting cells and biological pumps. In addition to the usual salts found within living organisms, there is also the added charge benefit of the aforementioned binding proteins. Supporting evidence for charged media in arthropod sensillae comes from crustaceans, as well as from the frog oocytes and the liposome research mentioned above. In each case, activation either occurs with a charged medium, or increases in intensity with an increasingly charged medium.\n\nUnable to satisfy the current theory of insect olfaction using physical laws, and in light of the evidence brought forward by frog oocytes and liposomes, a new theory needs to be proposed. Support for an electromagnetic theory is presented from a wide variety of sources so that a cross disciplinary approach may enable olfactory scientists to investigate this process further.\n\nBio: Thomas Dykstra is owner of Dykstra Laboratories, Inc., based in Gainesville, FL, USA. The laboratory is devoted to research and development in the field of bioelectromagnetics (how electromagnetic fields influence life). Mr. Dykstra has consulted with engineers, agricultural scientists, academic institutions, government agencies, and private companies. He has traveled internationally to present lectures on diverse topics covering entomology, olfactory physiology, biophysics, paramagnetism, neurobiology, and antennae.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

This paper uses the term Sasquatch to represent the purported biological species and Bigfoot to represent the cultural phenomena. Bigfoot phenomena are sometimes hoaxed but hoaxing can be studied within social psychology. Nevertheless, Bigfoot phenomena are not all hoaxes. Bigfoot is also an archetype of the human collective unconscious and can be studied within psychoanalytic, neuroethological and phenomenological disciplines. Phenomenological or psychoanalytic research is historically discounted by zoology which also rejects Sasquatch as a species. Yet, Sasquatch is now considered a “de facto” species by a small but increasing number of scientists. \n\nI propose that the problem with Bigfoot/Sasquatch phenomena is lack of orthogonality within one discipline. The blurred boundaries between the social psychology of hoaxing, and the archetypal and biological areas of inquiry leave scholars feeling vulnerable or confused. As such, academics often refuse to peruse the existing anecdotal data and furthermore make irresponsible public statements that are verifiably false in assessing this area of scientific inquiry.\n\nThis paper reviews one such example of a false irresponsible public statement made by a scientist reporting on the status of current research on Sasquatch. This scientist stated unequivocally that no scientist to date has ever discovered scat or hair that might be from a Sasquatch. This paper seeks to use this erroneous public statement to reject the implied hypothesis that no scientist to date has ever found scat or hair that might be from a Sasquatch. \n\nThis writer is one such scientist, who has indeed found anomalous scat and hair as well as other anecdotal evidence supporting the possibility of Sasquatch. This paper presents photographic evidence of possible Sasquatch scat and hair previously submitted for lab examination that has not been found thus far to be another known species. I discuss submission of my hair samples to the newly developing Sasquatch DNA database and implications. Additionally, I provide other additional anecdotal photographic evidence in support of the possibility of Sasquatch and discuss other currently promising related research methodologies.\n\nSasquatch because of their similarity with humans, pose new and novel problems for research methodology and ethics. Sasquatch research may influence humans to consider new approaches in ecology and ethology. What are our implied human obligations about protection of the niche occupied by this purported species ? Can Sasquatch ethically refuse to participate in Sasquatch research? Certainly, science needs to reconsider the traditional appropriateness of harvesting a specimen if they appear to be hominid. Bigfoot/Sasquatch research may ultimately contribute to the shifting of some old paradigms of research, ethics and ways of knowing in the academic world.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

In the process, they disregard natural climate cycles that Earth has experienced during the past half million years, and insinuate human activity (especially carbon dioxide levels) is causing severe weather events that have never happened before.\n\nWe have all experienced severe weather, and can recall similar situations in the past. These are called climate cycles. A good example is the historical tornado outbreak killing nearly 1,000 people in the mid 1950s and again in 2011. There is also the historical Mississippi River Flood of 2011 and four other historical floods during the past 90 years. Generally speaking, droughts, blizzards, heat waves, major hurricane landfalls, major earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions continue to recur in well-defined cycles.\n\nGlobal Weather Oscillations Inc. (GWO) formed in 1991 with the specific understanding that weather and climate occurs in cycles. If you understand the natural mechanisms that control climate oscillations, you can predict climate cycles well into the future, but what about global warming? Is it caused or greatly exacerbated by human activity? Is carbon dioxide really a bad gas as suggested by the IPCC? Does it perpetuate warming and change Earth’s climate forever? Or, is it more likely that Earth is merely experiencing a natural global warming cycle, and the current high levels of carbon dioxide is just a natural cycle, even highly beneficial for photosynthesis and the resulting oxygen production?\n\nAll of these points will be discussed in light of mainstream research, as well as new climate cycle research by GWO and other research groups. Much of this information has not been disseminated to the general public by the media, Federal Government or the universities. Instead of snippets, Mr. Dilley’s presentation provides a step-by-step guide through Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse during the past half million years. We will examine nearly 2,200 cycles during the past half million years, including the interstadial warm cycles that occur approximately every 116,000 years, and the 10,000-year carbon dioxide cycle. The temperature cycles, carbon dioxide cycles, and natural mechanisms will all be tied together in order to provide a complete picture of Earth’s climate in the past, and into the future.\n\nBio: Mr. Dilley is a Meteorologist with over 40 years of climate/weather research and forecasting experience. He is CEO of Global Weather Oscillations Inc. (GWO). He is the author of the peer reviewed eBook Global Warming–Global Cooling, Natural Cause Found, and the booklet Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse. Mr. Dilley’s research isolated one of the main drivers of climate cycles, and he has incorporated these findings into climate forecasting models. The models forecast hurricane landfalls and the El Niño up to four years in advance, historical major earthquakes, and other earth/climate cycles. He is a member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), the National Weather Association (NWA), former Meteorologist with the National Weather Service, former Co-Host of the radio talk show “the Politically Incorrect Weather Guys,” and will be appearing in the documentary film “the Boy Who Cried Warming” to be released during the winter of 2012.

The actual experience of traveling in the time-space matrix has a dual implication: the impact on brain restructuration, and state of consciousness. The presentation explores the process of accessing non-local information to include research findings in neuroscience (brain plasticity) and quantum physics. Verbatim comments from CRV learners and operational viewers about their transformational experience will be presented.\n\nOver time, the CRV protocol creates a communications channel and a language between the conscious and the unconscious mind. By keeping the conscious busy with administrative type chores, the door of the unconscious is then free from interference and the viewer can travel into the time-space matrix and retrieve information. Freeing up the unconscious and expanding the aperture creates new experiences for the individual who will see and feel impressions from different time-space-event environments. It is to be expected that the viewer’s perceptions and reference points in life would then be affected.\n\nMany CRV learners report increased clarity in decision-making and assessing situations, as well as increased positive synchronicities in their lives, and an increase in intuitive insights. The CRV experience is different than lucid dreaming or time-traveling in an altered state. The controlled remote viewer is in a state of alertness and fully conscious while following the protocol of the session.\n\nDominique Surel holds a Doctoral degree in Organizational Leadership, and an MBA. While living in Paris and London, she worked for over 15 years as a consultant for global corporations in strategic positioning. She also trained in Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) to the Advanced Level with the original military viewer Lyn Buchanan. For over ten years her operational work has focused on business applications, police work, and personal development. She has been a professional radiesthésiste for over 15 years, and is a Professor at Energy Medicine University where she teaches CRV, Intuitive Intelligence, and Spiritual Leadership.

That is, prior to the time at which a decision is made regarding whether or not to observe a quantum phenomenon, the phenomenon's behavior is influenced such that it is in correspondence with the subsequent decision. Remote-viewing experiments have been conducted that parallel Wheeler's delayed-choice setup. In these experiments, remote-viewing sessions were conducted in a lengthy public demonstration of remote viewing using full scientific controls. Targets were chosen from a pool by a truly random and publicly known event after the remote-viewing sessions were conducted and the data made publicly available in encrypted format. Passwords to decrypt the remote- viewing data were made available online to the public only after the targets were assigned to all remote-viewing sessions, as determined by the publicly known random event. Thus, the target assignment process works by having a truly random process determine which target is assigned to each of the remote-viewing sessions, and this happens significantly after the times at which the remote-viewing sessions are conducted. While precognition is a frequently studied aspect of psi phenomena, this lengthy set of public experiments allows for the collection of a sizable body of data for each individual target using structured data-collection procedures under generally optimal viewing and experimental conditions. This enables a thorough objective and statistical comparison between the remote-viewing data and the target characteristics. The results of this set of experiments offer strong support for a quantum mechanism that mediates the remote-viewing experience, since no classical mechanism is known to be capable of replicating the phenomenon. This presentation proposes an explanatory linkage between the precognitive remote-viewing experience and Wheeler's delayed- choice experiment.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Psychokinesis is well established using humans to affect a random event generator (REG) output. If these concepts are combined, remote viewing can be carried out using human subjects unconsciously producing images via a local REG.\n\nExploitation of the capability to influence a completely automated REG output might allow for the further removal of the experimenter from the psi experiment. This may mitigate the psi “experimenter effect”, so long as the experiment is designed in such a way as to minimize the experimenter contact with the subject and the subject’s experimental data.\n\nAn experimental setup was developed that allowed for the combining of remote viewing and psychokinetic influence of REG outputs. The experiment consisted of two collections of data. In one case subjects were instructed to remote view hidden targets randomly selected by the subjects themselves while data were collected from a local REG device. The other consisted of psychokinesis data where the subjects were instructed to focus or concentrate on visible targets randomly selected by the subjects themselves while data were collected from a local REG.\nThe experiment employed a forced-choice protocol to simplify the judging of the experimentally produced data. A fixed set of targets was used and all machine-created images were judged against those fixed targets. In the judging procedure, the experimenters were given a set of possible targets, and ranked the targets from most like the machine-created image to least like it. There were always four decoys along with the target, giving a 20% hit rate by chance, over all trials.\n\nThis experiment was run in two separate groups. The first group, from a class experiment, had a total of 60 trials. producing a z-score of 2.33 for a p-value of 0.01 (1 tailed), and 0.02 (2 tailed). The second group, from an expanded follow-up experiment, had a total of 128 trials producing a z-score of 1.68 for a p-value of 0.05(1 tailed), and 0.09 (2 tailed). The first group of 60 trials showed statistically significant results while the second group of 128 trials only showed a 1 tailed significance.\n\nThe results provide evidence that remote viewing information can be captured with an inanimate system that samples noise. The first experiment was carried out in Edges of Science, a course on the science of psi at the University of Colorado.\n\nErik Maddocks is an RF Engineer with FIRST RF Corporation, where he designs antennas and antenna systems for the U.S. Department of Defense.

This has sometimes included viewing of extraterrestrial activity and UFOs. Some of the original military and SRI viewers, including Pat Price and Ingo Swann, viewed such subjects either for their own interest or, unofficially, for the U.S. Government. Many civilian viewers and groups, like the Farsight Institute, viewed the same phenomenon from many different perspectives. \n\nRecent RV activity has focused on more specific aspects of the phenomena like UFO crash retrievals. What do these RV sessions tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial presence. Is the data from such research scientific or accurate? Can it be verified? This talk will focus on showing what such remote sessions look like, what their defining characteristics are, whether we should trust such data, and what this information suggests about a possible extraterrestrial presence on Earth.\n\nDr. Simeon Hein has Ph.D. in sociology.

The photo was to be associated with the winner of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Researchers compared the remote viewers written transcripts to a set of four photos – two associated with to the Republican and Democratic frontrunners, one with a third party candidate option and one with an impossible option that served as the control group. A formal prediction was is- sued for a short period with some viewers being exposed to it and some not, in order to assess whether exposure to a potentially wrong prediction might result in displacement to the wrong photo. Other variables such as viewer preferences and voting behaviors were also assessed. Based on the suggestion to reject the null hypothesis during the hypothesis test summary a Wilcoxon test was conducted to assess the judge’s scoring value of viewer transcript across photos. The results indicated a significant difference. The mean of the ranks of Hilary (the popular vote front-runner) was 13.71, while the mean of the ranks in favor of Trump (the electoral vote front-runner) was 17.28. Results indicated that rather then describing the photo the remote viewers consciously saw at the future date, they instead tuned into photos they would never see. \n\nWhy did this happen? Is a large group consensus based approach really the best to\nuse in projects such as these? And what does this mean for the future of Associative Remote Viewing and other parapsychology projects that encounter similar incidents of displaced psi despite what seems to be a logical and theoretically sound design? A possible PK event that happened during the course of judging and issuing the prediction will also be discussed.\n\nBio: Debra Lynne Katz, M.S.W., is currently a Ph.D Student at University of West Georgia in the Psychology Department.

Kozyrev, an eminent Russian astrophysicist, gave proof of the unique possibility of researching the space without being constrained by the speed of light. According to his theory, cosmic consciousness of the human observer can instantly travel from one point of the Universe to another. To do this it is essential that a zone of energy time compaction be created around the observer. 50 years after the first human space flight (Yurii Gagarin, April 12th, 1961) we had to experimentally prove a different way of cosmic traveling in Kozyrev's space.\n\nThe first trial of energy-time compacting Kozyrev's mirrors was conducted 1990-1991 in the Far North - the region where, as Kozyrev assumed, time changes its direction allowing access to the future. It was shown that a laser ray sent from the mirrors and directed at the Moon can instantly transfer information to the Moon thus allowing hundreds of people on Earth to receive this information. The photograph of the Moon was one of the objects of the experiment conducted by ISRICA in Kozyrev's Mirrors June 19th, 2001. During the experiment several energy objects were recorded on film while revolving around the head of one of the participants (Kaznacheev V.P, Trofimov A.V., 2008).\n\nDuring the sun eclipse that took place on March 22, 2006, Kirlian photopolaroid device made a record of a cone of light with a coded matrix that contacted field structure of the operator in Kozyrev's Mirrors. At the time of the full solar eclipse in Novosibirsk on August 1, 2008 Doctor T.Kuznetsova laid out the specifics of a module that was replicated August 10, 2008 when using a cosmophysical hologram they managed to get digital photographs of certain photonic energy objects (possibly field forms of life) that are unknown to modern science. During the solar eclipse on June 22, 2009, with the use of a holographically altered water it was discovered that heart rates of the participants of the experiment who volunteered to observe the eclipse synchronized with each other. There were volunteers from Novosibirsk, Tashkent (Uzbekistan) and Beijing (China).\n\nResearchers from ISRICA were able to give on 2010 -11 years descriptions of moonscape and various objects on and under the surface of the Moon; the information about these objects is being constantly supplemented and systematized. These descriptions were obtained by ISRICA researchers within the framework of \"Remote Viewing\" method from the compacted energy- time zone in Kozyrev's mirrors. It seems that the promising new holographic mirror technology can be used to synchronically monitor near and deep space, various paleoastronomical objects on the Earth (according to N. A.

If there is any chance that the generally accepted model of reality— the regnant paradigm— is radically incomplete, or considerably distorted, or centered in the wrong spot (once again); or that the mortal veil may be permeable to some degree; or that there may be more to each of us than a brain doomed to rot inside its skull when one of its critical processes fails; or that we are not alone in a cosmic sense, or even in the ultimate sense— if there is any chance that any such hypothesis can be validated or falsified by empirical research beyond reasonable challenge, then what other research topic could promise a more potentially fruitful outcome? As Feynmann put it, “The thing that doesn’t fit is... the most interesting.”\n\nWhat keeps such phenomena— especially those that challenge the causal closure of physical reality and the limits of physical mortality— from being universally deemed among the most important research topics in the world can be accounted for in the way belief systems compete for predominance in the cultural ecology. When a religion is maximally successful, it becomes essentially transparent: “just the way things are”. Its unacknowledged presuppositions filter out beliefs that could challenge it, resulting in precisely the situation encountered in the contemporary attitude toward the study of anomalous phenomena.\n\nUsing an extension of meme theory, this presentation discloses the filters that work to keep science safely distant from the frontier where experiential anomalies pose their mysteries, and reveals how they operate to suppress challenges to the “transparent faith” that establishes and safe- guards the regnant paradigm. At first they seem beyond challenge—“just the way things are”—even insignificant. Yet they define the legitimate boundaries of science in the modern era and keep us confined there, forbidden to delve into the most magnificent mysteries. By examining the effects and challenging the validity of these filters, the way to that which is “the most interesting” opens before us.\n\nBio: James Clement van Pelt co-founded Yale’s Initiative in Religion, Science & Technology, coordinating its Working Group in Religious and Spiritual Perspectives on Bioethics for Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, the Synchro Project studying the experience of meaningful coincidence (synchronicity) and five international conferences at Yale engaging leading Western scientists, philosophers, anthropologists, and religious studies scholars.

Bauer","description":"Contemporary pronouncements by official agencies and by professional associations and their journals about matters of science, including issues of great public importance, have become significantly contrary to the actual facts on an increasing range of topics. This seems incredible in light of the historical successes of science which led to the widespread view of modern science as evidence-based and self-correcting. But that view fails to recognize the degree to which “science” has morphed from the vocation of a relatively small number of intellectual entrepreneurs to a vast enterprise driven by motives other than truth-seeking, enmeshed in a host of institutional as well as personal conflicts of interest. A vicious circle: Minority views are dismissed because “Science” is always trusted, thereby suppressing the evidence that “Science” is not always to be trusted. HIV/ AIDS is an outstanding illustration of officially accepted views persisting for decades despite being obviously contrary to fact.\n\nHenry Bauer is Emeritus Professor of Chemistry & Science Studies and Emeritus Dean of Arts & Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University (Virginia Tech).

Emmons","description":"What is the importance of subjective experience in the study of anomalous or “paranormal” phenomena? Although Greeley found that “the paranormal is normal,” or widely experienced even in American society, subjective experience is typically dismissed as “anecdotal evidence” in mainstream normal science. This rejection of the subjective is strongest in laboratory science that depends upon objective observation external to the experimenter. Thus the behavioral psychologist Watson could say in the 1920s that “there can be no such thing as consciousness.” With the revival of interest in consciousness due in part to modern neuroscience, we can still not observe consciousness objectively or even know whether it is located entirely in the brain. Indeed there are persistent reports suggesting that consciousness may be nonlocally connected to distant objects or intelligences. Studies of subjective experience in combination with neuroscience (as in lucid dreaming studies) may be a way to get beyond the impasse.\n\nHowever, researchers willing to admit subjective evidence of paranormal consciousness risk being labeled deviant scientists. Typically paranormal researchers have had their own anomalous experiences that motivate them to run the risk. Especially some anthropologists and other social scientists who have been trained in scientific methodologies for studying subjective human experience have contributed to an intellectual movement that is taking subjective paranormal experiences more seriously as ontological clues instead of merely bracketing them as cultural beliefs. Experiential source theory (vs. cultural source theory) is indicative of this approach. Abandoning the myth of scientific objectivity and exploring the insights provided by subjective experience can contribute to a holistic approach in the study of consciousness and of other scientific anomalies (e.g. UFO sightings) that have a human experiential component.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Respondents were also asked about the extent of their knowledge of each of these anomalies, and whether their opinions have been influenced by published work, personal experience, or presentation by a credible authority. Background questions included degree and area of advanced training, whether they are actively involved in conventional and anomalies research, and whether they regularly read our publications.\n\n349 respondents claimed to be current members, and 79 self reported themselves as former members, for a total of 428 usable responses. These response data are analyzed to determine the degrees of acceptance/rejection of the various anomalies and the predictors of opinion. These predictors supply the basis for understanding how individuals shift their interests towards anomalies, as well as providing suggestions for potentially increasing interest in anomalies research.\n\nBill Bengston is a professor of sociology at St. Joseph’s College in New York, and President of the SSE.

It portends progression toward a science that is beyond a hybrid of the objective and the subjective – a science of the Real. Real in the sense that an ultimate blending, or superposition of the two, could reveal a profoundly more accurate and comprehensive depiction, and result in a deeper understanding – of the true nature of Reality.\nProgress in this direction is evident in even some of the most traditional scientific institutions. In 2009, the British Royal Academy (sciences), in collaboration with the British Academy (humanities) stated: “Extraordinary talent remains one of the big unexplained puzzles, which will only be solved by a true collaboration between sciences and humanities”. A much earlier version of incorporating the subjective in objective scientific research of extraordinary or unusual human abilities led to the field of mind/body medicine. Jon Kabat-Zinn, a preeminent pioneer in mind/body medicine, went even a step further in refining the subjective aspect by hiring only researchers who had an established meditation practice. Researchers’ prior subjective experiences, of the same type as their subjects were having, combined with the type of personal development achieved as a result of these experiences, was an invaluable asset – as they studied their subjects’ progress with both objective and subjective research methodologies.\n\nEastern science traditions encourage such subjective internal developmental work as a means to promoting both a scientist’s own evolutionary development, and their concomitant ability to understand research conundrums from a higher perspective. This is of particular importance for studying unusual or unexplained phenomena. Along these same lines, Einstein noted that a problem cannot be solved at the level at which it was created. Eminent scientists from east and west would appear to agree that these phenomena are best studied not simply from an intellectual or mental level of consciousness, but rather from a level of spontaneous apprehension, or intuition – the state from which ‘Einstein “A-HA” moments’ originate.\n\nThis talk incorporates both eastern and western science perspectives, in addressing objective/subjective research design in studying anomalies. Drawing from Eastern science traditions, including Kashmir Shaivism and Patanjali Yoga Sutras, the main focus is the nature of the researcher’s subjective personal evolutionary development.\n\nDr. Syldona’s interdisciplinary background encompasses science, engineering, psychology, education and Eastern psychospiritual traditions, at institutions including: Carnegie-Mellon, Stanford and Brown Universities and SUNY Stonybrook. She is Founder/Director of the Institute for Human Psychospiritual Development, in Colorado.\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Under even the most rigorous protocols, they are only irregularly replicable, and they appear to be insensitive to most basic physical coordinates, including distance and time. Rather, their strongest correlations are with various subjective parameters, such as intention, emotional resonance, uncertainty, attitude, and meaning, and information processing at an unconscious level appears to be involved. If science, by its most basic definition, is to pursue understanding and utilization of these extraordinary processes, it will need to expand its current paradigm to acknowledge and codify a proactive role for the mind in the establishment of physical events, and to accommodate the spectrum of empirically indicated subjective correlates. The challenges of quantitative measurement and theoretical conceptualization within such a ‘‘Science of the Subjective’’ are formidable, but its potential intellectual and cultural benefits could be immense, not least of all in improving the reach, the utility, the attitude, and the image of science itself.\n\nRobert G.

John Caffey, who wrote the first textbook on pediatric readiology, was the pioneer in bring \"multiple unsuspected traumata\" into the medical corpus. But he was a very reluctant pioneer, and did not connect all the dots between the injuries to children (brain hematomas, greenstick fractures in the arms and legs) and the dynamics of the family. \n\nPediatricians mostly did not believe that parents for other caregivers would inflict injuries on the children, even though evidence was abundant that it was happening. Into this vacuum stepped Henry Kempe, charismatic pediatrician, with a background in public health, and a determination to do something about the problem. Developing interdisciplinary teams that included both physicians and social workers, Kempe used a dramatic public presentation to put child abuse (\"the battered child syndrome\") on the medical agenda. Within a decade, child abuse and neglect went from a stage of \"uncorrelated observations\" to controversy and finally public acceptance.\n\nIn considering this case, we can see that often scientists are not themselves aware of the dynamics of science, and often erroneously think that if certain events were occurring, \"they would be the first to know.\" We can show, by contrast, that they are often the last to know, and fail to consider how their own attitudes might prevent knowledge from accumulating. Furthermore the case study underlines the processes that allow awareness to take place, including in this instance the ability to do something constructive to solve the problem. Other anomalies may well share similar dynamics, so it is important for our approach to anomalistics to take into account how anomalies reach public awareness, often in \"unscientific\" ways.\n\nRon Westrum is emeritus professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University, where his specialty has been the dynamics of science and technology. He also is adjunct professor of \"society and risk\" at the University of Stavanger, Norway.

Science changed from an elite avocation into a mass activity, from innovative and ground-breaking to overwhelmingly mediocre, and from highly trustworthy to highly unreliable.\n\nScience became highly reliable as conservative peers resisted novel claims, insisting on strong evidence before abandoning earlier theories; but in the latter half of the 20th century, such relatively healthy resistance to unorthodox claims morphed into active suppression of minority views in science. Dogmatic insistence on wrong theories that are the basis for public policies has brought colossal damage.\n\nA fuller discussion than I can give here is in my new book, Dogmatism in Science & Medicine: How Dominant Theories Monopolize Research and Stifle the Search for Truth (McFarland, 2011, in publication).\n\nHenry Bauer is Professor Emeritus of Chemistry & Science Studies and Dean Emeritus of Arts & Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University (Virginia Tech).

Further, there is no consensus explanation from the various widely differing theoretical attempts to explain it. Given the strong fit between the orthodox (Copenhagen) framework and the data, as well as the absence of anomalies, some have expressed pessimism that this issue can be resolved. However, I will argue that there is a set of anomalous data that can be exploited to make progress: psi data.\n\nSome interpretations such as Wigner (1967) suggest that consciousness plays a role in determining the outcome of quantum events. Most physicists have strongly resisted such explanations, which imply some type of mind-matter interaction. For a number of reasons, I will argue that this resistance is mistaken. First, while most scientists embrace the idea that consciousness is solely a product of brain processes, there is currently no consensus theory on how consciousness emerges. In fact, consciousness is not congruent within classical theories of physics at all. Second, the alternative attempts to explain quantum mechanics—which include parallel universes or quantum superposition—do not appear any less radical than the existence of mind-matter interaction. Third, and perhaps most important, there is substantial data that imply the existence of mind-matter links, as well as other psi data that suggest non-local connections between minds.\n\nA brief review of the literature demonstrates strong evidence for psi in a number of different categories. There is also substantial evidence in telekinesis or mind-matter interaction experiments, some of which test mental intentions on random number generators based in quantum mechanical processes. While there appears to be a replication issue, differing test results may be accounted for through experimenter effects. This likelihood appears stronger given the evidence from large-scale mind-matter experiments such as the Global Coherence Project, which arguably reduces the importance of experimenter effects.\n\nWhat can the psi data suggest about alternate explanations of quantum mechanics? First, the evidence from telekinesis or mind-matter experiments suggests that that minds can influence the intrinsic probabilities underlying physical processes. This casts serious doubt on the Everett or many worlds theory, where all possible worlds suggested from the quantum framework exist simultaneously. Second, waveform collapse theories that do not involve consciousness also appear to be inconsistent with the psi data. Most categories of psi appear to be consistent with two classes of explanations: 1) waveform collapse theories that involve consciousness and 2) theories that suggest a deeper underlying stratum of reality, such as Bohm and Hiley (1993). However, the experimental evidence from the Global Coherence Project, which suggests shifts in the emotions of large groups can influence random processes, is arguably inconsistent with waveform collapse theories, which require a conscious observer. Thus the overall psi evidence favors some versions of the frameworks explored by Bohm and Hiley’s (1993) as well as some work by Stapp (2011).\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The famous American philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996) focused on scientific theories as the crux of scientific endeavor, and argued that persistent anomalies observed in science episodically lead to “paradigm shifts” and to “scientific revolutions,” thus revealing the discontinuity of scientific change—without necessarily implying scientific progress. The study of anomalous phenomena, or more simply expressed, of anomalies in science, which are key elements of Kuhn’s approach, has received increasing attention in the last twenty years, in particular by researchers who question the paradigmatic nature of scientific endeavor.\n\nOther less well-known philosophers of science adopted a different approach to scientific change and progress: in France, Gaston Bachelard (1884–1962) addressed the issue from an epistemological viewpoint, involving concepts instead of theories and paradigms. Bachelard notably invoked scientific progress as coincidental with scientific change—which is not necessarily the case in Kuhn's work, owing to so-called “Kuhn loss”—with at its heart the notions of epistemological: “obstacle,” “break” or “rupture,” and “reforging.” In Japan, Mitsuo Taketani (1911–2000) characterized scientific change, by analogy with Hegelian dialectics, as a process involving three distinct stages of scientific development: the phenomenal, substantial, and essential stages, with the last stage unifying the previous two stages. The process is cyclic and proceeds in a hierarchical spiral.\n\nTo our knowledge, in modern philosophy of science, no in-depth comparative analysis of scientific change and progress has been attempted that contrasts differing approaches, such as that of Kuhn in the United States, with the work of less well-known philosophers of science such as Bachelard in France and Taketani in Japan.\n\nThe goal of a new research project which we are initiating at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology is thus to address the three following research questions (RQ):\nRQ1: Can different approaches to scientific change and progress adopted so far in modern philosophy of science be integrated into a more general model, and if so, how?\nRQ2: How can anomalies in science be characterized, and how can anomalies, as a key element of scientific change and progress, be incorporated into the more general model considered in RQ1?\nRQ3: How can the results of this research project be applied as a useful intellectual tool by researchers and graduate students in their daily research activities, to contribute to increasing their critical approach to and improving the originality of their research (whether individually or in teams), in particular in terms of how to formulate research problems—which are by definition ill-structured—of the research methodology that is used, and of the interpretation of experimental results, while keeping in mind the possibility of the appearance of genuine anomalies?\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, Roger Nelson, and Sandy Wiener.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The topic for the contest was: Wandering Towards a Goal: How can mind- less mathematical laws give rise to aims and intention? The Community Ranking Process has been concluded and Mr. Gantz’ essay is ranked 5th out of 229 essays submitted.\n\nOver the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in explaining how complex, intelligent behaviors emerge in dynamic systems. The overall architecture can now be discerned, although much work remains to be done on the particulars. At the same time, the question of why the universe works this way remains as elusive as ever. There is a direction to the process, and we do not understand the nature of that intentionality. We are left with contradictory hypotheses for why the universe is the way it is. Do you believe that what exists is fundamentally an expression of randomness within mathematical forms? Or do you believe in a cosmic intentionality that provides generative guidance for the emergence and evolution of our uniquely specified universe? This question is, and always will be, from an empirical standpoint, undecidable. Yet our choice of answer is fundamental to how we think about the world and how we live in it. I make the argument for cosmic intentionality as a rational, evidence-based and comprehensive hypothesis for explaining why the world is the way it is, and point to the advantages of this hypothesis in enhancing our understanding of life.\n\nThat cosmic intentionality is characterized by intention, attraction, cooperation and reciprocity across and within the emergent levels. These attributes are the defining features of love. In summary, cosmic intentionality is love flowing through the universe, guiding the emergent cascade.\n\nBio: George Gantz is a writer, philosopher and retired business executive with a life-long passion for mathematics, science, philosophy and theology.

Two phenomenologists, G.W.F. Hegel and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, wrote fairly extensively on the paranormal. Moreover, their having done so is not at all incidental to the basic character of the phenomenological method. The latter involves a bracketing of specific theoretical knowledge and a suspension of commitment to potentially conflicting frameworks for the acquisition of such knowledge. This is done not only with a view to understanding the cultural-historical construction of such frameworks, but with the aim of delineating basic structures of our experience, perception, and understanding that are more fundamental and stable than any particular scientific theories or their broader paradigmatic structures. Consequently, Colonel Alexander’s use of the term “phenomenology” is apt. This adoption of the discourse of “phenomenology” should\nbe generalized within the field of exploratory scientific research on the paranormal, but in a way that explicitly acknowledges, appropriates, and furthers the insights of thinkers such as Hegel and Merleau-Ponty.\n\nTo this end, I intend to examine the most significant point of contention between Hegel and Merleau-Ponty on the question of the implications of paranormal phenomena for the enterprise of scientific exploration in general. Hegel views psychic phenomena and uncanny abilities as a holdover from pre-rational, and predominately unconscious, human cognitive functioning. \n\nNevertheless, pretending that such paranormal phenomena are merely hallucinations or delusions is unscientific and, in Hegel’s view, the progressive and phased evolution of human understanding toward the perfection of Science qua “Absolute Knowing” with its attendant utopian sociopolitical implications, cannot come about until and unless there is a scientific recognition and contextualization of these increasingly anomalous phenomena.\n\nBy contrast, Merleau-Ponty looks at scientific research against the backdrop of an inherently irrational life-world that is “wild” in nature before being tamed by any culturally and historically conditioned system of belief and practice. Paranormal phenomena, or what Merleau-Ponty calls “bastard and untameable experiences”, can never be objectively comprehended by scientific theorization. Consequently, Science does not afford us a mirror of objectively existent structures in Nature and the form of subjectivity characteristic of the theoretical observer of the cosmos is itself a god-like archetypal projection, similar to the totems of less sophisticated tribal societies but infinitely more powerful in its world-conquering and world-forming capacity.\n\nBio: Jason Reza Jorjani, PhD is an Iranian-American and native New Yorker of Persian and northern European descent.

Alexander","description":"There are signals that can be detected or transmitted by human practitioners of remote viewing, dowsing, remote healing and other psi fields. That those signals exist, and can be detected or transmitted, is a basic premise under which psi operates. Those signals can transmit information about places, events, or other conditions that are determined to be objective targets. Scientific experiments demonstrate psi influence as statistically significant effect replicable over time.\n\nMany counter-advocates deny the possibility that psi signals exist despite a considerable body of evidence that has been amassed. More perplexing is that some of these signals seem to violate existing notions of time and allow for both precognition and retrocognition. However the strength of those signals and effects, when compared to other information/effects, is often referred to as noise, a description of the information background environment. In fact, the “signal-to-noise ratio” is commonly used to address these issues in all signals analysis.\n\nThroughout history psychics have made claims about their efforts in obtaining accurate information. Traditionally, they focus on extraordinary success stories supported by anecdotal evidence. Rarely acknowledged are the dramatic claims and predictions that are demonstrably wrong. In reality, such claims are seriously damaging the credibility of the entire field while clearly providing the legitimate skeptics with viable ammunition with which to attack the basic validity of all research in phenomenology.\n\nMedia attention often focuses on fast-breaking dramatic stories and pays little attention to fact checking. In their venue, the entertainment value outweighs the facts or real newsworthiness of the event. Concocted stories often are reported as if true and such events taint public perception of credible research.\n\nTherefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the endemic signal to noise issues attendant to all psi research. Efforts are needed to enhance weak signals while decreasing background noise. If we are to attain appropriate status in scientific disciplines, the researchers must be prepared to address both positive and negative outcomes as well as their relevancy to the public.\n\nBio: John B.

In both labs, experiments were conducted in vitro, comparing the growth of cancer cells in standard growth media and in the same media infused with subtle energy patterns developed using Vital Force Technology. Both labs were treated twice a day by spraying water infused with the energy pattern “Clean Sweep” to ensure an energetically clean environment.\n\nThe ratio of dead cells to live cells was determined utilizing DNA-labeling dyes and Flow Cytometry analysis. Experiments at the PR Lab showed necrosis cell death of pancreatic cancer cells doubled over a two-week period from 9% in the control to 18% in the energy-infused media. When cancer cells were treated with the VFT energy pattern in addition to the anti-cancer drug Gemcitabine, the increase in cell death went from 15% in the control to 36% in the energy-infused media.\n\nAnother pilot experiment was conducted in the PR Lab on mice with cancer. The mice were injected with a saline solution infused with the same VFT energetic pattern that was used for the in vitro experiment. After three weeks the total tumor volume in the treated mice was 57% less than the total tumor volume of the control group. The number of tumors per mouse was decreased by 32%.\n\nExperiments in the CCSD lab were conducted using the Breast Cancer cell line MDA231 and the Acute Monocytic Leukemia cell line THP-1 growing in standard media RPMI-1640. After 14 days the control had 9 million cancer cells while the cells grown in the subtle energy–infused media had a total of 500,000 cells—18 times less than in the control, and 60% of these cells were dead. Therefore, less than 3% of the cancer cells were alive in the energy-infused media in comparison with the control.\n\nThese results suggest an intriguing opportunity to develop a cancer suppression treatment using subtle energy infused media. It can be done either by designing additives to existing and future anti-cancer medicine or as a component in cancer prevention and supplements.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Norman Hansen","description":"A Torsional Pendulum That Detects and Measures What May Be a Form of Bioenergy\nJ. Norman Hansen\nProfessor of Biochemistry, Emeritus\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nUniversity of Maryland\nCollege Park, Maryland USA\n\nMany people believe that humans and other living organisms produce fields of bioenergy that permeate and extend beyond the periphery of these organisms. Scientific experiments designed to detect these biofields have consistently failed, so the concept of bioenergy has no scientific credibility. The idea in this experimental approach is that the devices used to detect these fields may be inappropriate in that they typically detect some type of photon energy. If biofields do not consist of components of the electromagnetic spectrum, a different type of detector should be employed. These experiments employ a detector that is designed to detect a physical “pushing” force instead of being a detector of photons. The detector used here is a simple torsional pendulum that is suspended above the subject. The experimental design includes a video camera connected to a computer that can detect and measure the pendulum movements with high precision, and store this information into a data file for later analysis.\n\nExperiments show that the pendulum detects and measures substantial forces which drastically alter the motions of the pendulum when a subject is seated under it. The following effects are consistently observed with every subject in every experiment performed up to now.\n\n1. Substantial shifts of the center of oscillation of the pendulum; shifts as large as 2.2 cm\n(7 deg) requiring a force that is equivalent to 45 mg, are observed. \n2. Many new frequencies of oscillation of the pendulum are introduced when a subject is present. 3. Dramatic changes in the amplitudes of oscillation of the pendulum are observed throughout the experiment: increasing, decreasing, and increasing again, in quasi-consistent patterns. \n4. These shifts of the center of oscillation, the new frequencies of oscillation, and the changes in amplitudes all persist for 30–60 min after the subject has left the pendulum. This is inconsistent with the physics of a simple harmonic oscillator such as a torsional pendulum, which should return to simple harmonic oscillation immediately after any exterior disturbances are discontinued.\n\nIt is important that the effects on the pendulum are substantial, so one does not need statistical analysis to demonstrate that these effects have occurred, because they are obvious upon inspection of the data.\n\nAfter conducting control experiments, especially with respect to the possible effects of subject- generated air currents on the pendulum, it is concluded that the effects are exerted by some kind of force field that is generated by the subject seated under the pendulum. We know of no force, such as one within the electromagnetic spectrum, which can account for these results. The idea that a previously unknown force is responsible is difficult to accept. It is therefore expected that a conventional explanation will be discovered, but it is difficult to identify a conventional force that can explain these results. It is important that other investigators repeat and confirm these observations.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

The mix of these energies varies in each person and differentiates the health of one person from another (Palep, 2004, p. 54). This three-energy interactive model of a holistic human being was discovered thousands of years ago by many saint- and sage-scientists in India. Palep (2004) has explained the scientific foundation of Ayurveda—an ancient Indian system of holistic health and healing. Tamini (1961) has given a thorough commentary on the ancient science of Yoga including Ayurveda. Our objective is to combine concepts from both ancient and modern sciences and give preliminary results that demonstrate the effect of thought transactions on body cells.\n\nWaechter (2002) reviewed extensive literature and hypothesized that the concept Qi energy in the ancient Chinese system of holistic healing is closely related to bioelectromagnetic (BioEM) energy in Western science. Emoto (2005) showed that directed positive thoughts created well- defined crystalline structures in water and negative thoughts created ill-defined structures. Letchoumanane and Gupta (2012) hypothesized that BioEM energy is projected through thoughts, and demonstrated its effect on doubling okra yield.\n\nOur hypothesis is that directing thoughts towards a particular organ, tissue, or group of cells can also change behavior. Human liver and cancer cells and Rat Neurons are considered for the experiments. These cells are separated into two sets: The first set serves as the control against which results are compared using thought transactions. The cells are diagnosed using optical microscopy and impedance spectroscopy (Prodan, 1999). The first set of results from this experiment in progress will be presented.\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive quantitative framework combining ancient sciences with modern science for understanding the dynamics of thoughts and regulation of genes in the cells. The success of this research may one day stop the growth of cancer cells and address other major diseases using non-invasive thought-based treatments.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Dept. of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Latvia\n2. Beech Tree Labs, Providence, \n3. Energy Tools International, Eagle Point, OR\n\nAn in-vitro experiment with human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells was conducted to compare the influences of various subtle energy patterns, created with Vital Force Technology, on cells’ viability and longevity while in the condition of “food deprivation.” To create this condition, a growth medium was not replenished throughout the entire course of the experiment. That is, at first, cells grew normally, but once the food ran out, they began to die. Control cells were grown in a standard growth medium, while the experimental cells were grown in the same medium, but infused with different subtle energy patterns. The growth rate of cells grown in energy-infused media was dramatically higher during the growth stage, up to 82% more than in the control group. The best result was demonstrated by the subtle energy pattern that was created specifically for the support of cells’ functioning. Also, cells in energy-infused media died much more slowly than the control cells: on the 9th day, there were between 50% - 83% more live cells in the energy-infused medium.\nAnother series of experiments was conducted using the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293). To create a food deprivation condition cells were grown in a standard growth medium without the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS), which is usually used for growing cells. In addition to the absence of FBS, mitochondrial toxins - MMP+, causing symptoms of Parkinson disease, or Rotenone - were added to the experimental samples and half of the control samples. Growth media of the experimental samples were infused with the two subtle energy patterns that produced the best results in the first experiment (described above). After 3 days, the viability of the cells and the mitochondrial membrane potential were compared, using the MMT colorimetric assay, JC-1 dye, and Tecan spectrometer. Measurements showed that both the viability and mitochondrial membrane potential of the experimental cells were significantly better, not only in comparison with the control containing mitochondrial poison, but even in comparison with the non-poisoned control.\n\nPresented experimental results show that subtle energy patterns technologically created to support human cells can effectively provide high viability of cells and protect their mitochondrial functions, even in the presence of poisonous substances.\n\n---\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

In addition to chemical information storage utilized in homeopathy (Thomas, 2007), EM fields can also be imprinted into water (Rein, 1992; Smith, 2004). EM information storage has been used as a mechanism to explain how EM fields influence biological systems, since direct experimental data indicates EM- treated water can produce biological effects weeks long after the source has been removed (Fesenko, 1995).\n\nSimilar experiments are reported here using a healing-arts practitioner as the source of bio-energy. Human lymphocytes were used as the biological target in these experiments. Lymphocytes were partially purified from freshly drawn human blood obtained from a local blood bank. Lymphocytes were fed with commercial tissue culture medium and maintained in a typical CO2 incubator. Lymphocyte proliferation was measured 24hr after incubating cultures with radio-labeled thymidine (which is incorporated into DNA).\n\nData presented here demonstrate that Dr. Leonard Laskow could imprint water (in tissue culture medium) with different intentions. Tissue culture medium treated with a stimulating intention produced a marked increase in cell proliferation when added to cultured lymphocytes. A decrease in cell proliferation was observed when the intention was to reduce the number of cells. The magnitude of these effects was between 25 and 40% relatively to untreated controls. Statistical significance was reached at the 0.01 level. The results indicate that specific conscious intentions can produce polarity-specific biological effects and that this information can be stored in water for weeks.\n\nReferences:\nAhn J. “Information storage and retrieval through quantum phase.” Science. 2000; 287:463-5.\nFesenko, EE et al “Preliminary microwave irradiation of water solutions changes their channel-modifying activity”.

A hint about the answer to this question can be found in experiments which report changes in RDR under the influence of Subtle Energy/Chi transmitted by a human being.\n\nThese experiments demonstrate that the force of SE/Chi can alter the action of one of the four fundamental forces of the Universe, the “Weak Force” (WF). According to the Electro-Weak theory, the WF and Electromagnetic Force have the same roots. This raises another fundamental question: Is it possible that SE can also alter the EM field?\n\nThe experiments presented in our report demonstrate that the energy of the EM field present in the area surrounding a small disk of man-made quartz was diminished by more than 34% when the quartz disk was “infused” with a specific SE pattern generated by Vital Force Technology. Conclusion: Subtle Energy is one of the fundamental forces of the Universe and can affect the action of the whole Electro-Weak Force.\n\nThis result calls for more experiments to attempt to change the RDR using various technologically generated Subtle Energy patterns. The fact that only certain patterns of SE affect the EM field indicates that the action of SE greatly depends on the information encoded in a particular energy pattern. This phenomenon was also observed in our experiments reported in Society for Scientific Exploration – 27th Annual Meeting, 2008.\n\nJoie Jones, PhD - Joie Jones received the BA and MA degrees from the University of Texas at Austin (1963 & 1965) and the PhD degree in physics from Brown University (1970).

The microtubules on cell membranes may serve as antennae that both read and broadcast these waves.\n\nMcKusick has found that traumatic memories exist as “pathological oscillations” within this field, and that a simple tuning fork can be used to both locate and modulate these frequency patterns, leading to the immediate and often profound resolution of a wide variety of symptoms. McKusick has taught this method to hundreds of students who are able to use this map to produce the same kind of outcomes in their clients. Essentially the process seems to reduce the “noise in the signal” of the acoustic and electromagnetic systems of the body.\n\nThis notion, that what we call “mind” may exist in a bioplasmic bubble that surrounds our body like our own personal cloud of memory storage is a radical claim. In an attempt to create a framework for this hypothesis, McKu-sick has brought together frontier Biofield Science, Electric Universe Theory and esoteric tradition to form an intriguing and revolutionary perspective on mind, memory, and cosmology. Additionally, she has partnered with a team of scientists to apply the scientific method to the hypothesis and is currently engaged in this research study, which will be submitted for peer review upon completion.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration conference at Yale University, 2017\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

Kenneth Arnette","description":"Energy Medicine and the Chakras: Shedding Scientific Light on an Ancient Paradigm\nJ. Kenneth Arnette\n\nChinese medicine is an ancient medical art based on the concept of qi, or vital life energy, and its role in the health of the body. Essentially, disease is seen as an imbalance of qi, and treatment of disease is accomplished through methods that re-balance this energy. Examples of these treatments include acupuncture, herbs, Reiki and related methods such as Healing Touch, cupping, and many other approaches.\n\nIn the theory of Chinese medicine, chakras play a vital role. These entities are seen as energy centers in the body, and energy-balancing methods focus on these centers. But from a Western perspective, chakras are poorly understood, if at all. I propose a new, scientific way of understanding these ancient ideas, based on known classical physics (electromagnetism) as well as recent theoretical developments in physics (string theory). I will present a dualistic model in which the human being is composed of two parts, a physical body that generates an oscillating electromagnetic field (EMF), and a non-material entity (“essence”) that also generates an oscillating EMF. That is, while the essence is not composed of matter, it is made of a substance that has the “physical” property of generating an EMF. For the purpose of model construction, the body and essence can be seen as two oscillating dipoles interacting via their EMFs. These two fields interact via constructive interference, producing an interference pattern (similar to a double-slit experiment) that manifests as alternating nodes and crests along the spinal cord. The strength of this interaction and thus the interference pattern is a function of the match (or mismatch) of the oscillation frequencies of the two EMFs: when the two fields oscillate in phase, the interaction is maximized and optimal health can be realized; as the oscillating dipoles lose phase coherence, the interaction strength decreases and the body’s health can suffer as a result.\n\nI hypothesize that Chinese and energy medicine treatments have their basis in adjusting these oscillation frequencies to re-establish phase coherence and strengthen the interaction between body and essence, leading to health improvement. Unfortunately, physics is incapable of addressing a system in which one dipole is not material, and overlaps with a dipole that is material. I therefore will present a simplified model that will demonstrate the properties I have described through a straightforward qualitative analysis.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

One well-known such established technique is Ayurveda - an Ancient Medical Science and Technology that has been practiced in India for more than 3000 years and still remains part of the mainstream medicine for over 60 per cent of the population in the country. Ayurveda is slowly expanding all over the world as a complementary/alternative approach to modern medicine. Today a number of research articles on Ayurveda are out there published in the main stream medical journals as well as explicit alternative medical journals devoted exclusively to Ayurveda and also other medical technologies of ancient India. However, none of these published works so far uncovers the paradigm dimension of Ayurveda, rather they often viewed Ayurveda under the lens of mainstream medical system; characterization and analysis were carried out without valuing it for its own authenticity. It has to be understood that unlike traditional medicine as it is practiced today Ayurveda has always possessed a personalized medicine approach. Personalized medicine is indeed a growing field of interest in modern medicine system in recent years. From a modern science perspective the fundamentals of Ayurveda cannot be explained on a cellular level using current nanotechnology because of the very nature of its axiomatic construct, though the indirect efficacy of some of the Ayurvedic components can be obtained in labs to a certain extent. However, a classical approach from a physics perspective on the fundamental using atomic and molecular transitions states can be carried out as an analogous study without breaking the authenticity and originality of the Ayurvedic axioms. By carrying out such an study a need for the step to characterize and analyze the effects of treatment using a modern medical approach can be eliminated, albeit the fundamentals reasons that cause the symptoms of certain disease can be understood using modern equivalent terms in physics without breaking the its validity. Here a novel yet ancient approach using mathematical equations and analysis will be presented. The role of energy levels transitions using the fundamentals of physics concept will be incorporated to classically explain the underlying scientific phenomena that lay as the basis for the identified symptomatic disease. This approach is called as the Veda-model. An extensive literature review is carried out on ancient Indian texts to substantiate this model in order to break the unsolved mysteries of Ayurveda that remained dormant for several centuries.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

This system measures the ultraweak light emission from humans and other organisms either alone or during human interaction. Our experiments show that various regions of the human body, including the palm of the hand, forehead, heart, and abdominal regions, emit photons in the visible spectrum at an extremely low rate (less than 100 counts per min), in line with published values. We measured the light emitted from mind-body practitioners of qigong, meditation, yoga, and various types of energy healing, such as Reiki, external qi, and other forms, who offer energy therapy to clients. In some cases, these energy practitioners were able to alter their own energy emission dramatically, for example by “opening” and “closing” the “third eye” region. In other experiments, we examined the light emission before, during, and after energy therapy sessions with both patients and practitioners in the chamber. The results of 8 such sessions show that each energy therapy session was unique in terms of the pattern of light emission. Moreover, light emission diminished in all subjects after energy therapy.\n\nIn another study, we examined 3 patients pre-post energy therapy that was conducted by an energy practitioner outside of the photon counting chamber. We found that the photon count rate from the patients’ forehead, heart, and abdominal regions became more balanced immediately post-therapy.\n\nIn a study comparing cucumbers grown by several different agricultural methods, we found that organically grown cucumbers emitted considerably less light than commercially grown ones. Moreover, sweeter, more pleasant-tasting cucumbers emitted much less light than bitter or tasteless ones.\n\nThis ultraweak light emitted from organisms, which has been called “biophoton emission” by those who hypothesize that it is bio-informational, bio-regulatory, and not just a waste product of metabolism, may provide insight into extraordinary states of health and healing in the case of humans. In foodstuff, it may be provide information on freshness and plant stress. The biofield hypothesis, which views life from an energy field viewpoint in which energy-with-information is key to the state of an organism’s physiology and regulation, will be offered as an explanatory model.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to support our commitment to open access scientific research?

One such source is harmful radiation from electromagnetic fields (EMF) all around us. Then there are the toxins in the air and water, pesticides and antibiotics in foods, and the microbes in the air and the environment. All of the negative components of the environment have the potential to cause a wide spectrum of diseases. BioGeometry is a science which offers a possible solution.\n\nDr. Ibrahim Karim, founder of BioGeometry, built upon the work of French radiesthesia scientists and found the energies which contribute to health in biological beings. He defines BioGeometry as “the science of establishing harmony between biological fields and their environment, through the use of design, language of color, form, motion and sound.” We are all receptors of the “quality of physics” from an energetic perspective — we see electromagnetic radiation in the range of 400 to 700 nanometers and call this color; we hear compression of air waves and call this sound; we feel with our skin via sensors that transmit signals to our brain; the same can be said of all of our primary senses. Sound and color and all energies are related through resonance. Dr. Karim discovered that harmonics of three energies, called BG3, were beneficial to health of humans, animals, and plants. He discovered ways to create these energies and studied the beneficial effects of the energies on diseases such as hepatitis, reversing EMF sensitivity, growing plants without pesticides, and raising chickens without use of antibiotics.

There are many ways to generate such energy: e.g. Pyramids, Orgonite (metal particles set in resin), non-Hertzian fields, and Ormus — the “White Gold” of David Hudson. I have developed a reliable quantitative dowsing method, based on measuring the radius of the innermost dowsable ring from the source. In this way I have compared the intensity of a variety of such sources under various conditions. Some important findings have received objective back-up from both UV spectroscopy of charged water and statistically controlled seedling growth experiments.\n\nPrincipal findings include:\n— Macroscopic quantum entanglement between identical images on paper, allowed a dowsable influence to be received from even across the Atlantic. — Information (in the form of a number of frequencies) was also sent non-locally in this way.\n— Where orgone, or life-energy, is a “syntropic” influence, promoting increased order, I have identified an “entropic” influence, which both discharges charged water, and inhibits seeding growth.\n— Studies with ormus have revealed it can be made to quantum tunnel through glass.\n\nIt is proposed that this “life-energy” is an influence conducive to coherence in the zero-point energy, and thus to syntropic processes in the local material environment. Living organisms and water are particularly susceptible to such an influence. The ability of such a field to carry information suggests that it may be critical for the effectiveness of radionics.\n\nIt is concluded that methods for producing syntropic fields could play a critical part in healing our world, not only (1) By local syntropic effects — e.g. the Russian pyramids, and the effects of Ormus on health of humans, animals and plants, but (2) With the use of entanglement via images, to enhance remote human intention — for example by further empowering the effects of group meditations for peace.\n\nRoger Taylor has done research in fundamental immunology at NIMR, London.

A tentative but sensible prediction is that, as with our individual reactions to what happens to us, there will be distinct responses to well-defined types of events – some producing large effects on average, and others little or none. \n\nBy asking what matters, some insight can be gained into the fundamental nature of the GCP effects. To the degree identifiable qualitative characteristics are associated with reliable correlations, we should be able to select future events to maximize effect size, leading to more powerful statistics and a better foundation for quantitative modeling.\n\nWe report on three structural categories; on four probes to assess the effect of emotions; on one distinction relating to the source or direction of attention; and on a categorization of events by type. We find that the number of people engaged by an event is a strong predictor of effect. On the other hand, being surprised by an event as opposed to knowing it is coming matters little. A\npurported “experimenter effect” is addressed by asking who chooses the events, but the definition of terms and interpretation of results are complicated.\n\nEmotional content definitely matters, with the rated level or intensity of emotion being a powerful predictor. In contrast, while we might wish to see positive, uplifting events making a stronger impression, their effects look quantitatively very much like those of negative events. Because the database is large, with more than 350 formal events accumulated over 12 years, we can make sound effect size estimates in many categories, despite an average effect size (about 1/3 sigma) which is too small for individual events to be reliably interpreted. We can even look at particular emotions of special interest, for example, fear or compassion. While our category analysis isn’t a direct source of material needed for quantitative modeling, it yields subjective insights that provide a qualitative understanding of what “global consciousness” might be like.\n\nRoger Nelson is the founder and director of the Global Consciousness Project (GCP), a long-running international collaboration of 100 researchers studying interactions of human consciousness and the environment.

In this talk, we discuss various meanings and definitions attributed -- generally unspecified or unspoken -- to consciousness, and how this lack of clarity leads to confusion with other concepts such as awareness, creativity, and experience, as well as with quantum measurement, psychic phenomena, and the existence of a personal identity. We discuss why it is a common misinterpretation of quantum mechanics to attribute the \"creation\" of physical reality to consciousness. Finally, we present several phenomena that genuinely ARE of interest in this regard, which do present serious evidence for the Self, and which deserve much more attention from science.\n\nRichard Shoup obtained his B.S.E.E. and Ph.D. Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. In 1970, he became one of the earliest employees at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he built one of the first digital painting and animation systems for video and graphic arts.

Neuroscientists can see the activity in distinct areas of the brain, but how is this constructed and bound together in unitary experiences and feelings still remains elusive. How can the nonmaterial mind influence the material body? Is consciousness the substrate of both, conceiving, forming and becoming biology, so interaction happens naturally?

Everything we know is formulated in terms of concepts. That is how we bring things to consciousness and think about them. But concepts are formed in the mind and therefore all we know about the world is, to some degree, a mind creation.\n\nTo approach the question of how the world must be without the intervention of mind, specific moments in the process of concept formation need to be elucidated. To say this more succinctly: to understand objectivity, subjectivity needs to be better understood.\n\nWhat actually happens when something is observed? Or the same question in different terms: what goes on during a moment of consciousness? A step towards an answer is the realization that conscious rational thought, which deals in concepts, is itself incapable of formulating concepts. In consciousness, thoughts succeed one another. To form a concept, instead of sequencing there needs to be an interpenetration of many potential impressions.\n\nThe ability to perform an act, say stirring your coffee, requires the influx of innumerable past experiences that blend and come to expression in the effortlessness accomplishment of the task. In a parallel manner, myriad impressions and associations coalesce to give rise to an object that registers in conscious thought. There is a coming together and when it reaches the ‘crunch’, the moment of fusion, consciousness enters and presto: there is a subject acknowledging an object. \n\nWe are not privy to the transformation of many to one and become aware only at the completion of the task, as the concept of some object alights in our mind. Out of a non-conscious process, consciousness arises together with a) the first person perspective, b) the observed object and c) the observing subject. The mind performs consciously and unconsciously in tandem.\n\nAnd what guides such a process? What can there be that prevails over the working of the out-of-conscious mind and sets the process of cognition in motion fusing qualities into an object of perception? To name it, no novel terminology is needed. We constantly mention it, referring to it as intention. Intent is the impetus to form meaning or to perform a specific act. Ignored in classical science and without a place in cybernetic emitter/receptor descriptions of communication, the ubiquity of intent has been left unacknowledged and yet without it, no unit of meaning would enter our minds and we would be zombies in a world totally out of reach.\n\nTerms implying intent are commonly employed when describing the mind and the natural world. Rather than being a case of the speaker resorting to personification, one can argue that, in fact, intent is a constituent part of what is being described.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

The design of the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) successfully shields the data from environmental influences like temperature and electromagnetic fields, but the vetted, normalized database can be probed for responses to a variety of other geophysical influences. However, our primary analyses apply to factors that are psychological and sociological. In particular, the formal “event experiment” is a replication series comprising a composite test of the general hypothesis that there will be non-random structure in the GCP data collected during major world events.\n\nAs of June 2008, we have examined about 250 events, and find structure associated with them, in confirmation of the composite hypothesis with million to one odds against chance. We can infer that this is related to human consciousness because the GCP data are affected during times of importance to people. A particular case is structure found during destructive earthquakes on land where they matter to humans, but not when the quakes are in the oceans. We see changes in the data when many people are focused on an event, sharing thoughts and especially emotions, indicating that some form of coherent interconnection is fundamental. We see a significant link with emotions. Large effects arise only for strong emotions, and the most powerful effects are produced by events that evoke or embody either fear or compassion.\n\nWe have determined that events engaging large numbers, millions of people, reliably show larger effects than those attracting attention from thousands or tens of thousands. The effects are driven by pair-wise correlation of the REG devices during events. We have identified multiple independent response measures which show deviations tracking the same global events. These include Network Variance and Covariance, and anomalous time and distance relationships for the measures.\n\nAmong the questions we are actively pursuing are indications that the GCP network response may begin minutes or hours before an event. We are looking carefully at an apparent distance scale for the correlations between REGs in the network, and at the possibility there may be a time-symmetrical response to the events. Other questions that deserve attention are significant long term trends in our measures that may reflect a collective mood or attitude prevailing over months and years, and suggestions of regular correlations for an exact 24-hour cycle but not for slightly longer or shorter artificial “days”, which may reflect a persistent, general effect of human consciousness.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Kenneth Arnette","description":"Philosophical Substance Abuse: Distorting Descartes and Dismissing Dualism \nJ. Kenneth Arnette\nDepartment of Psychology\nSouthern Oregon University\n\nRene Descartes gave his conception of what later became known as substance dualism, setting off a vigorous, ongoing debate about the mind-body relationship. The primary tenets of his view included: (1) a \"substance\" is \"a thing capable of existing independently;\" (2) mind and body both are substances, but (3) mind is thinking and non- extended, whereas (4) body is non-thinking and extended; (5) the body has the property of exclusionary occupation of space; and (6) the human being is an interactive union of mind and body. Descartes never provided a mechanism of mind-body interaction, but felt that mind and body could share some characteristics. The focus of the present work is not on interaction, but on the possible nature of the hypothesized non-material mental substance. Descartes made radical distinctions between mind and body, but it is also true that subsequently these distinctions have been distorted by materialists to consist of the following description: the non-physical mind has neither mass nor energy, is not in any way localizable, does not exist in space, has nothing in common with physical things, and works independently of the brain. This is even more radical than Descartes' proposals, and ignores many of his specific points. If both body and mind fit the definition of substance, then they must share some properties in order to belong to that category. Descartes was in no position to offer a solution to this problem, but modern physics (relativity and string theory) offers a resolution. Relativity provides a relationship between matter and energy: the energy (E) in a given amount of matter is the mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. This defines matter energetically. One can thus view matter as a form of condensed energy, with a certain energy density. One can imagine a series of substances (any form of condensed energy), differing in their energy densities. For example, matter could be a particular case of a general substance-energy relationship, where energy (E) is the amount of substance i (Si) multiplied by the speed of light to the power i (ci). For matter, i = 2 (substance S2). The mental substance could be represented by substance S1. Thus the mental substance would be much less energy- dense than matter. S1 would display basic differences from matter in the way it is constructed from energy, with important property differences. For example, substances S1 and S2, being very different in energy density, could simultaneously occupy the same three-dimensional space. String theory shows how two different substances could be constructed. Strings are tiny strands of energy, the basic building blocks of everything, comprising two types: open-ended (OE) and closed-loop (CL). OE strings are attached on each end to our spacetime (universe), while CL strings are free-floating and capable of leaving this spacetime. In addition, CL strings are much less energy-dense than OE strings. Thus, OE and CL strings can be construed as different substances, with some shared and some differing properties, promising candidates for Descartes’ substance dualism.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Kenneth Arnette","description":"Consciousness is to Energy as Energy is to Matter\nJ. Kenneth Arnette\nTranspersonal Institute for the Scientific Study of the Paranormal\n\nThere are many facets to the philosophical and scientific study of consciousness, but philosopher David Chalmers has identified a core issue, which he called the hard problem of consciousness. To paraphrase, the hard problem is: how can matter—regardless of the degree of complexity of its organization—generate something so radically different from itself, namely, thought, ideas, subjective experience, and consciousness? Indeed, it truly is a puzzle that the most tangible, least ephemeral thing we know—matter—could generate the most ephemeral, least tangible thing we know—consciousness itself. It would seem that in a fully material world, biological mechanisms would proceed on their own, without any accompanying awareness or subjectivity. The hard problem, as stated, reflects the assumption that the brain does generate the mind and asks how that can be accomplished. But just as easily, one could make the opposite assumption, that matter does not generate consciousness, and the hard problem dissolves (although other problems ensue). Chalmers’ own response to the question he posed has been called naturalistic dualism: consciousness has a natural ontological status equal to matter-energy and spacetime, the two other basic components of the universe, and cannot be reduced to the workings of these two. For Chalmers, consciousness is irreducible, but not supernatural. Thus, the brain does not generate consciousness or subjectivity, which are nonetheless natural phenomena. While appealing, this view ultimately is not satisfying. It fails to say what consciousness is, beyond irreducible and natural, neither offering nor explaining a mind-brain relationship. Chalmers’ response in fact fails to address the relationships among the three basic entities cited above. I propose instead that we turn the entire problem backwards: to entertain the notion that consciousness is the most fundamental thing, and that everything else is literally constructed from it. Consider as a starting point Einstein’s famous equation relating energy to matter. Besides the quantitative information given by this equation, there are some implicit ontological statements. One is that matter is merely a condensed form of energy; matter is constructed from energy. (Contemporary string theory suggests two forms resulting from this construction.) Thus, at some point shortly after the Big Bang, energy condensed into matter; the less tangible became the more tangible. Working from this model, dissolution of the hard problem can be accomplished by taking this energy- matter relationship one step back: energy is a condensed form of consciousness, analogous to the energy-matter relationship—consciousness:energy::energy:matter. This concept has advantages: (1) it is logical in that this is the order of tangibility of the three substances; (2) it is easier to envision a constitutive consciousness-energy relationship than the assumed relationship in which matter produces consciousness; and (3) it incorporates this part of relativity in a consistent and logical way. Consciousness thus is the primordial substance; self-awareness and subjectivity are two of its essential aspects, irreducibility a third. When consciousness condenses into energy, it loses this awareness, partially or, more probably, completely. When energy condenses into matter, any remaining awareness is lost. Therefore self-awareness is not to be found in the realms of matter-energy and spacetime, yet all of this is ultimately constructed from and composed of consciousness. Finally, I will suggest new problems revealed by this perspective, since it is clearly incomplete, and some brief comments on how these ideas relate to some well- known modern philosophical figures and their positions on the mind-body problem.\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Thus, for example, as Jerry Fodor, one of the philosophers who has been instrumental in its development has said recently in his book The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way: AI would have thought that the last forty or fifty years have demonstrated pretty clearly that there are aspects of higher mental processes into which the current armamentarium of computational models, theories, and experimental techniques offers vanishingly little insight.  In particular, computationalism cannot adequately address the hard problem of consciousness, namely the manner in which an experiential stream arises from a biological organism.\n\nOne way of getting past this impasse is to reject Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s neuron doctrine as the wrong level at which to look for consciousness. That is to say, consciousness may not be an emergent property of cellular activity, but could somehow be related to more fundamental subatomic events. This has been suggested, for example, by Ian Marshall, who has associated consciousness with Fröhlich’s Bose-Einstein like condensation in the brain. Similarly, Mari Jibu, Yasushi Takahashi, and Kunio Yasue have proposed that memory is encoded as a spinor field constituting a system of corical proteins and water. Such theories suggest the occurrence of some form of organic quantum computing thereby retaining some of the features of computation without the usual reliance on cellular networks.\n\nAnother fix has been to suggest, most famously by Eugene Wigner, that consciousness is a non-physical reality that terminates the von Neumann chain in an act of measurement of quantum events. For Henry Stapp, choice enters into the picture, not with the selection of a particular eigenvector but, in keeping with the constraints of contextuality, the selection of those observables which are to be measured. With the postulation of such dynamics, volitional acts can be clearly distinguished from perceptual ones, as noted by Evan Harris Walker, so that discussions of consciousness include the manner in which free will could be directly exercised on physical matter. Of course, the need for state vector collapse has been challenged by decoherence theories.\n\nPerhaps there is something to both of these approaches, namely that volition and consciousness are non-emergent essential ingredients of reality that find expression at the subatomic level. Jean Burns has proposed that volition is exercised within the scope of quantum fluctuations to change the position or momentum of particles. The occurrence of such events in the brain would provide a mechanism for mental influence on one’s actions.\n\nWhat happens if we second quantize and extend this notion to quantum fields? In particular, consider a Klein-Gordon field on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime with mode functions chosen so as to allow the zero vector of the Fock basis to be the vacuum state. Volitional agency within the scope of the field fluctuations would correspond to changes in the activity of creation and annihilation operators affecting the eigenvectors representing reality. Although we have considered only a single scalar field and the experiential intentional stream of consciousness is not thereby theoretically determined, this type of strategy allows for volition to be seen as being exercised at a fundamental level of reality.\n\nOf course, as Michael Lipkind has pointed out, A [field theoretic] approaches can easily degenerate into purely belletristic expressions. Quantum field theory might not be the right way of incorporating psychological variables into a physical theory but it could point toward a post- quantum theory of consciousness.\n\nImants Barušs obtained an interdisciplinary BSc, a MSc in mathematics, and PhD in psychology with specialization in consciousness. He has been teaching for 21 years in the Department of Psychology at King’s University College at The University of Western Ontario where he has risen to the rank of professor. His research is concerned with fundamental issues regarding the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the physical world. \n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, Mark Crewson, Mark Urban-Lurain, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

That notion is wrong. In fact, there are dual approaches to nearly every physics concept. The implications affect not only how we think about physics, but also many other disciplines.\n\nThe concept of dualism has a long history in the philosophy of mind, in which mind and matter are viewed as separate. Here I show that conventionally accepted physical theory is also described by two types of theory, one mind-like and the other matter-like.

This has been most parsimoniously illustrated by Plank’s infamous dictum that “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” In more sociological terms, the untested “background assumptions” (Gouldner) of a culture change to more resonantly accommodate the new ideas.\n\nAnecdotally, it appears as if a generational shift may be in progress, whereby the intractable knee jerk hostile reactions to their subject matter that so many in the SSE and PA have experienced are softening in the general culture. And while the academy may indeed remain the most conservative, lay persons and industry may have taken the lead in openness to innovative exploration.\n\nOf course, it’s possible that the academy may also finally be poised to shift by “advancing one funeral at a time” (Planck). Intellectual capital, though, is not just limited to abstract ideas, but also has practical applications. This can be illustrated in the area of anomalous healing.\n\nIn many in vivo and in vitro experiments over the course of 35 years, I have demonstrated robust and reliable data that demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that “healing” can happen, that dose is a factor, that healing proceeds non-linearly, that it is not fundamentally “energy” but “information” that is at work, that it is not correlated to a particular state of mind but functions more as an autonomic response to the need of the healee, to name but a few findings. I’m also working on the non-psychological components of placebo explained as an actual resonant bond between physically separated groups.\n\nAnd while the list of basic research questions regarding anomalous healing remains inexhaustible, my current research also includes the question of whether the healing effect can be “captured” and “reproduced” without the healer. In other words, can we store and independently deliver healing in a practical fashion? Selected current research on whether biological systems can recognize “stored” healing will be presented, along with work designed to test whether “recordings” of healing potential can bring about healing outcomes.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Bauer","description":"Seeking Immortality? Challenging the Drug-Based Medical Paradigm\n\nChronic ailments—arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular problems, kidney and liver and other organ failures—arise in different ways and for different reasons than do infectious diseases. Drugs have been very successful in overcoming infectious diseases, but their application to chronic ailments is illogical and harmful. Is a treatment against cardiovascular disease (for example) beneficial? Does it prolong life and improve quality of life? Valid answers would be based on very large and lengthy clinical trials controlling for innumerable variables—essentially impossible. Therefore research and applications make use of surrogate markers, measurables like blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. But in order to determine whether a surrogate marker is an accurate measure of the state of a chronic ailment would require one of those impossible clinical trials. The use of surrogate markers is based more on faith than evidence. Worse, it assumes that correlations identify causations.\n\nThe commonly used surrogate markers are not valid. Nevertheless, drugs continue to be approved because of their effect on these markers. Further, the accelerated approval of drugs initiated in the 1990s requires only two successful trials of at least six months duration. That is not nearly long enough to test safety or efficacy, and the last two decades have seen an increasing number of once-approved drugs withdrawn after less and less time on the market because of their deadly so-called “side” effects. “Side” is a fatally misleading misnomer.\n\nThe misguided drug-based treatment of chronic ailments is facilitated by semantic sleight-of- word, calling natural conditions diseases, dysfunctions, abnormal: cardiovascular disease; hypertension; “high” and “bad” cholesterol; “pre”-diabetes, “pre”-hypertension, etc.\n\nOutstandingly illogical is the approach to blood pressure. For more than a century it’s been known that blood pressure normally rises with age. But nowadays “hypertension” is defined by the same number irrespective of age, so that the average person normally attains “hypertension” at about age 60; some 75% of American seniors are treated with drugs to lower what is the normal pressure for their age.\n\nBlood pressure increases with age. Mortality increases with age. The incidence of cancers and of organ failures increases with age. Everything that increases with age is correlated with everything else that increases with age. Therefore blood pressure is correlated with every chronic ailment, but it doesn’t necessarily cause any of them.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Pollack, PhD \n(Dinsdale Award Speaker) \nUniversity of Washington, Seattle \n\nSchool children learn that water has three phases: solid, liquid and vapor. But we have recently uncovered a fourth phase. This phase occurs next to water-loving (hydrophilic) surfaces. It is surprisingly extensive, projecting out from the surface by up to millions of molecular layers. And, its properties differ substantially from those of bulk water.\n\nOf particular significance is the observation that this fourth phase is charged; and, the water just beyond is oppositely charged, creating a battery that can produce current. We found that light charges this battery. Thus, water can receive and process electromagnetic energy drawn from the environment in much the same way as plants. Absorbed electromagnetic (light) energy can then be exploited for performing work, including electrical and mechanical work. Recent experiments confirm the reality of such energy conversion.\n\nThe energy-conversion framework implied above seems rich with implication. Not only does it provide an understanding of how water processes solar and other energies, but also it may provide a foundation for simpler understanding natural phenomena ranging from weather and green energy all the way to biological issues such as the origin of life, transport, and osmosis.\n\nThe lecture will present evidence for the presence of this novel phase of water, and will consider the potentially broad implications of this phase for physics, chemistry and biology, as well as some practical applications for health and technology.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Explorers for providing the support we need to keep our video content freely available online: Dr. CMC Toporow, Kathleen Erickson, and Roger Nelson.\n\nWant to help us improve the quality of our videos?

Either these things exist, it is presumed, or they are the products of error and deception. To a degree, this is a defensible approach. Beyond that, however, the frame of reference is woefully inadequate, failing to explain vividly felt encounters with otherworldly beings and beasts which over all of history human beings have experienced, even as no compelling evidence of their presence in consensus reality has ever emerged. Clark’s lecture discusses anomalous events vs. experience anomalies, which – though epistemologically unrelated –have a curiously parasitic relationship, and calls for a radical new understanding of the strange occurrences that have plagued, infuriated and fascinated human beings at all times and places.\n\nJerome Clark has been interested in anomalistics all his life. He is the author of nearly 20 books on the subject, including the multi-volume UFO Encyclopedia (1990- 1998), and has won a number of literary prizes, including the Benjamin Franklin Award (twice) from the Publishers Marketing Association for lead titles in the Popular Science and Environment category.\n\nHe has been an editor of International UFO Reporter for more than two decades and has served on the board of the Center for UFO Studies for as long. He worked on the editorial staff of the popular paranormal monthly Fate between 1976 and 1989. Recently, he returned to the magazine as book-review editor.Besides his work in ufology and Forteana, he is a music critic and songwriter who has had songs placed with popular country and folk performers including Emmylou Harris, Tom T.

Although in the beginning the Society’s goal was to achieve recognition from, and eventually become accepted by the community of established scientists, as the years went by it became evident that SSE has come to represent the vanguard of scientific exploration, addressing issues that are at the cutting edge of knowledge.

This Society is an important scholarly entity, and it is destined to become far more consequential in its intellectual, political, and administrative future as its public purview matures. There is just one minor issue: no one seems quite to grasp what such a lecture should address, or, for that matter, how a “founder” should be defined. Does he (or she) epitomize a certain array of values or talents or visions? Does he favor a particular scholarly strategy? Does he deploy a particularly effective style of operation? And if so, what is it? Alternatively, does the opportunity carry with it its own set of prerogatives to be espoused in due course? Frankly, given the uncertainty of our governing body to concur on the definition of the lecture, I have arbitrarily opted for the second alternative.\n\nThis opens the thesis of this lecture to inclusion of various elements of philosophy, history, and science, a tad of each I shall try to include, but at the end of the effort, it must be your values, your recollections, and your intuitions, that must prevail! Why? Because it is your Society, you must drive it, and it must drive you, or it will never fulfill itself or fully prosper. Oh, there have indeed been founders, in the traditional sense. Most of them very good. Most of us know who they are and were, what they have done, and what we owe them. But what is needed now is new blood, new energy, new wisdom, new commitment. The founders should be honored, but not replicated. SSE must continue to mature to an exciting, productive entity that fulfills its founders’ spirit on an on-going basis, as it grows with its insights and achievements compounding.\n\nAn example: over past decades, my long-term colleague, Brenda Dunne, has labored to sustain our founders’ spirit in a cadre of exciting and excited young people who, with fresh ideas and fresh energies, could carry our founders’ heritage forward into new topi- cal areas and scientific strategies that will continue to broaden the range and impact of many classes of anomalous phenomena, and our understanding and profitable application of them. Therein resides the real future of the Society and the mighty social role our founders have foreseen for it. We shall always need to think well, to plan well, and to share our best thoughts well. But we must teach well also, and that requires that we teach others to teach well, at every level. This is now our missing link. \n\nThe cultural educational system lacks this element of outreach. Who will provide it? Public education? Not likely. Private institutions? Better organized religions? Forget it. What is the entity to preside effectively over this inculcation of global insight? Anybody you know? Think about it!\n\nRobert G. Jahn is Professor Emeritus of Aerospace Sciences and Dean Emeritus of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University.

In all facets of psi interactions through space and time – remote sensing, presentiment, telepathy, and psychokinesis – either the agent or the receiver, or both, are alive and consciousness.\n\nThe link between psi and consciousness is so firm that when psi effects have been found in lower life forms, that finding has been used as evidence that these life forms are conscious. We presume that it is because dogs are conscious that they can be aware of when their owners decide to come home. Finches exhibit precognition of an image of a crawling snake. There is even some evidence that earthworms have sufficient consciousness to anticipate vibrations.\n\nInanimate systems, on the other hand, have shown psi effects only when interacting with animate systems, as in mind-matter interactions. Electronic random event generators are subject to influence or access by the consciousness of individuals or groups.\n\nMust one of the parties in a psi interaction be living? If not, is that evidence for machine consciousness? We have developed a system in which two Psyleron electronic random number generators are linked to produce a psi interaction. The results provide evidence in deciding whether inanimate systems exhibit a fundamental characteristic of consciousness.\n\nGarret Moddel is a professor of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado.

The lack of RV software tools that could enhance the effectiveness of work in this field could be due to the fact that there are few software developers operating in the world of RV. IRIS Intuition Consulting saw the opportunity to take-on the challenge and invested in an R&D program dedicated to the development of RV software.\n\nIn 2010 nearly $19,000 was allocated to research, and the iCAT session analysis software tool (using a crosschecking method) was created. This multipurpose software works on session transcripts, identifies any and all unitary information (concepts), defines sorting categories while sorting, and for projects involving more than one viewer, crosschecks through the different categories. iCAT has enabled the IRIS team to work almost ten times faster than when they were using MS-Excel. This significant time saving frees up the analyst to better concentrate on both the details and scope of data. Thus, project delivery times, quantity of data, and quality of RV projects have all been enhanced. All IRIS’ clients benefit from this increased effectiveness and each project has become profitable. In addition, a surprising effect was noticed: as the software developed in functionality and speed of operation, the amount of information generated by the viewers increased to such a level that by September 2010, the maximum amount of time allotted to each session was decreased.\n\nToday IRIS has embarked on another R&D project to develop a web platform so that session work can be recorded with related statistical information, and with automatic computer analysis of the session. The implementation of this web platform will help improve the training process of viewers and offer other types of valuable services to viewers whether they are professionals, amateurs, or in training. The platform could eventually define and become the international database standard for RV.\n\nBio: Alexis Champion holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a specialty in Artificial Intelligence.

Wood","description":"The Mystery of Joe Papp’s Noble Gas Engine: Does spark-initiated pulsed plasma of a hydrogen, chlorine, and noble gas soup in the presence radioactive metals indicate novel energy?\nRyan S. Wood \n\nThe talk will cover the history of the inventor Joseph Papp from his education and early work experience in Hungary under Alexander Szalay, founder at ATOMKI, the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, to his immigration to Canada, and creation and alleged demonstration of a 300 mph submarine with novel engine propulsion. He then moved to California where three separate demonstrations and explosions occurred of the noble gas technology: one with the Naval Undersea Warfare Laboratory and the other in the Environetics parking lot (Los Angeles County) and at TRW in the presence of many witnesses including Dr. Richard Feynman. A forensic content analysis of the patents and lawsuits will be presented along with a psychological profile of Papp. Both TRW and General Dynamics expressed interest and worked with Papp in varying degrees to reduce his technology to practice and further understand the noble gas internal engine demonstrations and explosions. A timeline of the technology development from the beginning in Hungary to Papp’s death in 1989 will be presented. Many official sources are used in this preparation, from Royal Canadian Mounted Police, French Gendarmerie interviews, and FBI interviews, newspaper articles, police files, court documents, corner reports and living witness interviews with participants. Legal counsel responsible for managing the court-ordered settlement for Papp and Environetics was interviewed. A summary of technical claims and sources will be presented and analyzed.\n\nThe results of the technical data investigation shows that a reasonable man would conclude that there is novel energy. This is accomplished by tapping of (nuclear?) energy in a low temperature method not fully understood (or forgotten) by modern physics. A gaseous photochlorination chain reaction in the presence of hydrogen and subsequent recombination appears to be a key aspect of the Papp Engine. Walter Nernst was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1920 in part for work in this area and R.G.W. Norrish’s science in photochemistry showed that chlorine & hydrogen have sharp limits of pressure, varying markedly with temperature, below which the chain reaction is slow and above which it becomes explosive. This may be what is happening in the Papp Engine. \nThis conclusion is based on the historical science, witness testimony, film evidence, patents, official interviews, and one historical certified power-in power-out controlled test. However, to date this technology although allegedly replicated by several independent groups has failed to create a working engine system for high quality 3rd party validation testing.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nHelp us improve the quality of our videos by supporting the Society for Scientific Exploration on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=23234339\n\nTake your support of our 501(c)(3) nonprofit even further by  becoming an SSE member: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Blasband, M.D.\n\nIn June of 2013, Dr. Dominique Surel and I explored the use of a pendulum in objectifying the flow of a perceived “subtle energy” effect when experimenting with a Wilhelm Reich “cloudbuster”. The device, which we call an atmospheric energy engineering device or AEED, was set-up in a park near Evergreen, CO in order to train students in its operation in anticipation of drought in Colorado and the Mid-West. Since Dr. Surel was expert in the use of the pendulum to detect subtle energy frequencies we thought it might be useful in detecting possible such “energies” in our training demonstrations of the AEED.\n\nThe device consists of an array of maneuverable metal pipes which are “grounded” into running water. For training purposes the pipes were aimed at cumulus clouds in order to demonstrate cloud disruption. Within minutes of raising the grounded pipes to near-zenith we both experienced sensations of heavy overall “pressure” in the body, nausea, and “pulling” in the diaphragm. We backed away from the device and Dr. Surel, having recovered from the acute noxious effects, approached the device from several angles using the pendulum to detect changes in what we hypothesized was the outer edge of a “field” of subtle energy. The outline of the outer edge of the field was staked, measured, and photographed. The field extended up to several dozen feet from the device in an unexpected pattern.\n\nI will present details and photographs of the operation and a brief confirmatory report of a follow-up study conducted four months later.\n\nWe hypothesize that the noxious effects were due to what Reich called “oranur” and the ancient Egyptians called “negative electric green” frequency.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nHelp us improve the quality of our videos by supporting the Society for Scientific Exploration on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=23234339\n\nTake your support of our 501(c)(3) nonprofit even further by  becoming an SSE member: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

For the previous six years the water level in the Sea of Galilee had decreased every year until reaching dangerously low levels in 1983. Most farming in Israel depends upon water from this source.\n\nA reconnaissance the previous year and the clearing of all potential legal issues paved the way for our beginning operations in January, when the rainy season usually begins. At that time certain meteorological factors come into play, which will be described in the oral presentation. Needless to say we wanted to optimize our possibilities so began working in Haifa at that time.\n\nI and my companion, who provided major assistance throughout the entire trip, utilized a device that Wilhelm Reich had invented that he labeled the “cloudbuster” because of its ready ability to break up clouds when operated in a certain way. It is a simple apparatus made up of six (in our work) ten-foot-long metal pipes 1/12 inch in diameter, “grounded” by flexible metal cable into running water. The pipes are attached to a wooden “Lazy Susan”–type base that can be readily rotated and elevated.\n\nUtilizing what Reich called the “orgonomic potential” in the atmosphere one is able to have clouds concentrate and, in time, produce rain over the site of operations. This is functionally the reverse of cloudbusting.\n\nOperating at the beach with the pipes grounded into the Mediterranean Sea on a cloudless day with no rain or clouds in the past several weeks and no rain expected within 48 hours, the limits of accurate prediction in those days, we succeeded in bringing clouds and rain within 24 hours at the Haifa location. Utilizing essentially the same type of operating protocol we moved in leaps south along the coast generating rain at each stop as the storm systems built and followed us.\n\nMoving East we crossed Israel, stopping once before arriving at the Negev, the vast desert which makes up a good part of Israel. Operating in the desert and then at Elat, at the southernmost tip of Israel, we succeeded in bringing rain to most of the state, including the desert.\n\nWeather reports noted that the water level in the Sea of Galilee was above that expected for that time of year and that rainfall there on the 24 and 25th of January, when we were in Elat, was heavier in the South compared to what it was in the North, an anomalous situation, but consistent with our intentions.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nHelp us improve the quality of our videos by supporting the Society for Scientific Exploration on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=23234339\n\nTake your support of our 501(c)(3) nonprofit even further by  becoming an SSE member: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

And a great such opportunity for the USA SSE audience is coming up – The Great American Eclipse of 21 August 2017.\n\nPrevious experimental results: There is a significant history of anomalistic results obtained by the use of sensitive physical equipment during solar eclipses. Sensitive 2D pendulums (such as paraconical pendulums), long pendulums, torsion pendulums, Lacoste-Romberg gravimeters, and atomic clocks have been employed.\n\n• Allais – 1954. He recorded a surge in the precession rate of his paraconical pendulum reaching four times the Foucault rate, together with a change in the orientation of the pendulum anisotropy axes.\n• Saxl & Allen – 1970. Anomalies were seen in the motion of a heavy torsion pendulum.\n• Duval – 1994, Mishra – 1995, and Wang – 1997. Interesting variations in gravimeter readings were observedduring eclipses.\n• Zhou obtained interesting results in 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992 using atomic clocks.\n• Goodey, Olenici, Pugach – 2008. Correlated anomalies of the movement of two paraconical pendulums, one long pendulum, and several small torsion balances were observed at three locations.\n• Verreault – 2009. Using a long pendulum, a smooth surge in precession rate reaching 30% of the Foucault rate was observed.\n\nProposition for coordinated experiments during the 2017 Solar Eclipse: For the 2017 eclipse, which passes across the USA, our group wants to urge institutions and individuals in North America to set up and perform experiments of the general types that have yielded apparently positive results in the past, and to give them the guidance of our experience. There is no particular requirement for an experimental station to be upon the central line of totality: based upon past experience, any observational location in Canada, the USA, or Mexico may be capable of yielding interesting results.\n\nWe consider that gravimeter experiments during the eclipse will be of great importance, and we urge any group in possession of a Lacoste-Romberg gravimeter to contact us for suggestions, and to operate attentively during the eclipse at a suitable orientation. However, the field in which we have most experience is the field of sensitive pendulums. We hope that multiple well-organized and standardized experiments may have a chance to settle this long-standing question once and for all. Therefore we propose participation in a program of experiments with medium-length pendulums. We appeal for SSE members to consider setting up such pendulums in their base locations, and we are ready to supply standardized equipment for such experiments.\nA group may already have a pendulum – either a long Foucault pendulum or some other type – which is suitable. In that case, they will only need to obtain from us standardized monitoring equipment which we have designed and prototyped. Alternatively, if a group wishes us to provide one or more suitable pendulums, we can do that. We hope to have one of our pendulums operating for demonstration at the conference.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This naturally sounds absurd since it is obvious (or so it seems) that we live on a planet that is part of a universe that is made of real, solid stuff. Information, per se, has no physical existence. The structure of a cat, a car or a calculator may be the result of information put to use, but the bare information itself is nowhere to be found. So what is the motivation for entertaining such an odd hypothesis as digital physics operating in an unreal world? It lies in the possibility of thereby being able to treat the universe as a vast computer. In a recent published paper — “Is The Universe a Vast, Consciousness-Created Virtual Reality Simulation?” which was also presented at the 2014 SSE Meeting — I made a case for this. The foundational idea is that one and only one thing exists: some vast — or perhaps even unbounded — transcendent consciousness having the attendant capability of thought. This consciousness can serve as the hardware for computation while its thoughts can be the software: algorithms and data, organized in such a way as to foster computer-like capabilities. In this way some or all of the transcendent consciousness takes on the attributes and abilities of a computer capable of creating an entire universe of the imagination. The transcendent consciousness would have the ability to chose its laws of physics and would be able to dream up and keep track of the roughly 1080 protons and electrons we have in the universe, along with other particles.\n\nWading into deep philosophical waters, it has been proposed that the transcendent consciousness projects itself into the virtual lifeforms that Darwinian-like evolution would bring about on the virtual planets of this virtual universe. Some of the transcendent consciousness becomes the billions upon billions of avatars living in the greatest of simulations. The objective of this entire scheme would be for the transcendent consciousness to give itself the means of having experience through the actions of its avatar selves. And the ultimate objective could be to provide a means for evolution and self-perfection. In this ultimate simulation of physical reality the transcendent consciousness could experience the thrill of racing down a mountain... but also the grief of a loved one’s death. (In my view death in such a reality is merely a transition from being an active avatar inhabited by consciousness to returning to a higher level immaterial state, and back and forth... likely many times.)\n\nIf true, this would be the basis of a Theory of Everything on the grandest possible scale. Is there any evidence for this?\n\nMy introduction to these ideas is due to Tom Campbell, a physicist and author of the book: “My Big TOE\" (Theory of Everything). Campbell was recruited by Robert Monroe in the early 1970s to devise and carry out scientific studies of the altered consciousness experiences, and Out of Body Experiences (OBEs) in particular, that Monroe was investigating; see Monroe’s seminal 1971 “Journeys out of the Body.” Since that time Campbell has been able to induce scores of OBEs which he has used to explore and map the landscape of realities adjacent to our own which will be presented at this meeting.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Sheehan\nDept. of Physics, University of San Diego\n\nIn 2000, Duncan proposed a simple thermodynamic paradox: a sealed blackbody cavity contains a diatomic gas and a radiometer whose apposing vane surfaces dissociate the dimer and recombine the monomers to different degrees [1,2]. Owing to differing desorption rates of the dimers and monomers, there arise between the vane faces permanent pressure and temperature differences, either of which can be harnessed to perform work, in conflict with the second law of thermodynamics [3]. This paper reports on the first experimental realization of this paradox [4], involving the dissociation of low-pressure hydrogen gas on high-temperature refractory metals (tungsten and rhenium). The results, corroborated by other laboratory studies [5] and supported by theory [6,7], confirm Duncan's paradoxical temperature difference and point to physics beyond the traditional understanding of the second law.

Kenneth Arnette","description":"Energy is not Conserved: Connections among Consciousness, Thermodynamics, and String Theory\nJ. Kenneth Arnette, Ph.D.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy (or Matter-Energy, in the case of nuclear processes) is a bedrock principle in the physical sciences that has never been seriously questioned. Yet, this law has also never been proven to apply generally to all systems and situations. With the advent of string theory, a fundamental question concerning energy’s conservation arises, due to the facts that string theory: (1) proposes at least one additional extended spatial dimension beyond our familiar three; (2) suggests that gravitons are closed-loop strings composed of energy; and (3) holds that gravitons are not affixed to space-time, and so can (and do) escape our space-time and leave our universe — thus representing a net loss of energy. Further, a type of anomalous subjective experience, the near-death experience, strongly hints that consciousness is associated with closed-loop strings, and that upon physical death, one’s consciousness leaves this universe (the implication being that consciousness enters this universe the same way it leaves). Therefore, my hypothesis is that energy leaks from this universe in the form of gravitons, and is exchanged between this universe and a parallel one through the transitions of individual consciousnesses between the two space-times. If my hypothesis is correct, then the conservation law must be severely revised to apply only to certain physical systems that involve neither consciousness nor gravitation. But, since all mass is associated with gravitation to a greater or lesser degree (depending on the magnitude of the mass involved), it is difficult to see how the conservation law can be saved; instead, it should be seen as an approximation that holds best for inanimate, low-mass, physical systems.\n\nKenny Arnette is currently an undergraduate philosophy major at the University of Memphis, and expects to be entering graduate school this Fall. He previously earned Ph.D. degrees in Physical Chemistry and Counseling Psychology, and is a Licensed Professional Counselor (Colorado). He has been a member of SSE since 2001.

Beichler","description":"Physical Origins of the Consciousness Revolution\nJames E. Beichler\n\nDespite all the assumed and presumed fundamental differences between relativity and quantum theory, it is possible to unify them into a single physical model of reality. Both theories are incomplete at present and have fundamental problems, but they can be simply unified once they are presented in their complete and corrected forms. General relativity is incomplete for not accounting for point-elements. Riemannian geometry is based solely on metric-elements of spatial extension, while quantum theory has been completely misrepresented since 1927. So, while relativity theory is based only upon a metric geometry of extensions, scientists have advanced quantum theory believing that it is either a non-geometric point-particle/field theory or a theory of discrete point events occurring against the background of an unspecified quantum point/absolute geometry.\n\nOnce these two elements are understood, point and extension, it becomes evident that Riemannian geometry is based upon a 0-D point/twist Void which is equivalent to a discrete quantum point. This fact allows for an interpretation of the Big Bang model from which general relativity predicts our universe emerged from an individual singularity in the absolute Void. The Big Bang and the subsequent cosmic inflation from which our present universe emerged can be logically remodeled to show that both a single (unified) field of potential, which is the precursor to all our material reality, and a semi-physical pre-consciousness field of potential were simultaneously produced by the event that ended cosmic inflation to produce our present universe.\n\nThe pre-consciousness field ‘force’ the eventual evolution of life (biofield), mind and consciousness within our universe. To manifest the influence of the pre-consciousness field on material reality, a new form of top-down evolution based on thermodynamics as opposed to the older Darwinian and genetic bottom-up form of evolution is proposed. The older forms of evolution are neither discredited nor discarded, but rather completed and supplemented by the new top-down evolution. Top-down evolution proceeds from mind and/or consciousness to the genome where it influences future generations of living organisms and thereby clarifies many of the mysteries and problems that are inherent in modern bottom-up evolution theory. This model of evolution strongly implies that a new leap in human evolution is overdue and that a new human species will emerge. This evolutionary leap will accompany the coming revolution in science.\n\nBio: Professor Beichler has been teaching Physics, Mathematics, the History and Philosophy of Science and European History as well as other related subjects at the university and college level for more than three decades.

At the basic level the theory suggests a physical model of two fundamental particles associated with the Planck’s scale parameters (time and length). In pure empty space, as assumed precondition of the physical vacuum, they interact by close range forces according to a law called Supergravitation (SG) and congregate in formations possessing vibration properties with embedded frequency ratio equal to the fine structure constant, ~ 1/137. Such formations are embedded in the superfine structure of the physical vacuum and the elementary particles. In the physical vacuum space, the SG forces are strong at atomic distances. The suggested model works well in different fields of Physics. It provides a relation between the electrical, magnetic and gravitational fields with new understanding of the gravity and inertia. The unveiled oscillating properties of the electron [5] permit understanding the physical mechanism of quantum mechanical interaction between the electrons in EM activated plasma and the physical vacuum. The new understanding about the physical vacuum allows predicting a possibility of unidirectional change the gravitational force acting on a material object. By proper modulation the parameters of the physical vacuum, the gravito-inertial mass of a specifically designed spacecraft would be reduced, so it could be accelerated with less energy. Technically the new space drive mechanism could be realized by electromagnetically activated neutral plasma surrounding the spacecraft. In such approach secondary effects, such as optical glow, hissing noise, light bending and disturbed propagation of EM waves and Earth magnetic field would take place in the surrounding zone. In atmospheric environment, the spacecraft may exhibit a reduced turbulence since the mass of the air molecule should be also affected. The predicted space drive should work also in a deep space. In this case a gas cloud surrounding the spacecraft is necessary. Initial laboratory experiments confirm some of the predicted effects, such as, weak propulsion, optical glow, hissing noise and reduced turbulence. Extensive research in this new field is still necessary.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This has always been a controversial topic, attracting the attention of many leading physicists. This presentation gives evidence for the vortical or spiral fabric of space from a new perspective: biology. Specifically, the structure of the eye validates the “spiral grain of the universe” concept described by Vladimir B. Ginzburg in his book with that title as well as in Ginsburg’s 4 additional books. Ginzburg traces the repeating cycles as such models went in and out of vogue over the centuries. James Clerk Maxwell and his friend, Michael Faraday supported a vortex theory of electromagnetism with potential fields as the centerpiece. Two years after Maxwell’s early death (he was only 48 years old), Oliver Heaviside and others replaced Maxwell’s quaternions with vector algebra, elimi-nating the potential fields as “arbitrary and unnecessary.” By the end of the 1800’s Maxwell’s foundational equations of electromagnetism had been reduced from the original 20 to the 4 we find in physics texts today. Deleting scalar and potential fields deprived physics, biology and medicine of important theoretical tools for nearly a century. The forgotten potentials have important implications for virtually all areas of physiology and medicine. We trace the pathway followed by light through the vortically organized corneal stroma of the eye and the alpha-helical rhodopsin molecules in the outer segments of the retina. The alpha helical portions of receptors found on the membranes of all cells in the body may be vortical “light pipes” that convey light into cell interiors. While this is a new idea for animal physiology, it is well known in plant physiology, where alpha helical membrane proteins are thought to function as “light pipes” that enable algae to survive in weak light environments. Direct biophotonic stimulation of enzymes and other molecules within the cell without mediation of “second messengers” is feasible and has been demonstrated. v\n\nReference: J Vortex Sci Technol 2: 112. http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2090-8369.1000112.\n\nBio: Jim Oschman is an internationally recognized expert on the scientific basis for Energy Medicine.

However, rapidly spinning gyroscopes are perfectly happy and well-behaved with any movement along that axis, or relocation of that axis which remains exactly parallel to its original orientation during such movement or at its new location. Most of those technically savvy people above have had the opportunity to play with a toy gyroscope and have forced the gyroscope’s spin-axis to accept an angular change and have thus, directly experienced a phenomenon called “precession,” which resists that applied force with a force of its own and of proportional intensity.\n\nGyroscopes are used primarily in guidance instruments and/or controls in moving vehicles, for example, gyroscopic compasses. In a much more limited range of application, and at a much larger physical size, they also serve as dampers to counter such unwanted oscillations as “roll” of a ship. Ever since the end of WWII and the entrance of the V2 rocket, and then spacecraft, not only has their sophistication and accuracy increased exponentially, but entirely new, equivalent technologies have entered the field, primarily in lock-step with that of other oscillation-based electronic equipment; e.g. Royal Rife’s electronically controlled microscope system.\n\nThe speaker has devoted a sizable part of his discretionary lifetime conceiving, building, and experimenting with unique gyroscopic systems, that are quite robust, and in some cases, quite powerful. He now views, as indigenous, the relationship between the behavior of flywheel-type gyroscopes and most other physical phenomena. As he sees it, forced deviation from the natural precessional behavior of flywheel-type gyroscopic systems is identical to the motion fundamentals imbedded in other natural, physical phenomena, i.e. electron spin motion in atoms, DNA spirals, weather, cosmological phenomena, and oscillating motion in numerous other examples in physics.\n\nThese arc-motion fundamentals exist in the mechanical distillations derived from over 25 physical experiments including: pulsed anti-gravity; spiral motion; motoring by both natural and powered precession; motion reversals; pendulum-tuned motoring; extremely rapid linear motion; a visual-mechanical demonstration of inertia; etc.\n\nThe four basic, matter-building-block motions are: orbits, translations of orbits, rotation of the spin-plane, and powered, precession-formed spirals.

Dmitriyeva1,2, R. Cantwell2, M. McConnel2, and G. Moddel1 \n1 Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder\n2 Coolescence LLC,  Boulder, CO,  U.S.A.\n\nExperiments in low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR), which used to be referred to as cold fusion, have been reported for liquid electrolyte (the Pons-Fleischmann effect) and gas phase systems. Many laboratories have observed excess heat in these systems and interpreted this as evidence for nuclear reactions. We have replicated and carefully analyzed the results of gas phase reactions. In the experiments reported here, we examined whether conventional heat- generation processes and measurement artifacts could account for at least some of these observations.\n\nWe carried out an experimental study of excess heat production during hydrogen and deuterium loading of Pd-, Pt-, and Ni-enriched material. Earlier studies have shown that a conventional hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) chemical exchange reaction in water can account for at least some of excess heat observed during gas-loading experiments. We have found that metal in its nanoparticle form catalyzes H/D exchange reactions in the material and produces heat that might be mistaken for a nuclear reaction. That excess heat can be eliminated by prebaking the material in vacuum at 390oC, thereby removing residual water. We also studied the influence of temperature gradients on heat measurements. The presence of gas changes drastically the heat conduction inside the vessel. Therefore, when under pressure, the heat transfer efficiency changes. This change in heat transfer in the presence of temperature gradients artificially shifts the temperature measurement baseline, which could be mistaken for excess heating. We suggest it is crucial to test the measurement system with inert gas to eliminate potential measurement errors induced by temperature gradients.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The current theoretical understanding based on high temperature fusion does not envision such a possibility. The treatise Basic Structures of Matter–Supergravitation Unified Theory is based on an original model of the physical vacuum containing underlying superfine material structure with node elements held by Supergravitational (SG) forces that are inversely proportional to a cube of the distance. At distances below 1 angstrom, the SG forces appear as strong nuclear forces, while at larger distances they conform to Newtonian gravity.\n\nAmongst the major outcomes are the revealed material structures and shape of the stable elementary particles that build the atomic nuclei. The protons and neutrons are not spherical but have the shape of a twisted and folded torus, respectively. Held by the strong nuclear forces, they form atomic nuclei as fractal three-dimensional structures. Such nuclear models exhibit an excellent match to the pattern of the Periodic Table, showing signatures of valences, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and angular restrictions of the chemical bonds. The Coulomb barrier for these models does not converge to the small size predicted by the Bohr nuclear model, so it is not so strong. It depends on nuclear orientation and it could be modified by some technical methods. The analysis of some successful cold fusion experiments resulted in practical considerations for modification of the Coulomb barrier. \n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

More recently Pd-D co-deposition has been reported by Mosier-Boss et al. in 2007 and 2009 in order to generate charged particles. In this work a CR-39, a solid-state particle detector, is used to record evidence of charged particles. We have used these techniques as well as electronic detectors to look for charged particles emitted during Pd-D co-deposition. We examined whether conventional processes might account for some of the charged particle observations.\n\nThe earlier work suggests anomalous nuclear products are responsible for tracks observed on CR-39 detectors. CR-39 pits similar to those reported by Mosier-Boss et al. were found using both in situ CR-39 and Mylar-protected CR-39. However, CR-39 protected by a combination of Mylar and a small air gap did not show any pits. The electrolyte, as its chemistry changes during the electrolysis, is shown to damage the acrylic cell containing the experiment and to damage an aluminum foil separated from the electrolyte by a Mylar film. This damage together with the absence of pits when a small air gap is added to the Mylar protection suggests chemical reactions may be the source of the observed CR-39 pits. The absence of any detected charged particles using a YAP:Ce scintillation detector further supports the conclusion.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Most such studies presume a fairly \"lean\" mix in which antiprotons comprising a small fraction of the total fuel mass undergo annihilation in more complex nuclei, heating the fuel mixture to temperatures at which the exhaust velocity will be a significant fraction of c. The simple proton-antiproton annihilation reaction seems unsuited to such applications since a majority of the energy in this reaction ultimately emerges in the form of neutrinos, which cannot readily be manipulated for thrust. However, this objection disappears if the proton-antiproton pair is accelerated to relativistic velocity before annihilation. Assuming the non-neutrino reaction products are captured and reprocessed for energy, the drag suffered from this capture will be less than the thrust applied to the initial pair, the remaining momentum being carried away by the neutrinos. The recoverable energy can be used to accelerate the next pair, leading to a closed-cycle process which generates thrust without requiring an exhaust port or producing a visible plume of reaction products. The fuel efficiency will depend on the proportion of the intermediate reaction products that have time to decay to neutrinos, which will in turn depend on the length of free path available for these reaction products to decay. Implications of this fuel and drive system for the hypothesis that some UFOs are ETI spacecraft are discussed. A direct empirical test of this hypothesis may be achievable by comparing the direction of observed UFO maneuvers with the locations and observation records of neutrino telescopes which have been operating for several decades.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Despite this hostility, the reality is that the increasing sophistication and power of parapsychological experiments has recently reached the point where these experiments can be used to test important aspects of physical theory. Two important areas of unresolved theoretical speculation in physics are addressed by parapsychological results published in the last three years.\n\nThe quantum measurement problem has been one of the fundamental mysteries of physics since the development of quantum mechanics. The many disparate \"interpretations\" of quantum mechanics are spawned by our essential ignorance regarding such basic questions as what constitutes a measurement and what actually happens during a measurement. In 2008 Dean Radin of the Institute of Noetic Sciences published experimental results showing that a particular state of focused attention could function as a measuring instrument, to the extent that it could be detected by its effects on quantum interference. The existence of a \"measuring instrument\" that consists solely of a human mind has the potential to resolve many issues regarding the proper role of consciousness in interpretations of quantum mechanics. Accomplishing this resolution, however, would require many more experiments of the Radin type to establish the limits and properties of the phenomenon.\n\nRetrocausation has been of concern in physics since the appearance of advanced waves in the equations of classical electrodynamics, and began to be taken very seriously with the discovering of metrics in general relativity that allow the existence of closed timelike curves. In 1989 Echeverria, Klinkhammer, and Thorne (EKT) established that spacetimes with closed timelike curves do not generate time paradoxes. Their physical model leads to predictions for the behavior of any system containing retrocausal effects, including those where only information rather than a physical artifact moves from future to past. In 2011 Daryl Bem of Cornell published a series of experiments in presentiment which appear to be the first parapsychological experiments both sufficiently robust and appropriately designed to offer a direct test of the existence of the EKT mechanism. If such a test produced positive results, a secondary consequence more interesting to consciousness researchers than to physicists would be a demonstration that micro-PK is an inevitable consequence of the existence of precognition or presentiment, through a physical mechanism completely unrelated to the DAT hypothesis published in JSE in the 1990s.\n\nYork Dobyns holds a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University.

This author holds that, like conventional phenomena, all anomalies of the natural world should also have common physical basis that unifies a variety of abnormal phenomena. Generally, the anomalies of the natural world include the following phenomena: strong and weak interaction, the origin of the universe, black holes, the special life phenomena of the human body (including parapsychological phenomena and paraphysiological phenomena), and UFOs. To this goal, the volume field model about strong interaction and weak interaction was proposed by the author in several conferences and journals in last three years. The volume field model can be stated as: volume field (corresponding to particle) is a form of material existence in plane space (corresponding to point space), it takes volume-change motion (or volume motion for short, corresponding to displacement motion) in the form of non-continuous motion (or pulsation, corresponding to continuous motion),\nvolume fields have strong interaction or weak interaction between them by overlapping their volume fields (corresponding to exchanging intermediate particles). Last talk in 2015 SSE conference, the author discussed the issues of material existence of volume field (the complex structure of atomic nucleus and living body), this talk will be given in mathematics by focusing on the kinematics of volume field. Like particle, which has duality of wave and particle, in volume field model volume field also has duality of pulsation and volume motion. In addition, as the mathematic basis of volume field model, this author will introduce the model of plane space and the model of periodic jump function at the beginning of talk.\n\nBio: Rongwu Liu graduated from department of physics of Qufu Normal University, China, had been a physics teacher in China.

Einstein called it “a black box, and you can’t get in.” But stunning and unexpected findings of recent neurological research conducted at the University of Michigan, combined with modest inferences drawn from logic and our own incorrigible personal experience, suggest new perspectives on the process of death — in particular, whether experience persists beyond the time at which neural activity ceases irrevocably. NDE (near-death experience) research is primarily anecdotal and first-person, relying on the testimony of those who have narrowly escaped death, but this is third-person research involving multiple species and objective measurement using EEG (and EKG) measurements. The findings document the extent of neural activity during the instant just prior to brain death, when the brain undergoes what can be called the “brain flash” — a highly coherent, highly comprehensive, highly transitory state at the theta wavelength, peaking into the gamma, the function of which is presently unknown.\n\nThis presentation offers a hypothesis about what may be happening when each of us undergoes the “brain flash”, and explores whether this phenomenon, common to mice, humans, and presumably everyone in between, may be the tip of an iceberg pointing toward experience beyond the death of the physical brain. How, for example, is this penultimate function passed on in the process of biological evolution, given that by definition there is no opportunity to reproduce before brain death? Is there a dimension of evolution that parallels Darwinian dynamics involving the non-physical components of consciousness?

Upon studying thousands of cases of paranormal phenomena across the world and throughout centuries, such as out-of-body experiences (OBEs), remote viewing, near-death experiences (NDEs) and others, it becomes imperative to design and incorporate new research methods to study such occurrences. Thus, this work introduces the consciential paradigm, and the methodology of researching consciousness also through subjective experiences (the development of ones own skills for producing paranormal events), or 1st person research; and the interpersonal experiences (measuring and developing in other individuals their own abilities to promote such anomalous events).\n\nThe universality of several paranormal phenomena will be presented, including the broad range of cultures, countries, religions and schools of thought which have reported these phenomena and developed methods for their production. Phenomena, in which, individual consciousnesses have a manifestation outside the current boundaries of their physical body. Just like microbes could not be directly observed before the invention of the microscope, there is currently no physical technology to detect what appear to be a non-physical consciousness. Therefore, a new paradigm, called the consciential paradigm, for the study and understanding of these events is needed.\n\nIn this work, several types of current 1st person research methodologies will be presented, where individuals develop their own skills and become both the subject and the researcher of the phenomena produced. As the number of cases from different individuals accumulates, consensus and refutation among these researchers allows for more solid conclusions and cross-verifications. Likewise, techniques for the production of paranormal phenomena can also be taught to other individuals, and their progress can be tracked by senior researchers. Helping in the consensus and the refinement of the methods. Furthermore, this work will also present new and 3rd person research initiatives with more classic instruments and methods, including studies using fMRI and double-blind experiments. These 3rd person experiments have already yielded positive and promising results which support the 1st and 2nd perspective research.\n\nThese 3-pronged approach (subjective, intersubjective, and objective) towards the study of consciousness aims to further the understanding of Reality, without limiting it unnecessarily to only the 3rd person perspective.\n\nBio: Luis Minero graduated in Chemistry with honors and the author of the book “Demystifying the Out-of-Body Experience”.

It was written from the perspective of experiencers (myself and my husband). During our numerous accounts of different types, intensities, states and rates of out of body experiences, we were able to observe, explore as well as research the main traits and characteristics of the expanded consciousness. The paper summarizes results of our subjective experience of out of body states. It introduces a new approach of researching out of body experiences based on direct know how, mastery and first hand observation by experiencers themselves.\n\nThe paper focuses on description of out of body experiences mainly of my husband Michael, who has been having spontaneous out of body experiences (while fully awake) since birth and has experienced the so called conscious birth. The paper presents a portion of a fascinating true story of a man (Michael) living outside his body for over 40 years. It includes authentic extra corporeal experiences of the protagonist, who remembers his birth and his death. Michael also remembers the whole prenatal stage, having been in his mother’s uterus as developing embryo, and the exact instance his vibratory oscillating quantum of light energy (aka Soul/Spirit body) entered his mother’s uterus and into the fetus (which later became his future physical body). Michael is different from others in that that he literally lives his life outside his body, and is able to leave the physical body (without the help of artificial induction) to travel interdimensionally, while staying fully aware.\n\nOver the last 20 years I have been compiling characteristics (typology) of out of body experiences as featured in my paper. This comprehensive report is solely based on my own out of body experiences (have experienced my first OBE in 1995), observation of out of body states\nof my husband who is an experiencer since birth and has been undergoing significant OBEs for the last 40+ years and testimonies of private clients of mine who themselves are experiencers as well as participants of the lectures, speeches, and workshops on OBEs, I have been conducting in Europe. Special attention in the paper is given to the fact that out of body experiences were identified as one of the main experiences pertaining to encounters with NHI (non human intelligence) as recently pointed out by excellent research carried out by the FREE foundation. To sump up, the paper offers a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the nature of mainly spontaneous (versus artificially induced) out of body experiences as experienced by Michael and me.\n\nPaper describes in extraordinary detail how out of body state is perceived from the perspective of its connection to the 5 traditional human senses and how the heightened intensity of the traditional senses as well as nontraditional senses such as direct inner vibrational cognition or molecular transformation operate in the etherical body during the out of body state including the multidimensional perspective. Information contained in this work both on personal as well as general level is conducive on many different perspectives including the true nature of human awareness as well as human consciousness operation under its expanded mode outside the boundaries of the body. Furthermore, the paper argues that out of body experience does not require special conditions such as sleep, near death experience, extreme physical effort, or induction (mental, mechanical or chemical) to occur. Rejection of subjective experience is quite strong in mainstream science. Therefore examining the insights of subjective experience will greatly contribute to strengthening of holistic approach both in the OBEs as well as the consciousness study in general.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration conference at Yale University, 2017.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

How diverse health effects are produced by downstream consequences of this mechanism.\nMartin Pall\n\n26 different studies have each shown that microwave/ lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce biological effects via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Forces of such EMFs on the voltage sensor controlling the VGCCs are approximately 7.2 million times stronger than the forces on singly charged groups in the aqueous phases of the cell. This predicts, in turn, that the current safety guidelines allow us to be exposed to EMFs that are approximately 7.2 million times too high.\n\nThe downstream effects of VGCC activation act via elevated nitric oxide signaling, peroxynitrite/free radical effects and excessive [Ca2+]i signaling produce the various well documented effects of EMF exposure including: Oxidative stress; cellular DNA damage; cancer; massive impacts of the brain leading to widespread neuropsychiatric effects; changes in endocrine (hormone) effects; lowered male and female fertility, increased spontaneous abortion; cardiac effects including arrhythmias, tachycardia, bradycardia and heart palpitations; melatonin depletion and sleep deprivation; EHS; breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The extraordinary cellular DNA damage produced by cell phone-like pulsed microwave EMF exposures (Schwarz et al) as compared with that produced by ionizing radiation can be understood as being due to the three levels of amplification leading from VGCC activation to free radical production with the free radicals producing, in turn, the DNA damage. The industry propaganda claim that ionizing radiation is dangerous but non-ionizing radiation is not, is exactly opposite from the actual findings on cellular DNA damage!\n\nFive worse case scenarios are discussed. Ever increasing EMF exposures are predicted to lead to a crash in human reproduction; DNA damage in germ line cells are producing large mutational increases; widespread neuropsychiatric effects will become increasingly severe; VGCC activation, known to cause the changes in synaptic development and function, will produce increasingly common autism in future generations; the known role of excessive [Ca2+]i in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases may be the the primary cause of circa age 30 dementias and may be leading to very large increases in very early onset dementias. Combined effects of these may be expected produce massive impacts on human populations.\n\nBio: Martin L.

Every cell in our body is bathed in an external and internal environment of fluctuating invisible magnetic forces that can affect virtually every cell and circuit in biological systems. Numerous physiological rhythms and global collective behaviors can become synchronized with solar and geomagnetic activity and disruptions in these fields can create adverse effects on human health and behavior. The most likely mechanism for explaining how solar and geomagnetic influences affect human health and behavior are a coupling between the human nervous system and resonating geomagnetic frequencies (Alven Waves), and resonances in the earth-ionosphere resonant cavity (Schumann resonances) and other very low frequency waves.\n\nThe Global Coherence Initiative (GCI) was launched by the Institute of HeartMath in 2008. GCI has designed and is installing a Global Coherence Monitoring System at strategic locations around the planet to measure the fluctuations and resonances in the earth’s magnetic fields to conduct research on the mechanisms of how the earth’s fields affect mental and emotional processes, health, collective behavior and social unrest. This globally connected network of GPS time stamped detectors continuously measures magnetic signals that occur in the same range as human physiological frequencies such as the brain and cardiovascular systems. Each site includes a random number generator (RNG) that is part of the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) network.\n\nThis presentation will report on a collaborative study with the Prince Sultan Cardiac Center in Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia where we obtained a total of 960 24-hour heart rate variability (HRV) recordings from a group of 16 women (mean age 31, 24-49) over a five month period between March and August of 2012. The solar activity and magnetic variables were: solar wind speed, Kp and Ap index, PC(N), sunspot number, solar radio flux (f10.7), cosmic rays, Schumann resonance integral (area under the curve around 7.8 Hz) and the mean and Standard Deviation (SD) of the time varying magnetic field data collected at the GCI sites located in Boulder Creek, CA and Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor each of the study participants, a correlation matrix was calculated between each environmental and HRV variable. Overall, the study strongly confirms that autonomic nervous system activity is affected by solar and geomagnetic influences. All of the HRV measures, with the exception of IBIs, were negatively correlated with solar wind speed and some measures were negatively correlated with the magnetic field data from the local site in Saudi Arabia, but not the site in California, suggesting that local measurements are important. Surprisingly, there were also a number of positive correlations. For example, the f10.7, cosmic rays and Schumann resonance power was positively correlated with a number of increases in HRV variables. Although there were a number of global correlations, at the individual level, the HRV responses varied and in some cases different individuals showed different responses to the same environmental variable.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Such longitudinal (or scalar) fields can be experimentally generated by exciting longitudinal vibration modes or by the use of self-cancelling coils. The latter includes the use of toroidal and caduceus coils (which are geometrically related). These studies indicate that longitudinal fields can be considered non-classical, since they do not obey Maxwell’s laws. Recently Barrett has reformulated Maxwell’s equations [U(1) symmetry–based] to account for the observed anomalous behavior of transverse EM fields under special conditions. The modified equations, based on non-Abelian algebra, characterizes longitudinal EM fields of SU(2) symmetry.\n\nPropagation of longitudinal fields is described in various biological systems (bone, cochlear tissue, etc.), where these fields have been postulated to mediate growth processes. Preliminary studies by Flannigan, Smith, and Ho suggested that biological systems also respond to longitudinal EM fields when applied exogenously. However, relatively little is known about their mechanism of action.\n\nIn this presentation, the biological effects were determined by measuring the growth of human lymphocytes in tissue culture. Growth was determined using state-of-the-art biochemical techniques involving the incorporation of (3H)-thymidine (1.0 μCi/ml) into replicating DNA. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity in the DNA fraction 12 hours after four 15-minute treatments over a 12-hour treatment period. In some experiments, interleukin-2 (IL-2) (25U/ml), a standard mitogen for lymphocytes, was added to the culture medium immediately prior to the 12-hour EM treatment period. Control cultures received no EM treatments.\n\nLongitudinal fields were generated using a specially designed caduceus coil predicted to emit a combination of transverse (classical) and longitudinal (non-classical) EM fields. The caduceus coil was fed with a complex square wave composed of frequencies expected to stimulate the immune system. Near-field transverse EM measurements were used to characterize the EM fields generated by this caduceus coil. A magnetometer was constructed using a Technics T-1050 high pass coil detector connected to a Spectral Dynamics SD-335 spectrum analyzer and a HP 181TR oscilloscope.\n\nThe results indicate that longitudinal EM fields generated from the caduceus coil have a very marked stimulatory effect on the growth of human lymphocytes (p = 0.001), much larger than previously reported for classical, transverse EM fields. A similar effect was observed with IL-2, but there was no additivity or synergism when the mitogen was combined with the EM fields. This suggests that these energetic and chemical signals stimulate cell proliferation by similar mechanisms. EM measurements indicated the presence of a weak (1.5 G) transverse EM field with the anomalous appearance of new frequencies not present in the current fed into the caduceus coil. It is presently unclear whether the unusually large stimulatory effect on lymphocyte proliferation is due to an optimal combination of transverse and longitudinal EM fields or a highly effective set of frequencies generated by the fields emitted from the caduceus coil.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

It’s been nearly a century since investigators have had the opportunity to carefully study standard spiritistic phenomena, including the extruding of ectoplasm, and the FEG is the only current physical mediumistic circle permitting any serious controls.\n\nAt last year’s SSE conference I reported the progressively stringent séances I supervised with the FEG, culminating in some very careful experiments with video documentation in a secure and private location in Austria belonging to one of the investigators. These latter séances yielded videos of a full table levitation, and also the medium apparently extruding a large quantity of ectoplasm from his mouth, which then accumulated in an apparently animated heap on the floor in front of him. The ectoplasm was produced despite numerous controls, including a careful strip search of the medium, examination of the medium’s clothes, and inspection of the cabinet in which he sat.\n\nRecently, evidence has surfaced from séances other than those I’ve conducted suggesting strongly that the FEG medium, Kai Muegge, may have resorted to fraud on several of those occasions. Although this has clearly tarnished the case as a whole, it remains unclear whether (or to what extent) the hypothesis of fraud can be deployed successfully with respect to all the FEG phenomena, and my investigations in particular. Thus, it remains unclear whether Kai’s mediumship deserves being classified charitably as a case of “mixed” mediumship (combining both fraudulent and genuine phenomena). By contrast, in several other, well-known, cases of mixed mediumship—for example that of Eusapia Palladino, some phenomena seem quite clearly to be genuine. However, that conclusion is warranted because Palladino (and others) produced phenomena under much more stringent controls than Kai Muegge has so far allowed.\nIn this talk I’ll summarize the arguments both for and against the paranormality of the FEG phenomena generally, and I’ll discuss what steps Kai must take to dispel the cloud of suspicion currently hanging over all his phenomena.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The Information, Operation, and Application research programs examine (i) the accuracy of the information mediums report; (ii) the mediums’ phenomenology, physiology, and psychology, and (iii) the potential social applications of mediumship readings, respectively. Studying mediums’ physiology as part of the Operation research program may help in predicting, preventing, and/or managing medical issues in mediums. An informal survey of the current team of Windbridge Certified Research Mediums (WCRMs) regarding their health issues demonstrated that chronic medical problems may be a serious concern for this population. For example, this sample has seven times the incidence of autoimmune disorders compared to the incidence in the general US population. Their incidence of diabetes is nearly twice the national prevalence. And the incidence of migraines in female WCRMs is nearly two and a half times the prevalence in women in the US. The current study aimed to systematically investigate the biological components of anomalous information reception (AIR; the reporting of accurate and specific information about the deceased in the absence of prior knowledge, feedback, or deceptive means) in this population of mediums by examining general physiological measures and 33 hematological elements during mediumship readings and a control task. Data collected to date do not demonstrate any significant changes in these measures when pre- and post-condition comparisons were made for the counter-balanced sessions. These preliminary results imply that the mediumship process itself may not be responsible for the increased health issues in this population. An alternative model addressing the relationships among childhood trauma, dissociation, and physical illness is proposed.\n\nJulie Beischel, Ph.D., received her doctorate in Pharmacology and Toxicology with a minor in Microbiology and Immunology from the University of Arizona in 2003.

Emmons","description":"Phenomenological and Objective Methods in Consciousness Research: The Case of Spirit Mediumship\nCharles F. Emmons\n\nResearch by parapsychologists and others into consciousness and survival has involved a variety of scientific methods, most of which have tested claims of alleged phenomena such as ESP, NDEs, reincarnation and spirit mediumship by a process of elimination through mundane explanations. In the case of spirit mediumship, spontaneous and semi- controlled readings have been examined for fraud and information leakage through a kind of detective work. Also, Gary Schwartz, a psychologist, has managed to test spirit mediums in the laboratory using a series of protocols continually refined to prevent communication by normal means. Important evidential cases survive the tests, but possible mechanisms for the phenomenon remain largely unexplained except by various theories of hidden order that are consistent with the evidence.\n\nBy contrast, sociologists may use methods of studying spirit mediums hip that focus on the perspectives of the participants. Participant observation and ethnographic interviews help reveal the social context and the personal meaning of mediumship for mediums and their clients. Listening to the mediums’ own explanations of how they do what they do represents a phenomenological approach. In addition, the researcher can take on the role of spirit medium, thus engaging in “participatory science,” in order to bridge the gap between an objective and a subjective understanding of the phenomenon.\n\nIn terms of the sociology of knowledge, such methods present a dilemma for those engaged in investigations at the edge of normal science. Examples of how objective and subjective methods can be combined to yield potentially greater insight are presented in this paper.\n\nCharles F.

One of the main survival research methods involves studying mediums-individuals who report regular communication with the deceased. The current ongoing study addresses the research question at the heart of mediumship research: Can mediums report accurate and specific information about the deceased loved ones (termed discarnates) of living people (termed sitters) using anomalous information reception; that is, without any prior knowledge about the discarnates or sitters, in the absence of any feedback, and without using deceptive means? In order to control for all traditional, local, and sensory explanations for the accuracy of the mediums' statements (e.g., cold-reading, cueing, generality, rater bias, fraud), Windbridge Certified Research Mediums (WCRMs) answer specific questions about discarnates during readings performed under quintuple-blind conditions which involve the blinding of the mediums, the sitter-raters, and three experimenters interacting with the participants at various stages of the study. In addition, the WCRMs are not provided with feedback about the scores sitter-raters give the readings in order to address precognition as an explanation for positive results. The item-by- item and whole reading scoring data collected to date as well as the implications of the findings regarding the relationship between the mind and the body will be discussed.\n\nJulie Beischel, PhD, is Director of Research at the Windbridge Institute for Applied Research in Human Potential ( www.windbridge.org).

Though formulated distantly in time from each other, each in its own way has come to some strikingly similar discoveries and theories.\n\nOne of these Eastern science traditions, Kashmir Shaivism, is of particular interest to Western science. Among the most valuable contributions to developing insights into phenomena studied by Western science is the conceptualization of universal manifestation. Within it is a potential wealth of scientific insight. It describes in detail how a totally vibrational universe manifests into apparent physicality.\n\nThis model of the manifestation of the universe sheds light on phenomena beyond space and time, such as discovered in Western research on UFO’s and REG’s. It also illustrates parallels to quantum physics concepts such as the nature of sub-atomic particles/waves. Quantum processes involved in producing large amounts of energy and new sub-atomic particles have parallels here, as well.\n\nYet another important concept, holography, is represented in the manifestation model. This is reflected in the notion that human beings are holograms of the universe. Inherent in both the universe and humankind is not only the involutionary action that leads to manifestation, but also (and perhaps even more importantly) an evolutionary action to promote higher states of consciousness. Although this aspect of the model is profound within itself, it, too, has implications for contemporary Western science research. For example, the concept of transformation of energy is addressed, and along with it, the notion that when a measurement is taken may mean the difference between measuring one type of energy, or a completely different kind.\n\nThe parallels demonstrated serve to illustrate the potential value of the study of Eastern science traditions in furthering the pursuits of Western science. These tenets have obvious implications for the understanding of higher states of consciousness and evolution, both universal as well as human.\n\nDr. Syldona's interdisciplinary background encompasses engineering, psychology, Eastern science traditions, electrophysiology and education.

Both took seriously the view that there is more to reality than the physical universe and more to consciousness than simply brain activity. In his Science and the Unseen World (1929) Eddington speculated about a spiritual world and that \"conscious is not wholly, nor even primarily a device for receiving sense impressions.\" Jeans also speculated on the existence of a universal mind and a non-mechanical reality, writing in his The Mysterious Universe (1932) \"Š the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.\"\n\nIn his book QED Feynman discusses the situation of photons being partially transmitted and partially reflected by a sheet of glass: reflection amounting to four percent. In other words one out of every 25 photons will be reflected on average, and this holds true even for a \"one at a time\" flux. The four percent cannot be explained by statistical differences of the photons (they are identical) nor by random variations in the glass. Something is \"telling\" every 25th photon on average that it should be reflected back instead of being transmitted.\n\nOther quantum experiments lead to similar paradoxes. To explain how a single photon in the two- slit experiment can \"know\" whether there is one slit or two, Hawking and Mlodonow write:\n“In the double-slit experiment Feynman's ideas mean the particles take paths that thread through the first slit, back out though the second slit, and then through the first again; paths that visit the restaurant that serves that great curried shrimp, and then circle Jupiter a few times before heading home; even paths that go across the universe and back. This, in Feynman's view, explains how the particle acquires the information about which slits are open.”\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more absurd physical explanation. We can think of no way to hardwire the behavior of photons in the glass reflection or the two-slit experiments into a physical law. On the other hand, writing a software algorithm that would yield the desired result is really simple.\nA digital reality whose laws are software is an idea that has started to gain traction in large part thanks to an influential paper in Philosophical Quarterly by Oxford professor Nick Bostrom.\n\nWriting in the New York Times John Tierney had this to say:\n\n“Until I talked to Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University it never occurred to me that our universe might be somebody else's hobby. But now it seems quite possible. In fact, if you accept a pretty reasonable assumption of Dr. Bostrom's, it is almost a mathematical certainty that we are living in someone else's computer simulation.”\n\nInstead of a future simulation nerd, I suggest that there exists a great consciousness whose mind is the hardware, and whose thoughts are the software creating a virtual universe in which we as beings of consciousness live.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Amidst this, science has become a guiding influence in the formation of prefabricated reality.\n\nIn practical terms, what matters to most people is the maintenance of this mindset as it provides meaning and a sense of belonging. On the good side, this mindset gives us advances in healthcare, corporations able to provide trustworthy products no matter where you are in the world, models of education that serve to elevate one and all, and the protocols of science that usher us to new learning. We also find, however, that practices of healthcare lead to injury, corporate life shuns the individual, standardized education dampens innovative thinking, and what is considered to be not scientific is cast aside with prejudice.\n\nEven with these few examples, we’re looking at a dynamic that speaks directly to how humans organize their perception of reality, and live their lives. For this presentation, the placebo effect serves to illustrate the interplay of the bureaucratic mind in healthcare and science. And the connecting link for all aspects of bureaucratic-related behavior is education, the how and what of learning.\n\nEven those who see themselves as being not of the crowd may be unwittingly part of consensus reality. The next understanding of life beyond the bureaucratic mind may not be relief from its influence, but living a more complex level of the same.

Clinical parapsychology will first be considered in regards to the author’s clinical psychological work where “the paranormal is normal”, namely at Manawanui, a Māori Mental Health Service in Auckland. The official health model of Manawanui is based on the sacred building called the Marae. The model is called in Māori Te Whare Tapa Wha, namely the house of wellbeing, which is represented by the four sides of tinana (body), whanau (family), hinengaro (mind), wairua (spirit). For wellbeing to be achieved, all four principles of this model for the client (tangata whai i te ora) needs to be addressed.\n\nAfter highlighting the importance of wairua in this indigenous mental health model, specific Mate Māori (specific Māori illnesses) recognized by tohungas will be discussed, such as matakite, makutu, mauri, etc. This will be related to a model of voice hearing when working with psychosis and ancestors (tupuna), as well as considering diffierential diagosis of mental health and spiritual emergency.\n\nThe author’s own shamanic training as a sangoma in South Africa becomes relevant at this point. In regards to the tradition of becoming a sangoma, the ukuthwasa, the apprenticeship is often defined by complex relation between psi effects, altered states of consciousness, exceptional experiences, and mental health. A dialectical approach to the complex relationship between spirituality and mental health distress will be presented.\n\nSpecific and integrative psychotherapeutic and shamanic clinical vignettes with clients will be outlined to highlight interventions such as mentalization in terms of paranoia and witchcraft, seeing the ancestors and emotional regulation, or determining the cultural trauma of exceptional experiences in regards to psychosis or voice hearing. Some psychoanalytic considerations will be considered in regards to wairua, or ‘spiritual holding’.\n\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

While ongoing research at the Institute on the nature of different states of consciousness is yielding rich insights into human development, a continuing challenge for the leadership of TMI is to understand how repeated exposure to Hemi-Sync® technology in controlled workshop environments affects the quality of individual lives. Does repeated exposure to TMI programs increase the capacity of the participants to deal with the demands of their lives in terms of doing meaningful work, developing and supporting mutually rewarding relationships, and in acquiring skills and attitudes that provoke continual growth and development?\n\nAnalysis of responses from more than 700 TMI program participants to demographic, psychographic (including personality typology), and program effect items demonstrated statistically significant differences in self-efficacy and life satisfaction between those having only attended the initial program – Gateway Voyage – and those attending 3 or more programs.\nThe findings indicate that individuals choosing to attend TMI have a predilection for transformational growth – the radical, vertical leaps in being as opposed to the less risky, more pragmatic, horizontal extensions of being. A challenge of this orientation is finding effective means for managing the tension between what is and what could be. To look too closely for too long at the limitations in “the way things are”, particularly when tolerance is low to begin with based on personality typology, can create bruised sensitivities, alienation, and despair. In effect, why would people with this orientation find much to be happy about?\n\nBased on the statistical analysis which clearly indicates respondents who have attended multiple programs have a higher degree of self-efficacy and life satisfaction, the answer to the question of happiness could be a state of ego development beyond self-authoring; a movement towards what Robert Kegan calls self-transforming. The results of this study indicates a group of individuals who recognize the limitations in any perspective and more willingly engage others for the challenge it poses to their worldview as the means for growing more expansive in their experiences – to consciously grow beyond where they are rather than merely having it happen to them as a function of circumstances.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The different stages of training will be compared and presented as a platform to show many similarities and one glaring difference. Indigenous shamanic healers practice healing in the community where they trained where the allopath has no overall sense of community. In order to highlight this comparison, medical students at the University of Arizona in an Integrative Medicine rotation were evaluated after being exposed to Huichol healing traditions in the high desert of Sedona, Arizona.\n\nSeventy-two hours of working with healing and fire ceremonies, smudging, and open dialogue with ancestors, brought students closer to their reasons for entering medical practice. Students claimed the exposure to these indigenous ceremonies and spending increased time with their colleagues in this setting instilled them with a sense of increased community and they felt more energized about the sacred calling to heal. The students also felt more connected to their bodies and their senses of hearing and touch were subjectively elevated. In conclusion, exposure to indigenous methods of healing might bring the allopath back to their calling to enter medicine and allow them increased connection to the community of patients they treat.\n\nThe call to heal comes from the familial bonds of the shaman-physician, healing vocation, or from wounds of the past. In any case, it is the spiritual glue that provides physicians with the ability to become healers. The continuation of spirituality in medicine is a critical conduit to healing the physician. Inner healing of the physician is an important aspect of bridging the gap towards healing the community. Shamanic practice is a potential first step in bridging the gap between the wounded healer and the disembodied local and global communities.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

In childhood and early adolescence, as the biological or physical development completes itself, the mind simultaneously goes through its own developmental stages, and seems to play a part in overall human developmental stages. After these milestones are reached, in essence, human development is considered to be basically complete, and less research has typically been done at this point of seeming completion. Therefore less is known about human development beyond the mental (supra-mental), and beyond the primarily biological development that occurs in the earlier years of life. As a result, relatively little is known in Western culture about the stages and states of adulthood and their possible effects on health and well-being. Gaining greater scientific understanding of both ordinary and atypical adult developmental processes and their effects on this growing adult population may be one of the greatest and most important challenges of the century.\n\nThe British Royal Academy recently called for interdisciplinary collaboration between the sciences and humanities in an effort to understand major paradigmatic challenges. Consideration of cross-cultural traditions and sciences in service of solving these challenges could prove fruitful as well. With respect to adult development and well-being in many other cultures, the ‘elders’ are those who are in possession of many of the kinds of ‘anomalous abilities’ studied by, or of interest to, SSE members. Many of them are the ‘seers,’ the ‘healers,’ those that know the science of influencing the weather, or possess other non-ordinary talents. These cultures all have an understanding of some supra-mental, psychology cosmology, or psychospiritual aspect inherent in human beings that manifests frequently in adulthood, or advanced adulthood.\n\nResearch integrating tenets of Eastern psychospiritual traditions and Western science could also be of value in facing the challenges of promoting health and well-being in adult development. Such integration provided the basis for a study of healing meditation states that produced data of real-time dynamic fluctuations in DC potential measurements. It was hypothesized that bioelectricity, as DC potential current measurements, taken from on and off acupuncture points is both a direct and an indirect measure of prana (chi). Anomalous data from an adult subject who reported spontaneous experiences that met traditional criteria for a Kundalini experience is presented. According to Eastern science traditions, Kundalini processes represent the stage of adulthood, accompanied by the potential for supra-mental or psychospiritual development. The DC potential data taken during this event exhibit an anomalous pattern compared to others obtained in this study, and also appear to corroborate descriptions in Yogic sciences of energy-based phenomena which can take place during Kundalini activation. The results likely represent an electrophysiological signature of Kundalini activity. Since the apparently anomalous data fit the theory which accounts for this data, it serves to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nBio: Dr. Syldona’s interdisciplinary background encompasses science, engineering, psychology, education, and Eastern psychospiritual traditions, at institutions including: Carnegie-Mellon, Stanford, and Brown Universities and SUNY Stonybrook.

Several new psychological and behavioral treatments (mirror boxes) that have proven more effective have been explained by invoking neural plasticity as their mechanism of action. Other novel treatments that are based on an “energy medicine” model also appear to be quite effective, including Therapeutic Touch and Energy Psychology (EFT, aka “tapping”). These approaches address the psychological trauma of the amputation itself, a factor that is generally overlooked in the standard surgical approach to limb amputation.\n\nA speculative trauma/energy model for the etiology of PLP is proposed, based on the so-called “phantom leaf effect”. According to this model, the phantom limb is not a hallucinatory construct of the cerebral cortex, but is an independently existing physical phenomenon. Several methods for detecting this energy field complex will be described, along with the strengths and weakness of each approach: manual palpation, Polycontrast Interference Photography (PIP), Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV), and Kirlian photography. The model’s utility in explaining several anomalous aspects of PLP, as well as the clinical efficacy of energy therapies, is outlined. This model is proposed as a step in the development of simple and effective energy/trauma treatment protocols for this widespread and largely treatment-resistant disorder.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration conference at Yale University, 2017\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Lyke","description":"Not Everyone Gets Machine Elves: The Nature of Discarnate Entities and Their Interactions with DMT Users\nJennifer A. Lyke\nStockton University, Galloway, NJ, USA\n\nEncounters with entities are one of the defining characteristics of the DMT “breakthrough” experience. Several authors have described general categories of entities that are frequently encountered under the influence of hallucinogens (e.g., Luke, 2011; Shanon, 2002) and Terence McKenna popularized the “self-transforming machine elves” as one of the hallmarks specifically associated with DMT (McKenna, 1982). However, to date there are few empirical investigations of the characteristics of DMT entities or their interactions with DMT users. Accordingly, this study investigated the frequency with which DMT users experience various categories of entities and the nature of the interactions users have with these entities during the drug experience.\n\nContent analysis was performed on 149 trip reports posted from 2006 through 2015 on Erowid.com by DMT users (90% male, average age 24.6) in order to characterize users’ descriptions of the entities as well as the nature of their interactions with them. Entities were defined as elements of the experience that appeared to the DMT user to possess independent awareness. Seventy-five percent of reports included a description of at least one form of entity and 37% described more than one entity. There were a total of 180 experiences of entities reported. The general categories of entities that emerged were poorly defined or formless beings (29%); humanoid beings (22%); divine beings (10%); aliens (8%), elves and fairies (7%); animals (6%); geometric objects or machines (6%); voices (4%); faces (4%); and miscellaneous entities that did not fit into the other categories (3%).\n\nThe gender of the entities also emerged as an important characteristic as it was specifically mentioned in 24% of the descriptions of entities. Male participants were significantly more likely to report the gender of entities than were female participants, and entities whose gender was specified were significantly more likely to be female than male.\n\nThe general nature of the participants’ interactions with the entities was also explored. The categories of interactions that emerged were showing/teaching/guidance (25%), no interaction (10%), hostility (10%), warmth or love (9%), welcome/excitement (9%), reassurance or encouragement (8%), neutrality or observation (7%), play or entertainment (4%), power or control (3%), sexuality (3%), unclear interactions (3%), questioning (3%), reminding (2%), and miscellaneous interactions that did not fit into the other categories (2%).\n\nTo investigate whether there were any systematic relationships between entity categories and the nature of interactions, the five most common entity categories were evaluated in terms of their association with the five most common categories of interaction. No systematic relationship emerged for any category of entity. Similarly, there was no significant pattern of interaction category for entities that were specifically identified as female C2.\n\nThese results indicate that the most commonly experienced, well-defined entities are humanoid and that the most frequent category of interaction involves showing, teaching, or guidance. However, there is no significant relationship between entity category and the nature of the interaction. The results will be compared to previous research on DMT entities, entities encountered using other psychedelic drugs, and entities experienced in alien abduction experiences, near death experiences, and mental mediumship. Limitations of the research design will be discussed along with psychological and psychophysiological interpretations of the results.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nSupport the SSE's commitment to open access content at: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=23234339\n\nOr take your support of our 501(c)(3) nonprofit even further by  becoming an SSE member: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

In other words, if abductions represent real events, they should not favor any particular human-inhabited geographical area. In this regard, France could pose a crucial test, since it has lots of ufologists but (apparently) not many abductions. A recent talk presented in July 2014 at a CNRS conference reflected on this scarcity. By contrast, some American researchers believe that abductions are not rare in the USA, and may be as frequent as one in fifty persons (or even more common). Are Americans simply more suggestible?\n\nThe number of recognized abductions that one would expect, however, depends critically on the model of reporting that one chooses. The usual model is a “percolation” one. In the percolation model, the known “hidden events” are simply a constant fraction of the total [real] hidden events, and they percolate upward into social consciousness at a constant rate. In reality a constant rate is extremely unlikely. The rate of reporting, the rate of transmission of reports, and the rate of publication of transmitted reports are all variable parameters. They dynamically respond to the “demand conditions” operating at various levels in society. For instance, in reporting of the “battered child syndrome” percolation previous to the controversy transmitted merely hundreds of reports to police and hospitals. After social awareness was aroused, and channels for reporting were created, the numbers of battered children appeared to be in the hundreds of thousands. Similar remarks could be made about the ostensible number Catholic priests sexually abusing children in the USA, and how it depended on changing media attention, thus altering reporting and publication parameters.\n\nTherefore, a second “interactive” model needs to be invoked. In the case of the USA, several authors wrote abduction books and carried out extensive radio and television interviews. These books and interviews led ostensible “abductees” to contact and write letters to the authors, which were used in turn as ammunition to swell the database, made the phenomenon seem more real, and in turn more “reportable.” As far as I can tell, however, nothing similar happened in France. There were no local abduction experts who wrote books, few American experts appeared on French media, and therefore there has been little encouragement for reporting by potential French abductees. This in spite of Jacobs’ book (and others) being translated into French. So the “demand conditions” for abduction reporting do not exist in France. The only way this question can be resolved is by direct inquiry (e.g. surveys) in France itself.\n\nProf. Ron Westrum [B.A. Harvard (honors) 1966 (Social Relations); Ph.D. University Chicago 1972 (Sociology)] is emeritus Professor of Sociology, Eastern Michigan University, where he has taught for 42 years, in addition to visiting positions at the Universities of Edinburgh, Hawaii, and Stavanger (Norway).

Peter Resta \n\nSo-called alien abduction syndrome (AAS) has been studied by a variety of academic scholars, including from Harvard University (e.g., Susan Clancy, Ph.D., and the late John Mack, M.D.). Similarly, it has been discussed in several scholarly publications (including in a book published by the APA), and the focus of empirical research which has been presented in such journals as the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. AAS has been linked with a host of possible explanatory factors, including sleep paralysis, fantasy prone personality, dissociative reactions, and false memory syndrome (to name a few). The precise mechanism(s) which satisfactorily and conclusively explain AAS are elusive, however, and often equivocal or speculative. This presentation will examine some of the explanations which have been proffered for AAS, with particular attention paid to the role that hysteria may be playing with the phenomenon. The possibility of veridicality will also be incorporated in the presentation.\n\nS.

And while the list of basic research questions regarding anomalous healing remains inexhaustible, current research also includes the question of whether the healing effect can be “captured” and “reproduced” without the healer. In other words, can we store and independently deliver healing in a practical fashion? Selected current research on whether biological systems can recognize “stored” healing will be presented, along with work designed to test whether “recordings” of healing potential can bring about healing outcomes.\n\nSarah Beseme discusses the effect of audio recordings of energy healing activity on cancer cells. Recordings were played to the cells from 30 min to 2 days and genomics studies were performed to identify genes that are affected by the recordings. The focus was on genes involved in cancer pathways or in cancer inflammation. Results to date indicate the possibility that the recordings may have an effect on genes involved in apoptosis, which is the process of programmed and controlled cell death that occurs naturally.

The major difference between the concepts in modern conventional science and radiesthesia is the human element. In the latter, the human body is considered an instrument and a critical component.\n\nRadiesthesia comes from the Latin word radius, or ray, and the Greek word aesthesis or sensitivity. It can be traced back to 6,000 BC in China, Europe, and Egypt. While the general population was taught how to use dowsing rods, the knowledge of the science of Radiesthesia using the pendulum was limited to special individuals, priests, or top leaders. To acquire this knowledge was to develop the human mind, body, heart, and soul, in a way that established direct connection with the Universe or the Divine.\n\nRadiesthesia is based on the concept that all things, living, inert, shapes, materials, etc. emit some type of wave form, or frequencies. Humans can develop their sensory with their mental capacities to learn, by using intention, how to enter into resonance with the different waves or rays in order to detect, measure, and manage these forces or energies. It is believed that the Egyptians used Radiesthesia to build their pyramids.\n\nFor thousands of years, knowledge of Radiesthesia was passed on by word-of-mouth and as the modern world evolved into the more mechanistic and industrial epoch, the concepts of the ancient science were ignored. Still today mechanistic scientists scoff at using the human being as an instrument because they have difficulty proving, through conventional instruments and research designs, that this human potential exists. The problem is that conventional scientific instruments and research designs were not created to explore the nonlocal realm.\n\nIn the 1940s, two French colleagues, de Belizal, a physician, and Chaumery, an engineer, rediscovered the lost knowledge while visiting the Pyramids in Egypt. They dedicated years researching the different invisible rays and frequencies, seeking scientific explanations. One of their findings was a specific ray emitting energy of a negative electric green frequency which the Egyptians used to mummify and protect the tombs from intruders. While conducting experiments with this ray, Chaumery died of over-exposure.\n\nSome European surgeons realized, with good training in Radiesthesia, that they could accurately identify the ideal spot to make a surgical incision; but they were quickly thrown out of the medical profession. In the 1990s Professor Etienne Guille (PhD in physio-biochemistry) from the University of Paris conducted research on DNA using Radiesthesia and published his findings in the book Vibrational Language of Life. Homeopaths in the early 1900s used Radiesthesia for diagnoses and tailoring the dosages for each individual. The applications of this science are limited only by our creativity on how to use it.\n\nThis lecture will explain the concepts of Radiesthesia and how the training to learn this science taps into an area of human potential that is being overlooked today.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Kautz","description":"Extension of Modern Science to Enable Research on Anomalies\nWilliam H. Kautz \n\nThe primary contemporary challenge to research on anomalistic phenomena arises from the now well-confirmed presence of the human mind in an increasing number of laboratory experiments and natural observations — in direct contradiction with materialistic science’s inability to either account for or explain them. These limitations arise mainly from the root metaphysical assumptions that govern all scientific exploration of the natural world, for they disallow subjective or non-reductionistic participation, among others.\n\nIf science is ever to embrace and explain these and similar contradictions, it must somehow be extended to allow new ways of exploring, verifying, and explaining how human consciousness interacts with natural phenomena, yet without losing its essential features of open inquiry, critical assessment, and public validation. SSE’s membership, representing today’s leading-edge research, has the opportunity to lead this effort.\n\nOne possible extension is to employ the mind deliberately to generate new information. This very common practice is ordinarily too unreliable as scientific methodology. It should now be reconsidered for enhancing the discovery stage of scientific inquiry, before verification is undertaken.\n\nRecognized mental means for obtaining unique information — clairvoyance, mediumship, divination, dreams, etc. — are manifestations of intuition (Greek nous), meaning innate access to knowledge apart from the senses, rational thought, and ordinary memory. That this capacity exists in humans can no longer be questioned, though it is seldom accurate and trustworthy. When so-called expert intuitives, who have trained themselves to be responsible sources, are interviewed under a controlled, multi-intuitive, and consensual protocol, however, they can provide substantial information subsequently verifiable as accurate, detailed, new, and almost error-free. Hundreds of examples in a dozen different disciplines demonstrate that this “other way of knowing” is ready for immediate practical application to the solution of scientific problems. This methodology and several illustrative examples are described.\n\nWilliam H. Kautz, Sc.D., was formerly Staff Scientist at SRI International, working in the emerging field of computer science and in geophysics and the social sciences. He later founded and directed the Center for Applied Intuition, which carried out research, training, consulting, counseling, and public education on intuition and its applications. He is widely published.\n\nRecorded at the 34th annual SSE Conference  in 2015 at the Hilton Washington DC/Rockville hotel.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Machine learning algorithms iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find connections in data without the need for them to be explicitly programmed. The past few years have brought major advancements to the field of machine learning, including new developments in deep learning (the implementation of complex, multilayered neural networks) and advanced applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, medical diagnosis, user preferences, and image recognition and feature extraction. In addition, many of the companies and universities that are driving this development effort have started to release their machine learning tools as either low cost or open source software. Google, Inc.’s TensorFlow, IBM’s Watson, and Microsoft’s Computational Network Toolkit along with a wide range of powerful APIs (application program interfaces) now make machine learning highly accessible. With these new tools come new potential methods for examining psi-related data sets. In a recent exploratory study, machine vision recognition software was used to classify and extract details from a set of images that were created from random event generator (REG) data that were collected from 10 sessions in which meditators focused on feelings of “Love” (five sessions) and “Hate” (five sessions). The data, collected using FieldREG software (Psyleron, Inc.), were then processed though Windbridge Institute custom visualization software that converted them into complex 3D images. \n\nTraditionally, FieldREG data are analyzed by looking for deviations from randomness; however, the current exploratory study employed image concept recognition software (Clarifai, Inc.) to classify the images based on their visual attributes. While there was considerable overlap in the resulting classifications, the software successfully grouped four of the five “Hate” images together with a unique descriptor not found in any of the other images, nor previously considered by the investigator. What is notable here is that the software made this test possible with just a few hours of investigator time in contrast to previous image classification approaches which would have required a specifically defined classification scale and a large number of research participants. The results of this exploratory study demonstrate the potential value in the application of machine learning to visual data sets both in terms of time/cost efficiency but also in potential hypothesis generation. As machine learning systems can quickly find connections in data that humans cannot, applying them to psi datasets may produce new, testable hypotheses which could profoundly move the field forward.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

These classes, Technology and Human Life, and Understanding Technology, are lower division University courses. In the first we consider the social, ethical and legal issues with developing technology and in the second, just understanding how current technology works. Many of my students are married with families and work full time in technology related vocations. They tend to be very pragmatic.\n\nI only discuss in class, PSI related science that is backed up by good statistics. During one session, a crusty construction fellow inquired, “What’s the Point?” He expressed the feeling of many that things like Premonitions, Remove Viewing, Telekinesis, Telepathy, and others, have no practical value and may not even be real. We have, I think, a responsibility to develop and communicate how these phenomena can be useful to society.\n\nIn that regard, this presentation will show how Premonitions and possibly some other phenomena are vital in the Reliability and Safety aspects of Aviation and other safety critical vocations including operating room personnel, ship bridge crews and industrial plant employees. One vital process for these people and indeed, even all of us, is Situational Awareness, or knowing what is going on around us. Early work in this area was done by Dr. Robert Helmreich at the University of Texas Psychology Department (ret) under a NASA contract. Training in this area is required by the FAA for all commercial aviation crews and has been found extremely valuable in many other areas.\n\nWe teach how to recognize when Situational Awareness is being lost, using 11 clues to losing it. One of these is the presence of a gut feeling that something is wrong. This is a good definition of a premonition. We will discuss how this relates to the other clues and how there may be some other PSI phenomena operating in conjunction. Some examples of this in actual operations will be given. Some rationales for ignoring such warnings will be explored.\n\nJohn MacLean was born in a coal camp ghost town in Utah and grew up in Sheridan, Wyoming.

Gupta","description":"Effects of Bioelectromagnetic Energy on Okra Yields Using Thought Transaction\nVijay K. Gupta\n\nA scientific paradigm shift to replace the existing chemical and biotechnological agricultural practices worldwide is the need of the moment. Evidence of harmful effects of current agriculture on people and the environment is mounting. In our research, the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides is eliminated, while more than doubling the crop yield. It demonstrates the feasibility to address the global crisis emerging from food shortages for a growing population.\n\nWell-established ancient practices of India for cultivation and good harvest honored sun, soil, rain, seeds, and cows as an integral part of farming, and used Panchagavya, a product derived from cow’s milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine. Panchagavya contains micronutrients, carotenoids, flavones, phenolic compounds, steroids, and vitamins to enhance plant growth. We investigated these ancient practices on okra yield (Abelmoschus esculentus .L) within a modern scientific framework at the VMKYKK Research Foundation, Aliyar, Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe overarching hypothesis of our research is that plants respond to electromagnetic energy as an external stimulus. Bose (1919) conducted experiments on the response of plants to external electromagnetic stimuli. Quoting Bose, “the growing plants not only perceive but respond to the stimulus of electrical waves. These effects were found in all growing plants.” Waechter (2002) reviewed extensive literature and hypothesized that “Qi energy and the Western scientific concept of ... bioelectromagnetic (BioEM) energy is the same phenomenon. The countless similarities ... suggest ... that these two concepts are ... intimately related”. He further stated that “As one enters a meditative state ... the frequency of brain wave drops ..., and that BioEM field extends beyond the physical boundaries of the body into the surrounding space.” We hypothesize that BioEM energy is projected through thoughts, which Rajendran et al. (2003) supported. They conducted a laboratory experiment using thought transaction in low mental frequencies on tomato plants. Their observations showed major resistance against root knot nematodes.\n\nWe systematically investigated the effect of thought transaction in low mental frequencies and Panchagavya in two plots. In the first, two-minute and five-minute thoughts were given every morning for the wellness of the crop and good yield. A control set was used against which to compare yields. The experiment lasted for 60 days. Panchagavya treatment was given as 3% spray at 10-day intervals. A second experiment was repeated with only thought transaction, excluding Panchagavya. Yield data were analyzed statistically.\n\nResults of both the experiments showed that plants responded exceedingly well to BioEM energy using thought transaction. Okra yield increased by 121% over the control set. Panchagavya alone by comparison was found to enhance the yield by 68%. There is no significant difference between combination of thought transaction with and without Panchagavya. Our findings demonstrate that environmental pollution and health hazards can be avoided, and crop yield doubled, by adopting ancient practices that are modernized and scientifically validated.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

How can individuals experience psi dreams? How can psi dreaming be researched and evaluated scientifically? What can we do with psi dreaming? How can psi dreaming be understood relative to other forms of psi, such as remote viewing and some types of intuition?\n\nThis workshop is an opportunity to discover the application potential of psi dreaming. Guidelines for performing psi dream research and strategies that facilitate psi dreaming are provided with methods for evaluating psi dreams from a scientific perspective. A variety of psi dream research results show evidence for the reality of psi dreaming. Independent psi dream investigations and validated spontaneous psi dreams illustrate the utility and limitations of psi dreaming. Potential concepts on how psi dreaming occurs and how psi dream imagery is constructed and interpreted will be explored. Exercises to assist in dream recall are practiced during the workshop. A psi dreaming experiment for a designated picture will be available during the conference with results reviewed during the Friday workshop. Recommendations on how to achieve a psi dream for the target picture will be provided during the first day of the conference on June 20.\n\nFacilitator: Dale E. Graff, M.S.

Kautz","description":"Intuitive Methods in Support of a New Science and its Associated Societal Paradigm \nWilliam H. Kautz\n\nModern science has unquestionably been an immense boon to the expansion of human knowledge, the development of civilization and creation of the current societal paradigm. However, it is now apparent that it suffers from severe shortcomings which are blocking its application to the study of the human mind, mind-related fields generally. and even fundamental physics and biology. The pressure to transcend these limitations is calling for major changes in the way science must be carried out and applied. In this presentation I identify these specific shortcomings and explain which of them which might be circumvented, which disregarded, and which modified to meet the emerging need for a new and more broadly inclusive science.\n\nPrimary to this trend is the need for another way of acquiring knowledge besides the traditional methodology of experimentation, deduction, analysis, hypothesizing, and verification. In 1978 to 1993 the author’s Center for Applied Intuition carried out a series of experiments to elicit, from a team of highly skilled intuitive individuals, new and useful information that had not been obtainable scientifically. Employing the method of intuitive consensus—which employs a set of skilled intuitives in a special inquiry mode—three knowledge-bound areas (among others) were explored: earthquake triggering, bipolar (manic) depression, and HIV/AIDS. Abundant new and detailed information was obtained. Later examination (2011) of these intuitive findings revealed that they corresponded very well with results from mainstream research over the intervening years. They showed that intuitive consensus has a significant potential for generating totally new information, ideas, perspectives, and hypotheses in almost any scientific area which is held up by a lack of knowledge. This method and the conditions for conducting future intuitive inquiries successfully, along with the implications for changes to modern science and the current societal paradigm, are described.\n\nBio: William H. Kautz, Sc.D. M.I.T. ’51, conducted basic and applied research in computer science and geophysics at SRI International (Stanford Research Institute) for thirty-five years, eventually as Staff Scientist.

Now, 35 years later, I propose we look at portal areas as a focus of scientific study. Portal areas in the United States and elsewhere display a variety of reported anomalous events. It is this variety of anomalous events that is intriguing and I believe, unexplained. The Reservation, in addition to UFOs, had strange aerial balls of light, bigfoot sightings, “stick Indians” and much more. Its variety of well-documented anomalous events is matched by similar areas in southwest Pennsylvania and the San Luis Valley, which includes parts of Colorado and New Mexico. “Portal areas” will do for a working concept, but I am not sure these areas contain doors to elsewhere, though it is interesting to think so.\n\nBut what accounts for the variety? That is the key question. Are UFOs, for instance, the hallmark of some larger process that also brings in, say, bigfoot, or cattle mutilations? What is this larger process? Have these weird events always been in these areas? The notes and tapes from\nYakima sat in my files for years, unresolved, until I began to appreciate that the other two areas offered similar assortments (with lots of commonality), and so the “portal area” concept began to gather force. One interesting feature is that information about these areas tends to circulate locally but not, say, nationally. So there is no pressure to resolve what is certainly a mystery. Yet the “odd stuff” is not random, and so there must be an explanation for at least some of it. \n\nPersonally, I don’t find the “earthlight theory” involving geological fields of force persuasive. Something paranormal going on here, but what is it? How does it operate? We tend to think of paranormal forces operating on a micro, or personal level, but what if they operate on a “macro” level, involving hundreds of square kilometers, as well? The “Skinwalker ranch” is obviously a small-scale version of this, but the other three examples are much larger scale.\n\nBio: Ron Westrum, Ph.D, is emeritus professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan University, and specializes in organizational information flow.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration conference at Yale University, 2017\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Davis\nCenter for Information and Communication Sciences\nBall State University, Muncie, IN, USA\n\nUnidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been of considerable interest throughout the world for over half a century, especially with the prospect that UFOs defying worldly explanation would most likely be associated with highly advanced extraterrestrials (ETs), which, if confirmed, would undoubtedly have major implications on society. Yet, in order to confirm or deny this ET hypothesis, or a non-ET hypothesis involving a highly strange physical phenomenon, UFO data needs to be useful for scientific research. The usefulness of such data has been criticized by some scientists, such as Jacques Vallee, PhD, who has done prominent work on unidentified aerial phenomena and computer science. And this relates to the increasing prominence of “big data,” since various UFO databases exhibit the key characteristics of big data: high volume, variety, and velocity. The main purpose of this paper is to help make UFO data useful for scientific research through an approach that considers a layered data model by Jacques Vallee and Eric Davis in studying anomalous phenomenon, in conjunction with networked storage and analytical processes associated with big data.

Hastings","description":"Unexplained Aerial Incursions at Nuclear Weapons Sites Demand a Renewed Scientific Interest in the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe UFO-Nukes Connection is now thoroughly documented. Declassified U.S. government files establish a convincing, ongoing pattern of UFO activity at American nuclear weapons sites extending back to December 1948.\n\nI have interviewed more than 130 U.S. military veterans—including ICBM launch and targeting officers—regarding their involvement in nuclear weapons–related UFO incidents. Seven of these individuals—former U.S. Air Force officers, including a deputy base commander— appeared at my September 27, 2010, press conference in Washington, DC, which CNN streamed live (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUU4Z8QdHI). The veterans report extraordinary encounters which have obvious national security implications. More to the point, implicit in these revelations are potentially paradigm-altering repercussions.\n\nThe events divulged leave little doubt that the U.S. nuclear weapons program is an ongoing source of interest to someone possessing vastly superior technology. Moreover, declassified KGB documents and testimony from ex–Soviet Army personnel suggest that similar incidents occurred in the former U.S.S.R. Consequently, it appears as if an as-yet-unidentified third party has interjected itself into the six-decade nuclear arms standoff in a most startling and provocative manner.\n\nAs revealed at the press conference, incidents occurred in 1967 during which significant numbers of ICBMs malfunctioned just as security personnel reported disc-shaped craft silently hovering above them. In another case, in 1980, a disc was observed to direct laser-like beams into the largest U.S. nuclear weapons depot in Europe. To dismiss these Air Force officers’ detailed accounts as mere fantasies or fabrications is to suggest that those who held the fate of the entire planet in their hands during the Cold War were dangerously demented or otherwise untrustworthy. Surely, this was not the case.\n\nWhile this research material does not qualify as scientific data per se, the statements offered by these ex-military sources make abundantly clear the need for a fresh, unbiased scientific study of the UFO subject. Indeed, the late atmospheric physicist Dr. James McDonald—one of only a handful of scientists to have actually studied UFOs—advocated a renewed examination of the phenomenon decades ago. After several authorized visits to the U.S. Air Force’s UFO Project Blue Book to review its sighting reports, he wrote, “There are hundreds of good cases in the Air Force files that should have led to top-level scientific scrutiny of the problem years ago, yet these cases have been swept under the rug in a most disturbing way by Project Blue Book investigators and their consultants.”\n\nIn a prepared statement delivered to the U.S. Congress’ House Committee on Science and Astronautics on July 29, 1968, McDonald said, “My own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that UFOs are probably extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that might very tentatively be termed ‘surveillance.’” Documents and witness testimony which have become available long after McDonald’s death strongly suggest this hypothesis has merit and that the superpowers’ nuclear weapons were one target of that ongoing surveillance during the Cold War era.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This author happens to have obtained two documents on original paper, thereby permitting the use of forensic techniques for dating.\n\nOne document is entitled “An Encyclopaedia of Flying Saucers”, written by New Yorker Vernon Bowen in the mid 1950s and subsequently lent to the military allegedly for review and approval prior to publication. It was returned from an Army FOI (Freedom of Information) office at Fort Meade, Maryland to a mailbox in 1999, and was classified either Confidential or Top Secret/Majic on pages dealing with the Air Force. In addition, numerous pen and pencil notations were made on the original pages, and these have been dated according to first available use of the inks involved. Several of the handwritten notes strongly support the hypothesis of a strong, sophisticated program to study UFOs and to be kept from the public.\n\nA second document, called “The Burned Memo” because there are clear burn marks evident where it was apparently pulled from a fire, identifies a number of code word projects from the Nixon era, some of which are known and now unclassified and some of which are unknown and possibly still classified. The inferences of keeping JFK and the public in the dark about these programs are, if true, discomfiting. Each of the eight tab pages will be discussed. Some of the projects mentioned seem to deal with consciousness research.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation of the two “original- paper” documents strongly supports the hypothesis that there was a high level UFO research or control program called MJ-12 using the code word Majic.\n\nRecorded at the 27th annual SSE Conference in 2008 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Alexander","description":"UFOs: The Good News and the Bad News \nJohn B. Alexander\n\nThis presentation addresses both the overwhelming evidence supporting the physical reality of UFOs and how institutions respond. A central thesis is that the U.S. Government is not involved in UFO research. That statement is made after many years of direct involvement in the field and attempts to interest various organizations in conducting appropriate studies. This includes firsthand experience in briefing senior leaders in many governmental and civilian industrial organizations.\n\nIncluded in the presentation is a description of activities designed to create Congressional Hearings on the topic. While there was such a proposal from a Congressman in position to initiate hearings, powerful opposing forces were encountered. However, once the UFO proponent group, The Disclosure Project, held their noisy accusations at the National Press Club in Washington in 2001, all existing support quickly dissipated.\n\nAddressed are the basic problems in reasoning espoused by many UFO enthusiasts. Most pronounced is their inability to distinguish between the personal interests of government employees and official organizational involvement in the topic. There are many people in government positions that have had personal observations of UFOs. That, however, does not translate into official programs based on established requirements to either collect data or conduct research on the topic. Despite extensive evidence of national security implications from UFO interactions, and dangers to commercial aircraft, there is a total lack of institutional support for research. Given the severe budgetary constraints imposed by the war in Iraq, propensity for new research is likely to get worse.

The same concept, however, can be applied to less well-quantified situations. The only essential requirement for such a semi-quantitative approach is that it must be possible to identify distinct hypotheses as being either more or less likely than others. If, at every possible decision point in a hypothesis evaluation, one chooses the formulation that is more likely than every competing alternative, one will emerge with the most likely hypothesis, even if the degree of relative likelihood is impossible to evaluate.\n\nA popular hypothesis, frequently examined by numerous SSE members, is that Earth has been (and perhaps is being) visited by spacecraft containing extra-terrestrial intelligences (ETI). The primary evidence presented in favor of this hypothesis consists of eyewitness reports, and occasional corroboration such as photographs or instrument records, of objects that appear to be artificial vehicles and cannot be identified with any known human vehicles or technology. A subset of this witness testimony and other documentation indicates that at least some of these vehicles seem to have occupants, usually approximately humanoid, who are able to operate (possibly with protection) in a human-compatible environment as regards temperature, atmospheric chemistry, gravitation, and so forth.\n\nThe current presentation does not attempt to evaluate the quality of this body of evidence but simply stipulates its existence and attempts to construct a maximum likelihood version of an ETI model consistent with observation. Evaluation of likelihood is based on the premise that what is known to be possible is more likely that what has merely not yet been proven impossible. Thus, for example, technologies already implemented by human beings are more likely than technologies based on known physics but not yet successfully implemented by humans, and these in turn are more likely than technologies based on speculative physics not yet confirmed to be real. Similar, though looser, constraints apply in other sciences such as biology. Background knowledge, such as the fact that we are not presently engaged in widely known, public communication with any ETI species, will sometimes be invoked as well.\n\nThe conclusions can be summarized briefly by saying that the ETI model of highest likelihood, given the data, is that a substantial ETI civilization is present in the Solar System exploiting deep-space resources (such as minerals in the asteroid belt and volatiles in the Kuiper belt) in ways we have not yet managed to observe. Inferences from this basic model include the conclusions that the main civilization is deliberately pursuing a policy of concealment (perhaps not primarily from us) and those individuals who have allowed their vehicles or even themselves to be observed by humans have been violating the behavioral norms of their culture of origin.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

They, too, are open systems “far from equilibrium,” which are characterized by alternative steady-states and chaotic sensitivity to initial conditions. In living systems, that sensitivity may go down to the quantum level, amplifying, for example, changes in the conformation of proteins or microtubule states that are best described in terms of the indeterministic collapse or decoherence of wave functions. Is it possible that in certain living systems, alternative biological states are somehow represented in wave functions and conscious choice is reflected in the collapse of those wave functions, iteratively favoring the preferred biological state? Evolution would then have selected for those electromagnetic configurations that could exploit the contributions of conscious decision-making to biological self-organization. This paper explores this possibility seriously, as an hypothesis that could be further developed and potentially tested in collaborative research that integrates areas of neuroscience, complexity theory, evolutionary biology, subtle energies research, and quantum theory. We consider, specifically, how electromagnetic oscillations associated with alternative biological states may have an organizing effect on vacuum fluctuations, setting up wave functions that represent these alternatives as options for conscious consideration; and how conscious choice among these options may have “entangled” consequences at disparate physiological locations that iteratively favor the chosen state. If such “bio- quantum computing” does occur, the difference between life and other electromagnetic systems, such as atoms and molecules, may be a difference of degree rather than a difference of kind, implying the pre-adaptation of the universe for conscious life, as well as the possible consciousness of the universe itself.\n\nLarry Goldberg is a philosopher of science, environment, and mind who has applied his interdisciplinary methodology to program development at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and the University of California, San Diego; Texas A & M University; the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and the Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Health Sciences campuses of the University of Colorado.

The Copenhagen Interpretation, based on the dual-reality complementary paradigm of Bohr and Heisenberg, asserts that no quantum reality exists, only quantum measurement through classical apparatus. Measurement collapses the wave-function to the values observed by conscious observers. For Everett, the Copenhagen interpretation is too heavily based on classical physics: it was not a truly independent scientific theory nor an answer to the measurement problem of how quantum microscopic and macroscopic phenomena interact. Specifically, Copenhagen doesn’t adequately answer the question of how classical phenomena arise from quantum processes. Why does the world appear a particular way to each unique observer who himself is also a quantum system that obeys the laws of the Schrodinger equation? Why doesn’t the world look completely “smeared out” instead of definitive and exact?\n\nFor Everett, quantum entanglement is happening continuously everywhere. It does not need any special treatment or observation by external observers. What appears to be collapse is, in fact, the subjective loss of information to the observer. Instead, our awareness multiplies with each successive observation creating a continuously, infinitely branching tree-like structure of observers in separate worlds which never interact. Though shunned by most physicists at the time, the Many Worlds viewpoint, as developed later by Bryce Seligman DeWitt and others, has become an increasingly popular view in recent decades as expounded by Deutsch, Tegmark, Carroll, and others. In this talk, I will look at the implications of the Many Worlds view for so-called “paranormal phenomena” such as clairvoyance and remote viewing, PK, ghosts, and UFOs and show why these phenomena could be seen as quite “ordinary” from a many-worlds perspective. Specifically, I will look at a new incarnation of the Many Worlds paradigm, the Many Interacting Worlds (MIW) idea as espoused by Wiseman and Deckert. MIW theory claims that classical forces in atomic structures create subtle repulsive interactions: what appear to be quantum wave functions are merely the resonant epiphenomenon of the classical interference patterns between parallel dimensions. Specifically, MIW claims that exactly 41 parallel realities could explain the wave function of a single photon and hence, the double-slit experiment. Critics contend that both MWI and MIW are unfalsifiable, yet perhaps the abundance of paranormal phenomena may illustrate that near- parallel realities do indeed exist and interact with our own.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

They each counted coincidence measurements on entangled polarized photons from a common source. Our presentation begins with a brief discussion of the quantum mechanics of polarized photons. We show an example of the changes in the count rates when the polarizers are changed under assumptions of local causality. This causes a contradiction with quantum mechanical predictions. The example uses a logical flow and the algebra of inequalities. It constitutes a conditional proof of the Bell inequality.

A physical interpretation is given with the following consequences: 1) Any action or measurement by an observer is treated as “imagining the future possible outcomes of the system” and writing the state of the system in an orthonormal basis composed of those outcomes, and 2) the singular values σi of ‘A’ weight the possible outcomes and represent the level of expectation that the experimenter has that the state “i” will occur. As a consequence of this interpretation, the observer’s action on and beliefs/expectations of the system determine the set of available outcomes and bias the system toward a particular outcome. This may provide a useful model for understanding psi experiments in the literature. For instance, with regards to experiments by both Radin and Bem, the possible influence of experimenter expectations described above may provide an explanation for both a variance in the data over time, as well as the difficulty for some parties (but not others) to replicate the results.\n\nJustification will be briefly made (in reference to previous papers) for why these results may apply to macroscopic situations as well. It will be suggested that, if the result above is true, effects such as these may have consequences for addressing real world societal problems, such as climate change. In the macroscopic domain, this described effect would appear as the occurrence of ‘synchronistic’ or meaningful connections within seemingly random events. The effect would bring the observer a greater-than-chance possibility of fulfilling her expectations about everyday events. This would have consequences both positive and negative for human experience. For instance, an individual who believes that challenges such as global climate change are solvable will be more likely to run across coincidences which help her be successful in her attempts to find solutions. Conversely, an individual who thinks the solutions are too difficult or too expensive will find equal appearance of synchronicity to confirm her beliefs. One could reasonably extrapolate that the effect may happen not only at an individual level, but also for collective groups of individuals, bringing about collective meaningful coincidences.\n\nIn conclusion, it will be suggested that if the proposition is confirmed to be correct then there is an urgent need for more understanding of this issue not only among intellectual circles but among the general public, for our collective beliefs would potentially have an impact on our collective future.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Williams","description":"Quantum Mechanics, Metaphysics, and Bohm’s Implicate Order [SSE]\nGeorge R. Williams\n\nQuantum mechanics has provided a successful framework for describing the behavior of the subatomic world. However its ontological interpretation remains mysterious. Alternative interpretations include aspects of our reality existing in quantum superposition prior to measurement (Copenhagen) or splitting into multiple separate realities (Everett). Quantum mechanics also challenges our metaphysical notions or underlying assumptions about reality. The best-known example, perhaps, is the nonlocality between subatomic particles that has been experimentally confirmed. Einstein and his colleagues vigorously argued that quantum mechanics violates locality and therefore had to be incomplete. However, nonlocality was confirmed to be an intrinsic aspect of quantum mechanics.\n\nThis historical debate on nonlocality raises the question of what role metaphysical assumptions play among competing interpretations. Another class of quantum mechanical interpretations seeks description of reality more congruent with our experience, yet via sharper deviations in our underlying metaphysical assumptions. Bohm introduced his guidance equation to provide an interpretation for quantum mechanics that allowed particles to have definite location and trajectory. However Bohm achieved this by positing that the movement of particles depended on the configuration space, whose dimensionality is three times the number of particles in the universe. Bohm’s approach suggests that we can perhaps achieve an ontology that is congruent with classical physics through a quantum potential function that is inherently nonlocal and holistic. While most physicists have not followed Bohm’s approach, some find its ontology more appealing than the alternatives. A key question arises, however, is what are the implications of the fact that the quantum waveform operates in a high dimensional (configuration) space. What is this high-dimensional space about? Some have argued that this high dimensional space is real and represents a more fundamental level of reality.\n\nBohm’s later work proposed that this high-dimensional space of the waveform represents a more fundamental level of reality, an implicate order, which is the foundation for both consciousness and matter. Few physicists or philosophers have been willing to take this step, primarily because of the generally accepted assumption that consciousness supervenes on matter. However the arguments of Chalmers and other philosophers of mind imply that consciousness probably does not emerge from matter. Also the work of Tonini has illustrated that subjective experience seems to require an extraordinary amount of information and dimensions. Thus a framework that takes the high dimensionality of the waveform as real and foundational for both matter and consciousness appears to be a viable alternative, not just a solution for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, but the hard problem of consciousness as well.\n\nAnother important advantage of this approach is that it provides a framework that is consistent with the psi literature. Bohm’s implicate order, existing as a proto-conscious, nonlocal potentia, can provide promising explanations for such psi categories as clairvoyance, precognition, and mind-matter interaction. Thus Bohm’s implicate order, while radical in some respects, distinguishes itself from other interpretations of quantum mechanics through its implications for empirical testing.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

It is based on the new concept of a Generalised Quantum Theory (GQT) (Atmanspacher, Römer & Walach 2000) that also predicts Generalised Entanglement (GET) correlations. Meanwhile there is experimental support for the model.\n\nMethod: A meta-experiment has been developed by Walter von Lucadou with three positive experimental realizations that has now been replicated independently two times. It uses a random number generator that drives a fractal display. Voluntary participants are seated in front of the computer with the instruction to “influence the direction the fractal grows or shrinks using their intention or will only”. An experiment consists of 9 runs with 3 different instructions to shrink or grow the fractal, or keep it stable. The experiment is moved forward by key-presses. Out of this set-up 5*9 (45) physical variables are created and 5*9 (45) psychological variables. These 45*45 variables are correlated across all experiments, yielding a correlation matrix with 2025 cells. The theoretical prediction is that there will be more correlations visible than expected by chance or in the control matrix, and that in replications the correlations will swap places across cells, but will, overall, stay significantly visible. A control matrix is also constructed out of an empty run of the system and the psychological variables of a predecessor experiment. The statistical evaluation follows a classical approach using the differences in the number of correlations in both matrices and calculating a z-score, and a Monte-Carlo-simulation using 10.000 simulated runs.\n\nResults: Two independent experiments with 100 to 200 participants each have been conducted up to now, and a large multi-center experiment is under way. The two experiments confirm independently that in the experimental matrix there are more correlations than should be expected by chance or than there are in the control matrix. A more conservative simulation analysis confirms the results with z = 2.\n\nConclusion: Generalised Entanglement seems to be indeed a feature of reality, if suitable rituals for a closure of a system are chosen. This lines up with attempts by Beauvais to understand results of high dilution experiments.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration conference at Yale University, 2017\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Assume that two identical particles, call them A and B, are initially at rest and that they are somehow then propelled in opposite directions. At a given instant, we can measure the position of particle A with perfect precision even according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, knowing that we thereby sacrifice any possibility of simultaneously measuring its velocity. Similarly, we can measure the velocity of particle B with perfect precision at that instant even according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, knowing that we thereby sacrifice any possibility of simultaneously measuring its position.\n\nOwing to conservation of momentum, if the precisely measured position of A is x at a given instant in time, then the precise position of B must be –x at that time. Similarly, if the precisely measured velocity of B is v, then the precise velocity of A must be –v. We have seemingly succeeded in determining the precise velocity of A and the precise position of B without having had to measure these quantities. They can be inferred with perfect precision from the value of the other particle. Einstein believed that this thought experiment demonstrated that there were indeed precise values of position and velocity for each particle created at the outset of the experiment, not by subsequent observation, that could be determined in this indirect way.\n\nIn 1964 John Bell published his now famous inequality showing that a reformulation of the EPR experiment could be experimentally tested. In 1982 Alain Aspect carried out the Bell experiment and found that quantum physics was correct and Einstein wrong. Quantum properties are not real and hidden, but instead are created in the act of measurement.\n\nIn 2003, Nobel Laureate Anthony Leggett published a more rigorous version of the Bell experiment. A Leggett inequality experiment was carried out recently in the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the University of Vienna and published in Nature in April 2007. Reporting on this New Scientist said:\n\nTheir results, published in 2007, suggest \"...that there is nothing inherently real about the properties of an object that we measure. In other words, measuring those properties is what brings them into existence.\" (New Scientist, 23 June 2007) Or as quantum researcher Vlatko Vedral of the University of Leeds puts it: \"Rather than passively observing it, we in fact create reality.\"\n\nQuantum mechanics is now telling us unambiguously that consciousness creates reality. And since quantum physics is at the root of everything, this has profound consequences for the interpretation of our own nature, the universe, and, yes, even why it may make more sense to trace everything back to a conscious intelligence rather than inanimate fields and forces.\n\nBernard Haisch, Ph.D., Calphysics Institute, is an astrophysicist and author of over 130 scientific publications.

New experimental data clearly indicate that bio-information can be transferred (via coherent light) between two biological systems.\n\nExperimental evidence is now available demonstrating the macroscopic quantum properties of biological systems including coherent excitations, quantum coherence, quantum tunneling and single-photon phenomenon. Non-local interactions between humans has been demonstrated clinically using intercessory prayer and healing at a distance. At the cellular level, new data indicates that light can carry bio-information between cellular systems. Garieaev demonstrated that a laser, passed through a salamander embryo, could carry genetic bio-information and deliver it to a frog embryo. DNA in the frog embryo could decode this information and use it to mature into a salamander. Around the same time, the author did a similar experiment, except used a chemical drug as the source of information. In these experiments, a laser was passed over powdered MAO inhibitor and projected onto nerve cells in tissue culture. Although the unmodulated laser had no effect on MAO enzyme activity when measured in the treated cells, a modulated laser did in fact alter the enzyme activity. However, the net effect was not to inhibit the enzyme, but to increase its activity. Thus the information carried by the laser did not duplicate the drug, but produced the opposite, homeopathic effect on the enzyme. More recently Sargsyan extended both of these studies using a Bioscope device which utilizes light reflected at a glass surface with a black paper backing. When a biological system is placed l5 mm away from the far side of the reflecting surface, bio-information is transferred and carried by the light. Using a photodiode to measuring the fluctuations in the intensity of the modulated light, Sargsyan obtained frequency information about the original biological system. The results suggest the presence of a quantum holographic energy/information system, which underlies/permeates all matter.\n\nThese anomalous results can be readily explained if we consider distant communication between two biological systems as a coherent interaction between two quantum systems. Accordingly, several theoretical models have been proposed based on the quantum properties of biological systems. These involve quantum entangelment, quantum superposition and the spontaneous collapse of the wave function. It is proposed here, that quantum fields are emitted and detected by each quantum system which carry and transfer quantum information between biological systems.\n\nGlen Rein has a PhD in biochemistry, was an Assistant Professor at Mt.

While Hugh Everett’s Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) does not allow for different world’s branches to interact, MIW starts from the idea that a near infinite number of parallel worlds already exist, interact very slightly, and produce what appear to be quantum wave mechanics in our world. What we perceive as quantum entanglement and particle/wave duality are the result of interference patterns produced by interacting parallel realities. MIW computer simulations show that a minimum of 41 repulsive parallel realities per electron are sufficient to create many quantum phenomena observed in our world.\n\nThus, the MIW model also implies that, what would appear as personality disorders, mental disturbances, or even some inexplicable “paranormal” phenomena, could actually be expected localized outcomes of the dynamics of such a multiverse structure. In this model macroscopic, seemingly non-local “action at distance” might be the result of local multiverse dynamics. We would also expect that a small proportion of the human population would experience such interactions. These individuals could be recognized for their creativity and problem solving abilities. In other people, this would be diagnosed as multiple personalities, now known as Disassociate Identity Disorder (DID). A specific aspect of this is the activity known as channeling along with the sometimes extreme physiological changes that accompany individuals in the channeling state such as changes in eyesight, heart rate, or brain-wave frequency. Similarly, the different personalities associated with someone diagnosed with DID often have specific allergies or diseases. However, the underlying principles would be the same for all these phenomena: coherent, resonant interactions with parallel realities.\n\nBio: Dr. Simeon Hein has a Ph.D. in sociology and is director of the non-profit Institute for Resonance (InstituteforResonance.org) located in Boulder, Colorado where he teaches resonant viewing and leads crop circle tours in the UK.

They provide strong evidence for the existence of mechanisms not included within our current mainstream-scientific worldview and theories. I hypothesize that the “mechanism” through which these strange phenomena can occur is the human subtle-energy system with its multiple, interpenetrating subtle dimensional bodies.\n\nFirst consider the scope of the evidence. Cumulative evidence for the reality of NDEs and children who remember their immediate past lives has been well documented in JSE publications and books. Recently, Edward and Emily Kelly with their coauthors produced a huge book, Irreducible Minds, in which they document the full spectrum of other unusual mind-body phenomena. To their treatment, I would add the amazing descriptions from thousands of between-lives regression cases of souls (nonphysical consciousness) in a spiritual realm that are almost in complete alignment with rich NDE accounts. I consider the cumulative accounts from both these sources provide us with a preliminary outline of this realms sociology.\n\nAs the Kellys emphasize in their book, mainstream psychology and medical sciences with their mechanistic view of life deny the reality of these phenomena. They write that an important step in the expansion of science is the development of models explaining how these unusual phenomena can be occurring. In discussion stigmata, Emily Kelly quotes two researchers about the specific processes required to create this phenomena:\n\n• Are . . . a mystery of the profoundest sort, with all sorts of implications for the so-called mind- body problem\n• [require a] “kind of superintelligence”\n\nIn my research for possible explanations, I found that the human subtle-energy system with its multiple, interpenetrating subtle-energy bodies provides the elements that can explain all of the unusual phenomena.\n\nIn this model, the etheric subtle body operates similar to a “computer program” directing the development, and maintenance of the physical body plus its response to external and internal stimuli. It is affected (programmed) by human emotions and beliefs present in the second and third bodies respectively—providing answers to the “how” of unusual psychophysical (mind-body) phenomenon such as stigmata.\n\nThis distributed, nonphysical model of consciousness (mind) is how all the near-death OBEs of our human consciousness can occur in both earth and nonearthly realms.

A major unresolved problem in physics is to provide a rigorous reason for choosing one interpretation over the others. This paper shows that any quantum theory which is to be compatible with the basic postulates of special relativity must contain relational collapse of the wavefunction. This effectively rules out about half of the available options, including, notably, the Von Neumann and Copenhagen Interpretations.\n\nQuantum theory limits what we are allowed to say about the “true” state of a quantum system if that system is unobserved. But special relativity relies fundamentally on a universal assumption about what a light particle is doing at ALL times (namely, traveling at speed c relative to any inertial observer, regardless of being observed). This fundamental conceptual gap between the theories is the starting point of the proof.\n\nIn resolving this impasse we show that the existence of light (and hence space and time) is not continuous. Since time dilation and length contraction become infinite for a photon, light can have no temporal or spatial interactions (Δt’ = 0, Δx’ = 0). To describe an interaction, the principle of simultaneity can be applied between an inertial observer and a light particle. Although light would register no separation between events, the Lorentz transform implies that the inertial observer measures a separation between those same events of exactly Δt = ΔL/c, a light-like separation. In other words, although light has no passage of time or space itself, light will always be measured by an observer at a position and time exactly as if it had travelled at speed c continuously through the medium. This fits nicely within the limitations set above by quantum mechanics, and leads to the necessary conclusion of relative states.\n\nThe author’s preferred interpretations of relational quantum mechanics and consistent histories quantum mechanics will be discussed. It will be pointed out that the relative state interpretation that is proven here is far more friendly to the possible existence of consciousness than its competing interpretations.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

A smaller number of studies have used light as the target of mental influence. Studies involving light are especially useful for studying MMI because light reveals behavior that is distinctively quantum in nature. In particular, it displays wave- like or particle-like behavior depending on how the light is observed. In physics, “observation” is generally regarded as an irreversible amplification of a microscopic event, but there are other forms of observation, including subjective awareness. This observation-dependent effect provides a unique opportunity for studying the meaning of observation and the possible role of consciousness in the physical world.\n\nThis talk briefly reviews the relevant literature on MMI experiments using optical systems. Then it focuses on a series of 15 experiments conducted in our laboratory over the past 5 years, all involving optical interferometers. The first study involved a Michelson interferometer, the next ten used a continuous beam Young-style double-slit interferometer, and the last four involved a single-photon double-slit system. The cumulative evidence from these studies suggests that mental attention acts in a manner analogous to an inefficient physical detector; that is, when the detector is operating it causes light to slightly shift from wave- to particle-like behavior. But unlike a physical detector, the mind has the capacity to turn this \"detector\" on or off through the modulation and direction of attention. I will speculate on this and other interpretations of\nthe experimental results.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

The REG outputs a stream of random one and zero bits, and the goal is to use the mind to produce a skewed distribution of bits coming out of the device (e.g. more ones than zeros). The project was a single study design with me as both subject and experimenter. The objectives were 1) to succeed in affecting the output of the device using PK to a highly significant level, and in the process 2) begin to understand how the effect might work.\n\nWhile engaged in the REG process, which took over 10 years, I logged on the order of 10,000 hours of “training time” and I wrote over 2200 pages of notes cataloging experiences and mental states. The project focused on states of mind that were correlated with moments of greater REG output success, as well as those correlated with greater negative results. The data set included the four formal studies which taken together included over 5.5 million trials. The final Z-score of the combined studies was 4.86, or odds of 1.7 million to one of being chance. As in previous REG studies, however, this significance was achieved with many trials giving a small absolute percentage deviation from the chance expectation of 50%.\n\nThe presentation will explain some of the experiences that involve very clear and distinct states of mind in relation to REG output. It puts forward a general model of consciousness, which accounts for “beginners luck” and the decline effect, as well as a theory-based analysis of why the process seems be easy at certain times and hard at others. An argument is put forward that in the future anomalies research should be focused on how the structure of the mind seeks to minimize direct outside influence rather than accentuate it. The mind creates a barrier or membrane of “meaning” to keep itself from diffusion into a collective space. The model proposed is nominally called the “associative web model of mind” and has elements of both Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory and Wheeler’s concept of meaning in the quantum measurement process.\n\nHerb Mertz\nPsyleron, Inc., \nPrinceton, NJ, USA\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Ross Dunseath","description":"One area of study at the Westphal Neuroimaging Lab is the acquisition of physiological data corresponding to psi events. Despite the fact that psi itself does not appear to be a brain process, or explainable in classical-physics terms, there is every reason to suppose that its expressions depend upon conditions in the body and especially in the brain. It is known, for example, that spontaneous psi experiences occur disproportionately in dreams and hypnagogic or twilight-zone states, and in various other altered states of consciousness (Kelly & Locke, 1981). We hypothesize that neuroimaging studies of performance in controlled psi tasks by subjects preselected for ability to succeed at those tasks or to enter the relevant states will reveal more detailed correlations of this sort.\n\nData collection for a pilot study pairing high density (32–128 channels) EEG with electronic PK sensors especially adapted for use in physiological studies was recently completed and data analysis is underway. Although one type of sensor was the main focus of the study, data was gathered from several other sensors as well, including a 3-axis magnetometer, Geiger Counter, force detector, temperature sensor, RNG, and an array of resistors. The study used a computer-controlled protocol of timed trials paced by audio commands, with audio feedback on the state of the target sensor provided at the end of each PK trial. Sixty-eight experiments with human participants were run, with a total of seven significant outcomes. Five of these had p-values less than 0.025, yielding p = 0.029 overall for the series. In contrast, no significant outcomes were ob- served in twenty-five experiments run without human participants. Preliminary results in EEG show differences between PK and rest conditions in EEG power spectra, but most of the analysis remains to be done at the time of this writing. \n\nW.J. Ross Dunseath, Ph.D., is Co-director with Edward Kelly of the Westphal Neuroimaging Laboratory, under the auspices of Cedar Creek Institute and the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia. He has long collaborated with Edward Kelly in both psi and neurophysiology research, including the use of high- resolution EEG and fMRI techniques to investigate adaptation of human somatosensory cortex to natural tactile stimuli. A by-product of that collaboration was his development of the world’s first truly fMRI-compatible EEG system.\n\nRecorded at the 34th annual SSE Conference  in 2015 at the Hilton Washington DC/Rockville hotel.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

This reversal of the influence could not be explained with the existing theories of psi influence, and for several reasons this avenue of investigation was terminated. Given that this effect might represent a clue to the underlying structure of mind over matter influence, the current study set about replicating and extending the MegaREG experiments by examining the influence of human intention over a range of 10 different frequencies from 200 bits per second to 16 million bits per second, on a new, purpose-built REG machine. The study used commercially available REG’s, covered 127 series of 1000 trials, and was undertaken by 5 operators over a period of 18 months, following protocols largely similar to those of the PEAR study. The results overall indicated no consistent variation of influence with frequency, though individual performances appeared to show idiosyncratic frequency effects at levels just over statistical significance.\n\nIn line with the conference theme of expanding the boundaries of science, the discussion extends beyond the findings of this particular study to examine theoretical models potentially most suited to describing the type of influence exhibited in this experiment, and to suggest methods of validating these models.\n\nBio: After starting out as a school teacher Keith Alexander did an engineering degree and PhD at University of Canterbury.

Many important philosophical, technical and theoretical questions are raised by the present study. Of central importance to all three of the parameters listed above, the present study will address the very important question of whether it is the source of the randomness which matters most or the belief and expectations of the operator regarding said source. Three experimental conditions are utilized to best answer these questions. The first condition, which serves to address the role of belief in successful operation, consists of a single-operator database in which data are generated from a pseudorandom source but the operator is under the false belief that the data is from a truly random, microelectronic noise source. The final two conditions are meant to provide a more general understanding of how the effect is manifested and differ only by the run lengths used. One condition utilizes the 100- trial run length while the other utilizes the 1000-trial run length. A comparison of these two conditions could help us understand if the effect manifests itself only at the initialization of each run or if the situation is more complex.

The current methodology largely accounts for only one of the two fundamental classes of natural phenomena. It currently addresses equilibrium states of nature and trends toward these equilibrium states. This approach allows for the development of reliable mechanisms and technologies stemming from physical phenomena. But it largely fails to address is the individual actions of complex systems that move away from equilibrium, such as Prigogine’s dissipative structures (like hurricanes and Benard cells) and much biological activity including the time-evolution of brain states and mind states.\n\nThese two classes of phenomena—movements toward equilibrium and movements away from it—can be given the respective names, models and moments. Models describe of average values in nature that represent reproducible and reliable phenomena. It is what we mean when we say that science creates models. Moments on the other hand are individual events that must be looked at individually in both time and space. Moments never occur or reproduce in exactly the same way, and their trend values are uncertain and outcomes probabilistic. The reticence of science to embrace the class of phenomena is because their behaviors are inherently unpredictable (by definition), and thus not amenable to normal modeling. Human minds, however, can be shown to exhibit both model and moment behavior, and unless we examine both we cannot fully understand human activity. Further, and most important here, this framework allows us to begin understanding the nature and character of anomalous events produced by the human mind.\n\nIn this presentation, I show how the structure of mind can be set in the above framework so as to explain results seen in random event generator (REG) studies. In my own long-term use of the REG, I have been able to watch my own mind as it engages in real-time experience, and develop a model of the structure of these activities. That is, rather than model the nature of moment events directly—which cannot be done as their outcomes are inherently uncertain—this process models the structure that underlies their activity.\n\nBio: Herb Mertz is a graduate of Princeton University with a degree in mechanical engineering.

The newly coalescing Internet created the means to build a globe-spanning network of REGs, while instantaneous news ensured synchronous reactions to major events. We could ask whether mass consciousness might be reflected in correlated REG behavior. Would shared emotional responses to a devastating earthquake produce effects? Or the world shaking 9/11 terrorist at- tacks? What about the passions of a billion World Cup fans? Could the shared joy of great celebrations evoke changes in the random behavior of our instruments? All these questions and more became the subject of the Global Consciousness Project, which is now nearly old enough to vote at 17 years and counting.\n\nWe have accumulated a seven-sigma deviation in answer to our basic question: Is there structure in random data during periods of shared attention to global events? The odds against chance are trillions to one, but beyond that, secondary analysis shows further structure. The findings suggest deep unconscious connections among humans that may be the source of correlations we find in otherwise random data. There are competing explanations for our anomalous results, but it is notable that an interconnected humanity is consonant with both ancient and modern ideas of unity and oneness.\n\nThese subtle indications of mind-to-mind connections bear a profound and timely message. Without effort we come together and we become one during a great tragedy or celebration, and in so doing we change the physical world. What might we accomplish if we deliberately interconnect and work to become an effective global consciousness?\n\nRoger Nelson is the founder and director of the Global Consciousness Project, an international collaboration of scientists, artists, and others interested in the extraordinary aspects of human consciousness.

Quantitative Analysis of an Instance of Spoon Bending | Willem H. van den Berg","description":"Was It an Illusion? Quantitative Analysis of an Instance of Spoon Bending [SSE]\nWillem H. van den Berg\nHoward, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nThere are many entertainers who use sleight of hand or specially prepared trick cutlery to give the appearance of psychokinetic metal bending. However, there are some who seem to have a genuine psychic ability in this regard, and furthermore there are reports of many inexperienced people acquiring this ability when appropriately coached.\n\nIn an effort to determine with certainty whether metal bending by intention alone is possible, one instance of spoon bending was analyzed quantitatively. A stainless steel spoon purchased from a restaurant supply company was marked to guard against substitution and given to a professional “mentalist” for bending. A close range video recording- was made of the spoon during the entire time it was handled by the mentalist.\n\nAt first the spoon was bent in half about an axis perpendicular to the long axis of the spoon. This was accompanied by several flourishes of the mentalist’s hands, during which one might argue that extremely deft sleight of hand had caused the bending.\n\nNext the mentalist used obvious muscular force to re-straighten the spoon. Then he wrapped the fingers of one hand around the handle of the spoon and held the other hand about 3—5 cm away from the protruding bowl of the spoon. When the bowl had rotated 180 degrees about the long axis of the spoon (without the handle rotating), he relinquished the spoon thus permanently deformed.\n\nAlthough it appeared that this twisting occurred without the application of any mechanical torque, it must be asked whether the mentalist had surreptitiously caused the 180 degree rotation while straightening the spoon. Furthermore, it is possible that the prior bending and re-straightening of the spoon might have weakened the metal. To investigate these possibilities, the following experiment was conducted on an identical spoon to which a bolt was welded so that a torque wrench could be applied. After bending in half and then re-straightening the spoon, it was found that a torque of over 20 inch-pounds (2.26 newton-meters) was required to rotate the bowl of the spoon as described above. However, the maximum torque that could be exerted by this author (an adult man) using both hands was less than4 inch-pounds (0.45 newton-meters). When this bare-hands torque was applied, the spoon bent a few degrees but then snapped back to its original conformation. In fact, nearly 20 inch-pounds could be exerted without permanently deforming the metal.\n\nThese results strongly suggest that human intention is sometimes capable of permanently deforming steel without application of mechanical force or heat.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

These effects may result from conscious intention or subconscious desire (the latter of which may oppose the former). This presentation aims to explore the methods and outcomes from three different experiments varying in experimenter belief, desire, and intention. \n\nIn the first experiment, the output from a random event generator (REG) is collected during forty 30-second trials. Each trial has an overall result of either ‘high’ (more ones than zeros) or ‘low’ (more zeros than ones). Software was developed to generate a hidden file containing a list of success criteria (i.e., high or low) for each of the 40 trials. With no outside influence, 50% of the listed criteria should match the outcomes for the respective trials. What happens, though, when the experimenter---who strongly believes in the effect of his consciousness on the outcome---sets the generalized intention that “the experiment is successful”? \n\nThe second experiment uses no electronic equipment and examines macro-psychokinesis in the form of changes in air pressure by employing an air-tight chamber (roughly 1 cubic ft.), the opening of which is tightly fitted with a latex membrane. A small optical mirror is affixed to the membrane so that changes in air pressure within the chamber affect the orientation of the mirror. A tripod mounted laser is aimed at the mirror so that the beam reflects to a target roughly 10 feet away and any movement of the membrane due to changes in air pressure can be determined by the shift in the beam visible on the target. In this case, the experimenter does not believe that his consciousness can alter air pressure, but he has confidence that deceased people or other non-physical consciousnesses might be able to cause changes.\n\nWill there be a difference between the distance the beam moves during control sessions and sessions in which the experimenter invites the pressure to change? In the third experiment, a target area is designated in a darkened room and bisected with a laser light source. Deceased individuals are invited to attempt to “push” more ambient dust into the visible beam during active periods of data collection. The numbers and position of highlighted airborne particulates are tracked and quantified: digital images of the target area are captured using extended exposures from a remotely triggered, tripod-mounted digital camera and the resulting images from active and control sessions are analyzed using particle analysis software. Will more dust enter the beam during active periods? The data collected to date, conclusions drawn, potential implications, limitations, and value of these research protocols will be discussed.\n\nMark Boccuzzi, researcher and Director of Operations at the Windbridge Institute for Applied Research in Human Potential, is currently an associate member of the Parapsychological Association.

(2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) reported that non-contact healers exhibited good healing effects using pieces of plants as biosensors. Notably their effects were measured by gas or fluorescence emissions from pieces of cucumber, showing a distribution of bio-psychokinetic (PK) effects, not only for the nearest target in front of the participant, but also other targets set within around a few meters around the participant. These results showed high reproducibility. If these kinds of healing energy are distributed around healers without their awareness, we can consider that biosensors and Random Number Generators can be used as detectors of these anomalistic phenomena; as sensors of field consciousness.\n\nA Random Number Generator (RNG) is an instrument that produces bit sequences (0 or 1) at high speed through physical means. Many previous studies for PK or field consciousness have reported that these RNG outputs become statistically biased under certain circumstances. In case of typical PK experiments, one of the most important factors is the intent of the participant, whereas field RNG studies have demonstrated statistical biases in the absence of anyone who might intend to influence the output of the RNG or in the presence of subjects who are unaware or have no knowledge about the presence of the RNG. In any case, these kinds of anomalies can be interpreted as the consequence of micro PK.\n\nThe purpose of the current study was to examine possibility that RNG outputs would be affected by experimental PK tasks. To this end, we employed two PK tasks. The first was the bio-PK task designed by Kokubo et al., in which participants would try to heal cucumber pieces. The other involved a varying weight task using metal nails. While the participants’ attention would be focused on the targets (sensor) alone, we hypothesized that the output of the RNG, which were not known to be located near the participant, would be influenced by a certain state of consciousness if the energy affected space entropy without specific intent.\n\nResults found no biases in the RNG outputs during the PK tasks. Unfortunately, the findings did not support our hypothesis. Although the current analysis focused on the value of the end event, it may be easier to observe bias if we focus on all the processes of the SS transition for each period. The results were different between healers. An RNG outputs showed an increase of variance over all periods in the nail-weight increasing task, whereas another results of the weight decrease task showed small variances over all intervals. Since this was a pilot study, the sample size was not sufficient. When we consider that the wavelet was not able to detect any difference, the current results suggest that anomalies of RNG are not merely physical signals, but need to be explained by other frameworks.\n\nRecorded at the 33rd annual SSE Conference  in 2014 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport,\nBurlingame, California, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

When successfully “treated,” picked bananas appear to bypass normal autolytic stages, accelerated weight loss relative to controls, and finally hardening to a permanent state of mummification.\n\nWe have done more than four dozen replications, testing conditions well beyond those attempted by Grad. We suggest that a single event leads to a cascade effect, altering the production or reception of ethylene (a plant hormone key to banana ripening) and amylase (responsible for conversion of starch to sugar during ripening), as well as modifying conversion of protopectin to soluble pectin.\n\nAmong our findings: mummification is contact dependent (different from “normal” hands-on healing data); takes place without regard to the intent or mental focus of the healer; is blocked with plastic and copper foil; cannot be done through healing surrogates (e.g. cotton); is dose dependent. Resonant bonding with controls may be occurring, though it is not consistent.\nWith further work, the physiology of this form of banana mummification can be clarified.

As he entered an enclosed MRI for measurement, different sealed envelopes were placed in Bengston’s left hand, some empty and others containing pictures and hair samples of animals with cancer. Despite no conscious knowledge of the contents within each envelope on Bengston’s part, the fMRI scans revealed two distinct patterns: the presence of a healing state when Bengston held the animal sample envelopes and the absence of a healing state when he held empty ones.\n\nA similar experiment was conducted to identify an unconscious provocation of a healing response. However, Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) energy assessments replaced MRI scans to measure the presence of a healing response. GDV scans have been previously used to measure Bengston Method of Energy Healing responses in more than 40 therapists and patients at Equilibrium Energy + Education in Chicago.\n\nNine individuals trained in the Bengston Method of Energy Healing participated in the experiment. Eight were trained by Bengston during a two-day in-person workshop while one was self-trained using Bengston’s CD program. All were instructed not to consciously “cycle” (the subjective means of initiating a healing energy flow) and were deliberately distracted during the experiment to direct their conscious attention elsewhere. Each was given a sealed envelope holding either a blank index card or a card with the names of three cancer patients currently undergoing Bengston Method treatments. The experimenters and all participants were blind to the contents within each envelope. Only one individual held an envelope at a time to minimize interaction effects. After holding the envelopes for ten minutes, the energetic state of each individual was captured using the GDV technology.\n\nThe energy fields of the individuals holding the cancer patient envelopes indicated a strong healing response, as expected. However, the energy fields of the individuals holding blank index card envelopes also indicated a response, at only a slightly lesser extent. While these results corroborate Bengston’s earlier findings, the experiment raises a new set of questions about a “group response” in healing and the nature of resonant bonding.\n\nBio: Vernon Nicolas is the Research Director and Bernadette Doran is the Director of Equilibrium Energy + Education, a Chicago wellness center dedicated exclusively to research- based energy therapies, classes and training workshops.\n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

In tests conducted within a Faraday cage, sensors included 38 transducers: eleven 3-axis magnetometers, a geomagnetometer, two electromag- netic sensors, and two Caduceus antennas. Samples were recorded with 24-bit resolution at a sampling rate of 44.1 KHz. Sessions included scenarios where healers treated subjects, charged cotton or crystals, or sat quietly with\nno conscious healing intent. Other recordings involved only charged or uncharged cotton, other artifacts, or no object at all. Early analysis found some deviations between healing and control periods, but these deviations were not observed to appear in a systematic way.\n\nFurther analysis of twenty recordings has been carried out more recently using greater spectral resolution, particularly at low frequencies, and studying short term temporal events. This work has revealed additional interesting features in the signals. In several cases, relatively large differences were noticed between very low frequency spectral content in some healing scenarios versus controls. Short term temporal bursts of relatively large amplitude with trailing oscillations were found to occur more often during sessions that include periods of healing (though not always when a healer is consciously trying to heal) as opposed to recordings where no healer is present.\nIt was observed that many signal events which occurred during sessions that include healing periods were recorded by sensors near the subject being treated, rather than near the healer. Recognized signal events were tabulated to summarize the number of events of different types observed at different locations. This summary may be suggestive of some trends.

Moga","description":"Exceptional Experiences of Healers: A Survey of Healing Touch Practitioners and Students \nMargaret M. Moga \n\nExceptional and non-ordinary experiences, also termed anomalous experiences, have long been associated with healing, occurring in both healers and healees . Exceptional experiences of healers include unusual sensate phenom-ena, such as images, bodily feelings and sounds, as well as contact with nonphysical beings and other dimensions. \n\nIn this pilot study, a cross-sectional design was used to determine the types and prevalence of sensory and extrasensory experiences among Healing Touch practitioners and students. Healing Touch (HT) is an energy healing, biofield therapy developed by holistic nurses. Data was obtained with an online survey using a new instrument, the Healer Experience Scale (HES). The HES contains both semi-quantitative, Likert scale (e.g., “have you seen...chakras/meridians” “never, a few times, sometimes, often”) and qualitative (e.g., describe “unusual visual experiences”) questions. The HES was administered to a convenience sample (n=183) of HT practitioners (n=110) and students (n=73). Pearson’s product-moment correlation and student’s t-test were used to test any significant associations/differences between item average scores and demographic characteristics. \n\nThe major finding was that HT practitioners and students feel unusual tactile sensations more often than other sensations, such as visual or auditory, during healing sessions. Respondents “often” feel areas of heaviness or congestion, prickly sensations, and/or warmth or heat while touching the client or moving their hands through the client’s biofield. Other tactile sensations included “electrical current” and static charge, “bubbles” and effervesce like a can of soda pop, “cool air leaks”, pressing/pulling sensations, stickiness, and vibrations. \n\nThe most common visual experience was of “light filling” the client’s body or “light dissolving” something within the client’s biofield. Other common visual experiences included seeing, “images related to the client’s life” and “different colors”. \n\nThe most common auditory experience was a telepathic conversation with a “guide” or deceased relatives of the client. A great variety of unusual sounds were reported by the healers, including, “crackling energy sounds”, humming and buzzing, music, singing, birds, bells/chimes, mumbling/whispers, and “tonal frequencies”. \nUnusual smells and tastes during Healing Touch were reported as rare or infrequent. Unpleasant odors, such as “the smell of something rotten” or “stale”, were noted when healers were clearing “very dense energies” from the client’s biofield. Pleasant odors such as flower smells and perfumes were also reported. Healers “often” observe visible changes in their client indicating an energetic release, including facial changes, a change in the client’s breathing pattern, and movement of the client’s body (e.g., twitching/jerking). \n\nAs preliminary validation of the HES, the responses of the two groups (students and practitioners) were similar (Pearson’s coefficient = 0.9118), but the frequency of reported experiences was significantly lower among students as compared to practitioners. The prevalence of tactile experiences suggests that practitioners may possibly be responding to subtle physical stimuli caused by fields associated with the client’s body. The HES may be useful in assessing the training and effectiveness of healers, but more importantly, studies of exceptional experiences of healers may lead to new insights into the putative energies and mechanisms involved in biofield therapies and other anomalous phenomena.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference in Boulder, Colorado 2016. \n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

A broad sample of practitioners from many traditions were voluntarily recruited for this study, including Reiki, Pranic, Johrei, Faith Healing, Shamanic, Vedic, Quantum Touch, and Deeksha. A partial report has been previously communicated (J. Acosta- Urquidi, AAPB, 2009; ISSSEEM, 2010).\n\nEEG data was recorded using Lexicor NRS-24 and Mitsar 201 amplifiers (St. Petersburg, Russia), employing 19-channel electrocap, referential linked ears, impedances ca. 5 KOhms, 250 samples/sec. Data from N = 20 healers (8 male, 12 female, age 40–65) were analyzed using Neuroguide software (www.appliedneuroscience.com). Peak Absolute FFT spectral power values (uV2) were compared before (baseline resting eyes closed, EC) and during eyes closed healing state (HS). Data were statistically analyzed (paired correlated samples t-test). Healers were recorded under two conditions: with client present in the room (some healers preferred light touching of client), and distant healing (working with a distant client).\n\nDuring the healing state (HS), healers shifted brain states across all frequency bands: Delta (0.3–4 Hz), Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–12 Hz) and Beta (13–40 Hz). However, the most consistent and reproducible result, found in 90% of the healers sample studied, was a statistically significant robust increase in global Alpha spectral power (mean % increase 109.5 ± 16.34). Clients receiving a healing also exhibited highly significant increased Alpha power (mean % increase 105.17 ± 26.17). In recent tests with a gifted healer, we demonstrated robust EEG effects, recorded from two clients, who received a distant healing (Seattle, WA, to Santa Cruz, CA). This is a demonstration of non-locality in the domain of energy healing. The unexpected finding that different healing traditions all share a common increase in Alpha power during HS is discussed.\n\nIt is emphasized that these studies measured shifts in EEG brain states; no claims as to the efficacy of the healing were investigated. Different topographic brainmaps showing that Alpha relative (and absolute) power is selectively increased in a Deeksha healer during on-site healing will be shown demonstrating the effect. \n\nRecorded at the 31st annual SSE Conference in 2012 at the Millennium Hotel in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Bengston\nSt. Joseph's College\n\nData from experiments which tested 1) the effect of healing with intent on cancerous laboratory mice, and 2) fMRI brain correlates to healing, are selectively summarized to address the question of whether there is a connection between conscious states of mind and healing efficacy. The alternative and complementary medical community has enthusiastically embraced spirituality and selected altered states of consciousness as positive corollaries to healing. A transcendent experience of wonder is often taken as a sign that a larger force can work through both the healer and healee to produce medically verifiable improvements that would not otherwise occur. Similarly, it is widely assumed that both the healer and healee’s state of mind can have direct and powerful implications for healing efficacy.\n\nIn these experiments, however, volunteer healers with no previous experience or belief in healing with intent were successful in producing full lifespan cures in mouse cancer models that are normally fatal. Further, fMRI brain data indicate a non-conscious response in the brain of the healer to the need for healing. Successful healing has been produced by volunteers who have experienced a wide range of subjective sense of connection (and lack of connection) to their experimental mice, and fMRI data indicate a strong and reliable difference in healer brain output in which the healer and experimenter were blinded as to the health needs of experimental animal subjects.\n\nWhile it may initially seem reasonable to conclude that the subjective sense of connection may not be necessary to affect healing, methodological complications resulting from an apparent resonant bonding between experimental and control groups render interpretation problematical. These resonant bonds are interpreted as fluid, with the potential of being either strengthened or weakened by both consciousness and shared experience.\n\nBill Bengston is a professor of sociology at St. Joseph's College in New York, and President of the SSE.

Results indicate that: once cured, mice apparently are not affected by further re-injections of the cancer; transplantation of cells from remitting tumors will cure fully infected mice without further healing intervention; a “treated” cancer line no longer will seed forward; there are apparent anomalous geomagnetic and REG readings which occur in the lab rooms only while the mice have cancer. Further results indicate that these effects seem to be independent of distance. And, mice in an experiment apparently can become “entangled” or “resonantly bonded,” so that a treatment to one cage apparently affects all cages in the experiment.\n\nOn one hand there appear to be both biological and physical data that might be used to reproduce the healing without the healer.

[SSE]\nRoger D. Nelson\nGlobal Consciousness Project, Princeton NJ, USA, Email: rdnelson@princeton.edu\n\nCumulative results of an experiment spanning 17 years and 500 events supports the proposal of global consciousness (GC), which can be envisioned as a field-like effect. But there is an alternate interpretation recently advocated by Peter Bancel (2014, 2016), namely that the GCP result is due to a goal-oriented (GO) effect similar to the DAT model of May, et al. (1995), which says precognized feedback from future experimental results can influence choices made in the experiment. Earlier, Bancel (2011) compared these models and concluded: “the GCP data reject the DAT model with moderately high confidence. [And] one can show that a similar procedure which tests the alternate hypothesis of a physical effect accepts that hypothesis as being consistent with the data.”\n\nBancel’s new perspective assumes the XOR that conditions RNG data would also remove any effect of consciousness because that would require physically changing a bit from 0 to 1 or vice versa. This would demand virtually impos- sible microsecond synchronization of effects and XOR timing. In contrast DAT or GO requires no physical effect, only psi- enhanced decisions for event and analysis parameters that will produce future results aligned with experimenter goals.\nWe expand the picture to include secondary analyses addressing questions that had not been asked in the experi- mental design, and were not considered in event selection. These show data structure which is incompatible with GO.\n\n1. In addition to the primary correlation of RNG means across the network, there is a substantial second order cor- relation of the variances.\n2. On average, it takes about half an hour for the cumulative deviation to peak, followed by an hour or two of steady state and then a decline.\n3. Correlation strength decreases as the separation between RNG pairs increases, but only during small, relatively local events.\n4. The effect size is a function of time-of-day. It is largest in the local afternoon, and smallest in the middle of the night. It depends on whether we are awake or asleep.\n5. Post facto analysis shows the trial data are autocorrelated. This was not a “goal” of the experiment, but it is a natural expectation for a field-like model.\n6. There is evidence for true negative outcomes in an estimated 17% of GCP events. This is not compatible with the GO model, being actively contrary to the experimenters’ hypothesis and expectations. (Bancel and Nelson, 2008)\nSuch indicators of structure fit the GC model naturally, but they require a tremendous stretch for GO. Postulating that everything one finds in the data is only there because of experimenter intention is tantamount to giving up on experimental design, and giving in to unfalsifiability. The data demand more generous models, which accommodate multiple sources of effects.\n\nRecorded at the Society for Scientific Exploration Conference (2016)\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Classical mechanical and electrical systems appear to be enhanced by taking into account a higher order differential term... even to the extent of this extension of the physics impacting the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nBy adding a single linear term to the traditional equations, we are able to account for extreme and/or sudden changes in the rate of acceleration in either a particle or an electric charge (or a larger collection of the same), as well as taking advantage of a time constant related to the apparent size of the system in question. The larger the time constant and/or the greater the rate of change of acceleration -- i.e. the more the radical the change of pace -- the greater the effect. The addition of this single linear term was first introduced by William O. Davis and elaborated upon by G. Harry Stine, and effectively transformed the mathematical descriptions from second order differential equations into third order differential equations. Arthur Young has, seperately, referred to this third order differential term as \"control\", thereby implying a possible link to consciousness. The presentation will describe additional mathematics and physical results.\n\nThe mathmatical equations and solutions can be shown, for example, to be relevant to various specialized areas of physical research, including: Sonoluminesence, Special Relativity, and Mach's Principle... as well as being applicable to advanced propulsion systems, resonance systems, connective physics, and a host of other physical, albeit some relatively mundane, phenomena. The latter includes aspects of: Karate, tornadoes, hammering, homeopathy, chiropractic, and head banging.

The least ambitious version deals with the problem that serious deep space travel is all but made impossible by the requirement that one take along ridiculous amounts of propellant to get anywhere interesting in a reasonable amount of time. This version of the problem can be stated as: Is there a way to accelerate an object without expelling material propellant? The more ambitious version of the problem addresses the issue of whether it is possible to make practicable wormholes. These have been known since the work of Morris and Thorne in 1988 to require a Jupiter mass of negative restmass material confined in the throat of the wormhole. Mach's principle leads to the prediction of transient effects that can be used to address both versions of the propulsion problem.\n\nThese effects and their implications are briefly reviewed. An experiment designed to test for the presence of Mach effects that may be applicable to the less ambitious version of the propulsion problem is then described. The effect in question is a mass fluctuation that results when an object is accelerated while its internal energy is changing. It consists of accelerating a capacitor with a piezoelectric actuator as the capacitor is driven with an alternating voltage to produce the changing internal energy needed.\n\nRecorded at the 30th annual SSE Conference in 2011 at the Millennium Harvest House in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Its existence and general properties are universally acknowledged by energy healers, who say that assessing and manipulating the components of the aura are an integral part of many healing practices. As evidence has mounted in recent years that energy healing works, and is even effective over thousands of miles, yet questions remain: What is the nature of the aura? What is it made of? What role does it play in long range healing?\n\nDr. Swanson has recently completed a comprehensive study of subtle energy and the role it plays in energy medicine. This is summarized in his new book, Life Force, The Scientific Basis, a comprehensive study of subtle energy. In it, he develops a model based on physics which explains the nature of the aura. It is based on a form of energy called \"torsion,\" which interacts with particle spins, and was discovered in Russia in the 1950's. Torsion has undergone extensive verification and is believed by Russian scientists to be the same thing as subtle energy.\n\nTorsion is produced whenever a particle undergoes a spin flip. When absorbed it causes a spin change in the absorbing particle. As a result, it is produced whenever electromagnetic energy is produced. Consequently, the biophoton field inside the body is accompanied by a torsion field which has similar frequency and structure. One difference is that the biophoton field is kept primarily inside the body, while the torsion field extends beyond the body. F.-A. Popp has shown that the biophoton field has phase coherence and other properties needed to create a hologram inside the body. It serves as a template to guide growth and repair processes within the body. Outside the body the torsion field has a similar holographic structure, which creates the layers and chakras described by healers.\n\nAccording to Russian research, the torsion field has components which travel faster than light as well as a component which travels backwards in time. This has been verified experimentally in astronomical measurements using torsion detectors. These factors, together with its coupling to the biophoton field, make torsion the ideal candidate as the carrier of long distance healing and consciousness information. It explains how healers are able to affect their clients over thousands of miles, as well as how QiGong masters are able to affect physical phenomena at long range. It may also be the underlying \"force\" which mediates other psychic phenomena, such as ESP, PK and remote viewing.\n\nA method of focusing called \"four dimensional holography\" is proposed to explain how consciousness phenomena operate over great distances without weakening, and how the effects can be received either earlier or later than the transmission. It explains how QiGong healers can project their influence with pinpoint accuracy and how this force can affect a wide variety of physical phenomena. This model also has application to other effects related to non-local consciousness.\nFigure 1. Holographic fields of biophotons, inside body, and torsion field forming aura, outside body. \n\nDr. Swanson was educated as a physicist at MIT ('69) and received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University (1976). He has worked as a consultant in applied physics for more than two decades, as well as pursuing research into the physics of anomalous phenomena. His primary interest is in identifying areas of anomaly and developing an expanded physics model which can account for such phenomena. He has written a book, \"The Synchronized Universe-New Science of the Paranormal,\" summarizing some of his findings.\n\nRecorded at the 29th annual SSE Conference in 2010 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Since the Sun-Earth distance varies with an annual period, it is reasonable to suspect that some kind of radiation from the Sun may be playing a role. We have found that the low-energy solar-neutrino flux exhibits a periodicity of about 12 year-1, suggesting that the solar core rotates at this (synodic) frequency, which is slower than the rotation rates of either the convection zone of the radiative zone.\n\nIf neutrinos play a role in influencing nuclear decay rates, the same periodicity may be manifested in decay measurements. We have therefore carried out power-spectrum analyses of measurements made at BNL over a 7-year interval of the decay rates of 32Si and 36Cl, and of measurements made at PTB over a 15-year interval of the decay rate of 226Ra. These analyses yield evidence for periodicities compatible with the estimated rotation rate of the solar core.\n\nThese results pose challenging questions for nuclear physics and for solar physics. Do neutrinos affect decay rates? If so, what does that tell us about neutrinos? Furthermore, if beta-decay rates vary in time, this may influence the planning of medical radiation treatments. It may also affect estimates, based on carbon dating, of the dates of early events and ancient artifacts.\n\nThe work of PAS was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through grant AST-0097128. .\n\nP.A.

Unfortunately Newton's Third Law enforces the rocket paradox for any self-contained system of propulsion. For a self-contained vehicle to be capable of large velocity changes without astronomical energy expenditures, it would seem necessary to find a drive system which is somehow not constrained by the law of action and reaction. Unfortunately, any such system would inherently violate both conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. While no violation of these laws has ever been observed, and classical theory indicates that they are direct mathematical consequences (via Noether's Theorem) of fundamental symmetries, energy and momentum conservation have not actually been shown to hold for General Relativity itself. Competing non-relativistic theories, on the other hand, while they may be amenable to the Noether construction, may admit of nonlocal interactions which could produce apparent local nonconservation. While the above reasoning shows that non-Newtonian propulsion may be possible, none of the hypothetical phenomena that might enable such processes have actually been confirmed by experiment. Even those candidates that are most plausible on theoretical grounds are far beyond our current technical reach. Bearing these caveats in mind, there are several such prospects that seem worth further scrutiny. These include manipulation of inertial mass; manipulation of gravitational mass; interaction with tachyonic states; nonlocal (nonrelativistic) interactions; and electromagnetic storage of momentum.

I will not go into that evidence here. Rather, my current purposal is a philosophical and strategic one, in which I will argue that the Paradigm Argument is not merely flawed, but in fact gains no purchase whatsoever against evidence-based arguments in favor of ESP and other psi phenomena.\n\nA fairly common formulation of the PAAP goes something like this: In order for a phenomenon to be accepted as real, it must be explainable as a part of an accepted explanatory framework.\n\nThe existence of a truly unexplainable phenomenon suggests that the paradigm within which explanations are made must be expanded or replaced. But without a clear account of the causal basis for said phenomenon - and hence an explanation that provides a sufficient alternative to the current explanatory framework - it is not reasonable to significantly alter or abandon the current paradigmatic scaffolding merely to allow us to accept an otherwise explanatorily recalcitrant phenomenon.\n\nIt is more reasonable instead to reject the recalcitrant phenomena than it is to reject or seriously revise a paradigm that seems to work for most other phenomena and features of the universe.\n\nPsi phenomena are unexplained by the current paradigmatic explanatory framework of science. Therefore, we should reject psi phenomena and leave the paradigm as it is. Physicalism, the doctrine that everything in the universe is physical or the consequence of physical facts, is taken to represent the dominant paradigmatic context. To the degree that psi or ESP phenomena violate physicalist theory they must, by this argument, be rejected.\n\nI argue that this entire anti-psi argument is ill-formed and mistaken. This is because what the argument takes to be an acceptable paradigmatic context - physicalism - is in fact rife with unsupportable metaphysical assumptions and is therefore itself unsuited as a sufficient explanator of what there is. Moreover, it provides inadequate grounds to reject psi and ESP phenomena as not real or relevant to science. I will argue in detail for my thesis, starting relevant arguments from both pro- and anti-psi theorists, but going beyond to pose a new argument that shows the inherent weakness in the physicalist position. \n\nMajor Paul H.

ARV was developed in 1984 by Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, making use of trained viewers to predict future events. Since that time, there has been limited experimentation resulting in few publications, despite indications that suggest that the ARV protocol works and can be easily repeated. The current experiment used ARV with untrained viewers. The participants were drawn from a University of Colorado class and had no formal training in ESP or remote viewing prior to the start of this project.\n\nFor each trial the tasker chose two images, one that he linked to a DJIA rise and the other to a fall. He did not reveal either image to anyone until the end of the market day, which was a day or two after the ARV session. For the first five minutes of seven successive class sessions, the students were tasked to describe an image that was to be shown to them after the close of the market on the designated day. The tasker and other judges compared the viewers' drawings to the two images and judged which image each drawing was closer to. The image that the majority of viewers' sessions was judged to most closely resemble was used to predict the outcome of the market and guide the investment. The results are shown in the table, where D and U indicates down or up predictions, respectively, and M indicates mixed predictions which could not be linked clearly to either image. The number following the letter indicates the judged quality of correspondence of the drawing to the image.\n\nUsing this ARV protocol, the participants successfully predicted the outcome of the DJIA in seven out of the seven trials (binomial probability test, p less than .01). Investments in stocks were made based on the outcomes of the amateur remote viewers' sessions resulting in a significant financial gain over a short period of time.

Thermal energy transfer according to the Kinetic Theory of Heat and Statistical Mechanics that takes place over distances greater than the mean free path of the gas circumvents the microscopic randomness that leads to macroscopic irreversibility. No information is required to \"sort\" the particles, as no sorting occurs.\n\nThe Proell effect achieves quasi-spontaneous thermal separation without sorting by the perturbation of a heterogeneous constant volume system with displacement and regeneration. The classical analysis of the constant volume process, such as found in the Stirling Cycle, is incomplete and therefore incorrect. There are extra energy flows that classical thermo does not recognize. When a working fluid is displaced across a temperature gradient through a regenerative heat exchanger, complimentary pressure-volume compression and expansion work takes place that transfers energy between the regenerator and the bulk gas volumes on the hot and cold sides of the constant volume system that is not recognized by classical thermo, but which completely conforms to classical thermo. Heat capacity at constant pressure applies instead of heat capacity at constant volume. The increased energy flow represented by the heat capacity ratio, gamma, represents such a large increase in the heat that can be recycled in a regenerator that it can exceed the Carnot limit in certain cycles.

The outcome of an observation depends on the perspective with which the observation is made; in other words, the observed statistical moments depend on the time, location, interval, orientation, sampling methodology, etc...\n\nThe lack of well-developed techniques for modeling changing statistical moments in our observations has stymied the application of stochastic process theory for many scientific and engineering applications. These limitations were encountered when modeling temporal effects of calibration frequency on the performance of a radiometer with non stationary receiver fluctuations. In radiometer systems, frequent calibration using noise references is used for reducing the effect of fluctuations in the instrument. Calibration, as it turns out, is key to studying and characterizing non stationary processes. The development of a generalized approach for comparative analysis to modeling radiometer calibration system architectures has led to Ensemble Detection and Analysis (EDA) as a new method for studying and characterizing non stationary processes. Ensemble samples of a process are collected by mixing a signal with calibrated noise.\n\nIn stochastic process theory, the ensemble expectation operator is evaluated from an ensemble set of series existing over an interval. Alternatively, a process is treated as a single series of events with each event modeled as a random variable with a conditional probability density function; the process is then described by a Probability State Function (PSF). The mathematical symmetry between the PSF and EDA permits comparison of uncertainty of model and data. Unprecedented agreement is achieved between measurements and model calculations. The mathematical framework gives structure to an Observation Theory that links our expectations to observed outcome. This presentation will describe and explore the applications and implications of the theory. \n\nPaul Racette, DSc.

In this presentation I explore a phenomenon associated with kundalini yoga. Other cultures have described similar effects using different terms and facilitating concepts. My material is based on key aspects from the kundalini literature including the writings of kundalini practitioners and those who have examined the reported effects. I describe observations from colleagues and from my own personal experiences. These experiences show how a link with kundalini phenomenon led to my interest in precognition. I provide a few illustrations where the kundalini effect enhanced the precognitive results, including a long distance communication experiment with a deep diving submersible and specific future events such as the Columbia space shuttle disaster.\n\nKundalini experiences can include a variety of unusual sensations that are disturbing and seem to originate from an unusual force, perhaps a combination of electric and magnetic, or some type of subtle energy. They may even lead to dreams with symbolism that seems threatening. Questions explored include: What is kundalini? How or why is it experienced? How does it relate to body physiology? Why is kundalini believed to be some form of energy or energy transfer? What are some of the indicators of kundalini activation? What are the implications of kundalini for the physical sciences, particularly for our understanding of space-time and consciousness field concepts?\n\nI conclude with speculations on how kundalini effects can provide insight into the nature of reality and brain/mind connectivity.

Relational Quantum Mechanics (Rovelli, 1996) (RQM) and Consistent Histories (Griffiths, 2003) (CH) are discussed and related to the postulates. By dropping the assumption that unobserved macroscopic events are \"in a definite state\" determined independent of an observer, we arrive at a surprising but consistent theory of quantum macroscopic reality (with fewer fundamental assumptions about everyday reality) that does not contradict experiment or everyday experience. As a result, a concept herein termed \"retroactive event determination\" is identified as a quantum principle (in CH) and extended to a macroscopic principle. The implications of this on the flow of time, the phenomena of synchronicity and the question of fate versus free will are discussed.

In examining individual cases, the reasons for many appear unfair. Even in those who have completed the process and been awarded a PhD, the answer to the title question has been a resounding \"Yes!\" Many candidates are beset with endless rewrites, mentor changes, subject changes, and other delays that seem to have no apparent valid reasons. Many of these result in unwarranted repeated tuition payments. The PhD programs are filled with numerous research papers and comprehensive exams that require significant research activities. By the time one gets to the dissertation, the candidate is well versed in research activity.\n\nHowever, today's world is all about teams. In fact, many research funding organizations require a team approach with detailed credentials of all team members in order to get funding. The PhD process with current dissertation requirements does not prepare the candidate for team oriented research projects. There are ethical questions about this process; 1) Is it ethical to require a process that is antiquated and ill suited to the needs of the 21st Century, and 2) Is it ethical to require such credentials for employment in Universities, especially public institutions? My informal conversations with a large number of PhD's and PhD candidates, indicate there is a significant problem.\n\nI presented my preliminary findings at the Eleventh Annual Conference by the Faculty early this year at Utah Valley University. However, my paper could not be published with the proceedings as the IRB process was incomplete. It now is, and I am starting to interview individuals to validate the preliminary findings.\n\nTo date, it appears that many individuals with excellent talents are being eliminated from the research activity pool for reasons that have nothing to do with their ability.

The word 'dark' in these titles refers to the fact that whatever the physical substance or concept 'filling' these regions of otherwise empty space happens to be, it does not interact electromagnetically except for the fact that the curvature of space-time in these regions causes gravitational lensing of passing light waves. The best known dark region is the halo that surrounds spiral galaxies and it seems to be constituted of 'something' that goes by the designation Lambda-CDM. While the concept of Lambda-CDM seems to account for whatever either 'appears' or does not 'appear' in galactic halos, its origin and nature is otherwise unknown. The term DM also covers the group of physical phenomena associated with the HDM which persists everywhere throughout the universe as does DE. The verified existence of DM and DE has plunged the scientific world into a 'crisis' state that seems to indicate fundamental physics is expanding ever more rapidly toward a new scientific revolution. Their very existence presents problems which cannot be solved automatically by quantum theory, either in the form of quantum vacuum energy or newly invented particles, but rather problems that are related to gravity theory as expressed by the general theory of relativity. Numerous suggestions and hypotheses have been put forward to explain these dark 'things', but no particular hypothesis or resulting model has proven satisfactory and no model yet proposed in mainstream physics is able to explain both DM, in either let alone both of its forms of CDM or HDM, and DE even though most physicists agree that the two should have a single common explanation. Having said that, DM and DE can be easily explained by thinking outside the box of mainstream physics. A single field model that includes a fundamental change in Newtonian gravity theory, expanding three-dimensional space to four dimensions, forces the reality of an extrinsically curved four-dimensional space-time in general relativity. The extra term added to Newton's gravity can then be equated to the Lambda-CDM or 'quintessence' that has been added to Einstein's formula. Yet this new model is not without radical consequences for the rest of physics and science. Accepting this new model would mean accepting the existence of a macroscopically extended fourth space-like dimension that either directly or indirectly influences all of science, absolutely everything in the world. In other words, this new model will change every facet of physics and science to some extent and some of the changes will be quite startling. The dark part of physics is not just an add-on or ad hoc device for explaining esoteric new phenomena. The dark deals with the underlying substrate of physical reality itself and can thus be used to explain such diverse physical phenomena as consciousness, paranormal phenomena and survival, quantum entanglement and the very nature of the quantum itself. The dark is actually a realm of light that only 'appears' dark against the 'brighter' materiality of our normally sensed and normally experienced three-dimensional world.\n\nRecorded at the 29th annual SSE Conference in 2010 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

For several years, this group has been evolving from an informal table-tilting sitter group to a group more closely resembling the classic spiritualist seance groups in the late nineteenth century. In the past year, in particular, they have been reporting, not simply full table levitations, but also apported objects and apparent materializations. These latter phenomena occur primarily in the context of a \"cabinet\" seance, during which one of the sitters (now identified as a medium) sits in a curtained-off area of the seance room, occasionally opening the curtains to reveal ostensible materializations.\n\nI sat with this group for two sessions, a cabinet sitting and a table-tilting session. In the former, conducted almost entirely in darkness, I was presented with many of the classic spiritualist phenomena: including rapping sounds throughout the room, a levitating plastic trumpet with luminescent tape on one end floating around the room, and apparent materialized hands, some seeming to emerge from the medium's mouth under red light. In the table-tilting session, also conducted in darkness (but part of which was recorded in infrared high-definition video), we had vigorous table movements and one brief but apparently complete table levitation. At present, I'd have to say that nothing I witnessed either discourages or encourages suspicion. Fortunately, the group seems amenable to further investigations under tighter controls and more relentless infrared video recording.\n\nI'll discuss the phenomena in detail and show portions of the infrared video.\n\nDr. Braude is Chair of the Philosophy department at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Scientific Exploration.\n\nRecorded at the 29th annual SSE Conference in 2010 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.

Second, to heal using the Levashov Method of mental intention to scan and enter the etheric and astral bodies of Gwen's (fictitious name) subtle body structure and make corrections where needed. Coaching was provided by Dr. Surel and took place weekly since mid-January of 2010. Healing was provided by Dr. Blasband for 15 minute sessions three to five days per week during the same period.\n\nResults: Within one week of beginning treatment the galloping decreased 80-90%. Each healing session was followed by a marked diminution of her inner sense of \"urgency.\" Within two months of treatment she was hardly pacing at all and her ability to learn math had markedly improved as had her capacity for interpersonal relationships. The symptom of lack of feeling in the brain was eliminated with one healing session. A hiatus in healing of 5 days due to difficulties in the family resulted in a return of symptoms in full force. These were again alleviated with coaching and healing.\n\nConclusion: This single example of a young woman with Asperger's Syndrome treated by a coach and healer working in harmony demonstrates that it is possible to strongly influence the course of this usually refractory syndrome.

Unfortunately George Clooney became interested in the project and in 2009 released a movie of the same title. In the book, the participants are addressed by their real names, and I am one of the principal characters. The movie added a degree of ambiguity to the participants but claimed it was based on a true story, albeit portrayed as a comedy. While George Clooney's role is a composite of known personalities, as is Kevin Spacey's, Jeff Bridges who won multiple best actor awards for Crazy Heart, played a role directly based on Lt. Col. Jim Channon, creator of The First Earth Battalion.\n\nAnomalous phenomena are at the heart of the movie. The problem for the viewing public, and SSE members is that they would be unable to distinguish between fact and fantasy. The movie portrayed several phenomena including remote viewing, psychokinesis metal bending, mental weather modification (cloud-busting), and other events. Clooney even demonstrates a death by staring technique while a general officer, portraying my boss, attempts unsuccessfully to run through walls.\n\nIn reality, some of these events did happen. Goats did die, but due to dim mak, also known as the death touch, not by staring at them. The documentation was extraordinary and will be discussed. But more importantly, there were very practical and cogent reasons for exploring these fields when we did. Some of the experimentation came about as the result of the personal experiences of an American Special Forces officer held for five years as a prisoner of war in South Viet Nam. This presentation will set the record straight.\n\nRecorded at the 29th annual SSE Conference in 2010 in Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n\nJoin the SSE to support to support the Society’s commitment to maintain an open professional forum for researchers at the edge of conventional science: https://www.scientificexploration.org/join\n\nThe SSE provides a forum for original research into cutting edge and unconventional areas.
