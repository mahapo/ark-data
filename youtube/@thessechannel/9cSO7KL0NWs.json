side"},{"startMs":502440,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"opposite to the side of the lesion which"},{"startMs":505139,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"makes anatomical sense and they

that"},{"startMs":515339,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"was in our grant before we did the study"},{"startMs":517380,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"so it was an a priori hypothesis

the"},{"startMs":522839,"durationMs":3301,"subtitle":"research"},{"startMs":524099,"durationMs":6541,"subtitle":"and we used what's called Theta

30"},{"startMs":534240,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"minutes"},{"startMs":536220,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"and this is the way we designed it

we"},{"startMs":546600,"durationMs":6239,"subtitle":"we predicted it would have an effect"},{"startMs":549240,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"we had 36 who had a lesion put on

see"},{"startMs":571019,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"an effect in that group"},{"startMs":575580,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"so participants were in a

thing"},{"startMs":623940,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"should take you know but they get the"},{"startMs":626279,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"TMS then they got to do the

not"},{"startMs":1133160,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"this kind of TMS okay"},{"startMs":1135799,"durationMs":7681,"subtitle":"but there's tdcs which is
