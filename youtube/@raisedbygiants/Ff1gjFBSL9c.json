10"},{"startMs":309900,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"will turn into fulleries"},{"startMs":312479,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"and then that's where the hardest

food"},{"startMs":810000,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"just so the digestion works better"},{"startMs":812399,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"so that's kind of the recommended dose"},{"startMs":814560,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"is one tablespoon in the morning well it"},{"startMs":817620,"durationMs":5219,"subtitle":"matters for for like let's say for if"},{"startMs":819899,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"you weigh let's say let's say 1 10 to"},{"startMs":822839,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"140 or 50 right and you know that's"},{"startMs":825779,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"probably and you're in your mid-30s or"},{"startMs":828480,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"something you know 40s 30s 20s probably"},{"startMs":830699,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"a teaspoon will work for you"},{"startMs":832560,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"but if you're bigger or older like I'm"},{"startMs":834720,"durationMs":4619,"subtitle":"six one you know I'm down to 180 pounds"},{"startMs":837660,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and I got a little bit of gray hair

soon"},{"startMs":856320,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"yeah and that's probably about a"},{"startMs":858180,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"tablespoon right there yeah because a"},{"startMs":860760,"durationMs":5879,"subtitle":"two tablespoons is a shot glass"},{"startMs":864000,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"um so so but that but that's an

recommending"},{"startMs":888060,"durationMs":2899,"subtitle":"anybody to do this I'm just kind of"},{"startMs":889500,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"curious what would happen if

at"},{"startMs":897720,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"all is there anything well no well"},{"startMs":899639,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"obviously it's in an oil"},{"startMs":901440,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"so you're probably going to have a"},{"startMs":903120,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"digestive you know it's going to go out"},{"startMs":904380,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"the back side because your body can't"},{"startMs":906120,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"digest that much oil at one time

doing"},{"startMs":910860,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"that and uh they had like weird they"},{"startMs":913560,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"were claiming that they became"},{"startMs":914579,"durationMs":3181,"subtitle":"telepathic"},{"startMs":916079,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"because you know they their wife

so"},{"startMs":931100,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"so I'm not sure on that one but yeah he"},{"startMs":934620,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"had uh some pretty yet and a lot

doing"},{"startMs":949500,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"it works better"},{"startMs":951120,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"so and that's the first thing C60 does"},{"startMs":953220,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"it's an antioxidant"},{"startMs":954839,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"but it's really good at there's two

we"},{"startMs":1303080,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"don't work for a topical solution it's"},{"startMs":1305059,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"basically I like the avocado for

just"},{"startMs":1392659,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"completely eliminated the damage that"},{"startMs":1394400,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"was caused they use a chemical obviously"},{"startMs":1396500,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"to to cause that dimethyl sulfate to"},{"startMs":1398840,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"cause that problem but C60 completely"},{"startMs":1401120,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"eliminated didn't C60 doesn't interact"},{"startMs":1403280,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"with the chemical that's causing the"},{"startMs":1404360,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"problem it interacts kind of strengthens"},{"startMs":1406159,"durationMs":4441,"subtitle":"the cells and another thing your

stop"},{"startMs":2913720,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"they just flew by and took pictures but"},{"startMs":2916359,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"uh and so they have stuff like that

the"},{"startMs":3050400,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"thing aluminum foil well obviously it"},{"startMs":3052020,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"blew but it could come off of one of uh"},{"startMs":3054180,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"you know our spacecraft or did you know"},{"startMs":3056280,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"are there other spacecraft going to

yeah"},{"startMs":3068520,"durationMs":5579,"subtitle":"exactly and it's a surprise finding this"},{"startMs":3071280,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"year because uh decent descent stage"},{"startMs":3074099,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"crashed about 200 kilometers 1.2 miles"},{"startMs":3076920,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"away did this piece land here after that"},{"startMs":3080099,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"or was it blown by the wind yeah I could"},{"startMs":3082500,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"have been blown by the wind and

uh"},{"startMs":3092940,"durationMs":5159,"subtitle":"probes I think one of them's still"},{"startMs":3094200,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"working the The Rovers yeah the and and"},{"startMs":3098099,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"they were they only figured they would"},{"startMs":3099540,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"last three to six months before dust on"},{"startMs":3102180,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"their solar panels would overcome"},{"startMs":3104520,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"you know would be so dusty they couldn't"},{"startMs":3106500,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"get enough electricity but every now and"},{"startMs":3108780,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"then they found that the solar panels"},{"startMs":3110339,"durationMs":2941,"subtitle":"cleared themselves"},{"startMs":3111660,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and eventually figured out there was"},{"startMs":3113280,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"those dust devils that you know they"},{"startMs":3115020,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"filmed on Mars what's interesting"},{"startMs":3116940,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"because Mars atmosphere is like one"},{"startMs":3118500,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"percent that of the Earth or a little"},{"startMs":3120420,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"bit actually it's a little bit less it's"},{"startMs":3121859,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"uh there's no way physically it should"},{"startMs":3124500,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"be able to lift the dust off but when"},{"startMs":3126359,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"they'd studied dust devils on the earth"},{"startMs":3128339,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"they found that at the top of a dust"},{"startMs":3130319,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"devil there's a negative

positive"},{"startMs":3134460,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"charge"},{"startMs":3135300,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and so when that dust devil goes over"},{"startMs":3137280,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"the solar panel it actually gives all"},{"startMs":3139380,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"the dust particles this huge positive"},{"startMs":3141240,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"charge and that's what actually lifts"},{"startMs":3143099,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"them up off the panel and allows them to"},{"startMs":3145380,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"be sucked away and so and that's also"},{"startMs":3148020,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"something to do with anti-gravity that"},{"startMs":3150000,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"high positive charge at the bottom of"},{"startMs":3152099,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"tornadoes and dust devils is actually"},{"startMs":3153900,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"one of the reasons things lift"},{"startMs":3156240,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"and not and not just a physical motion"},{"startMs":3159000,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"of the air"},{"startMs":3160559,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"it's actually that positive charge on"},{"startMs":3162599,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"those objects lists helps lift them from"},{"startMs":3165599,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"the Earth's surface just like it lifts"},{"startMs":3167400,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"them from Mars because there's no way"},{"startMs":3168599,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"those dust particles should have been"},{"startMs":3170040,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"lifted by a dust devil on Mars but with"},{"startMs":3172380,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"the positive charge kind of giving it an"},{"startMs":3174599,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"extra boost it did"},{"startMs":3176339,"durationMs":5881,"subtitle":"it's interesting too that with the"},{"startMs":3178380,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"Rovers like uh we sent that first Rover"},{"startMs":3182220,"durationMs":6359,"subtitle":"up in what like 2011 or 2012 and now"},{"startMs":3186480,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"it's all of a sudden able to take"},{"startMs":3188579,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"selfies of itself"},{"startMs":3190440,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"oh well they they do they actually"},{"startMs":3192240,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"actually they take lots of pictures and"},{"startMs":3193740,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"then they pick they they use a 3D"},{"startMs":3197339,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"software to do that"},{"startMs":3199740,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"so they take a whole bunch of pictures"},{"startMs":3201240,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"then they like merge them together"},{"startMs":3203819,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"and they put the Rover in there too yeah"},{"startMs":3206880,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"they put the Rover because the Rover has"},{"startMs":3208319,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"a camera on the end of a thing so it"},{"startMs":3209760,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"could take like pictures everywhere but"},{"startMs":3212099,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"they we didn't have the software to"},{"startMs":3213420,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"actually do that all they could do back"},{"startMs":3214980,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"when they originally had those was just"},{"startMs":3216660,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"take the pictures right and so they"},{"startMs":3219180,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"figured well no no you can take a bunch"},{"startMs":3220800,"durationMs":3539,"subtitle":"of pictures and we will put it in our"},{"startMs":3222240,"durationMs":4859,"subtitle":"computer the 3D generator and it will"},{"startMs":3224339,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"make like a selfie photo of the thing"},{"startMs":3227099,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"and you don't see the the hands sticking"},{"startMs":3229020,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"out because they take you
