Here we have two short extracts from Pliny's magnum opus \"Naturalis Historia\", in which he describes what he knows of the people of Serica and its surroundings far to the east, and how they in turn affected the Rome he knew at the time. In the second extract he describes a mysterious people (who he again dubs \"Seres\") whom the people of \"Taprobane\" (modern day Sri Lanka) apparently crossed a mountain range to trade with.\n\nAs with our previous video on China, a lot of the locations (and indeed the peoples) mentioned are still debated by scholars. In the coming weeks we will further explore Ancient China's worldview, and descriptions they gave of other cultures that seemed wholly alien to them.

Arriving in Bremen in 1066 and soon falling under the tutelage of Archbishop Adalbert, who figures prominently in the narrative, Adam recorded the centuries-long campaign by his church to convert Slavic and Scandinavian peoples. His History vividly reflects the firsthand accounts he received from travelers, traders, and missionaries on the peripheries of medieval Europe.\n\nAs the bishops had jurisdiction over the missions to Scandinavia, it also gives a report of the Norse paganism of the period.\n\nThe existence of the work was forgotten in the later medieval period, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of Sorø Abbey, Denmark.\n\nHow do we actually know about history?

After John's death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, Edward I, repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's statute law.\n\nHow do we actually know about history?

The stage was set for one of the most pivotal moments of English history. The battle of Hastings. \n\nThis speech, attributed to William by the Anglo-Norman historian Henry of Huntingdon writing several decades later, is in all likelihood probably not one actually spoken by William, but is a fascinating glimpse into William’s reputation in the decades after the battle nonetheless. \n\nHow do we actually know about history?

On the eve of the battle with both armies waiting tensely for the conflict, the older man Hannibal calls Scipio to meet him and discuss terms of peace.

Here we have an extract from his Magnus Opus, 'The Anabasis' in which he describes encountering the ruins of two ancient cities as he and his men crossed Persia on their long journey home after taking part in a Persian civil war. He calls these cities Larisa and Mespila. Today they are generally assumed to have been ancient Assyrian cities, perhaps Nimrud and Nineveh, destroyed centuries earlier as the Neo-Assyrian Empire collapsed under the weight of its subject peoples, amongst them the Persian Achaemenids. Inspiring the famous Shelley poem 'Ozymandias', Xenophon describes the vast proportions of these ancient ruins; long deserted, looming large against the desert, a ruined shadow of a vast forgotten empire.\n\nHow do we actually know about history?

The year is 84, and Gnaeus Julius Agricola has finally goaded the Caledonians into battle, a tribe still clinging to independence in the cold north of the island. Much of Britannia has already been subjugated, along with Gaul, and absorbed into the voracious maw of the greatest empire the world has ever seen. Agricola's campaign comes to us through the words of Tacitus (56 - 120 AD), famous Roman historian. Here he gives us a speech from the leader of the Caledonian Confederation, the chieftain Calgacus, urging his followers to reject bondage and fight to their last against Roman slavery. He asks them to fight for their freedom.\n\nHow do we actually know about history?

Though the title is Latin, the work itself is written in Old English. The Sermo Lupi is Wulfstan's most well-known work. In it, he blames a lack of moral discipline amongst his fellow English as the source of God's anger against the English, which has taken the shape of thirty years of Viking raids against England. Wulfstan asks the English to behave in a manner more pleasing to God, and specifically to live according to the laws of the Church and of the king. The Sermo Lupi is noted for its rhetorical achievements, and is considered to represent the height of Wulfstan's skill as a homilist and rhetor.\n\nHistory Time is now a podcast.
