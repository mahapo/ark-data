Born in Calcutta in 1872, Aurobindo Ghose's early years were marked by a brilliant academic career in England, where he studied at Cambridge University. However, it was upon his return to India that he became deeply involved in the fight against British colonial rule. Aurobindo's powerful speeches and writings, filled with a sense of spiritual fervor, galvanized the masses and played a pivotal role in the movement for India's freedom.\n\nBut Sri Aurobindo's legacy extends far beyond politics. He is equally renowned for his profound spiritual contributions, particularly the development of Integral Yoga. After a transformative spiritual experience, he withdrew from active politics to explore the depths of human consciousness and the evolution of the soul. He founded the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, where seekers from around the world gathered to practice his teachings. Sri Aurobindo's philosophy emphasizes the synthesis of the spiritual and material realms, promoting a holistic approach to life. His writings, including \"The Life Divine\" and \"Savitri,\" continue to guide individuals on a path of self-discovery and spiritual evolution, making him a timeless figure in the realms of both politics and spirituality, leaving an indelible mark on India's history and the world at large.\n\n#sriaurobindo #spirituality #auroville\n\nScript: Janit Gambhir\n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nOriginal Score: Epidemic music x Original\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Known as 'Pratityasamutpada' in\rSanskrit, this tenet, often translated as 'Dependent Origination' or 'Dependent Arising', forms the\rbackbone of the Buddhist understanding of reality.\r\nThis principle, eloquently elucidated in various Buddhist texts and sutras, posits that all\rphenomena - the 'dharmas', do not occur in a vacuum. It negates the existence of independent,\rinherently existent entities. Instead, it proposes that each phenomenon arises, persists, and ceases\rdue to a network of interconnected causes and conditions. From the most momentous celestial\revents to the minutest atomic fluctuations, from the intricate web of biological life to the subtle\rstreams of thoughts and emotions, everything arises due to an intricate interplay of myriad\rfactors.\rUnderlying this sophisticated philosophical tenet is a deeper insight into the nature of existence:\rnothing stands alone, and everything is interconnected. '\n\nOur existence isn't isolated but intimately\rlinked to the world around us, entwined in an intricate dance of interdependence. The food we\reat, the air we breathe, the thoughts we think, all emerge out of and merge back into this\rinterconnected web of life. Our individuality is not a solitary, self-contained existence, but an\remergent property of the interrelations that we are part of.\rBuddhist teachings also reveal that misunderstanding this interconnectedness can lead to\r'Dukkha', often translated as suffering. The illusory perception of a separate, independent self can\rengender a sense of alienation, a feeling of isolation and loneliness, and a propensity to act out of\rselfishness, greed, and aggression, leading to suffering for oneself and others. On the contrary,\rrealizing this interconnectedness can lead to wisdom, compassion, and 'Nirvana', the cessation of\rsuffering.\r\n\nThis profound interconnectedness is beautifully encapsulated in the metaphor of 'Indra's Net', an\rimagery derived from the 'Avatamsaka Sutra' of Mahayana Buddhism. Envision a cosmic,\rmultidimensional net, spread infinitely in all directions, with a perfect jewel at each node. Each\r jewel, pristine and luminous, perfectly reflects every other jewel in the net. The reflection of one\rjewel contains the reflections of all other jewels, and those reflections contain all others ad\rinfinitum. This imagery paints a vivid picture of the infinite interconnectedness and\rinterpenetration of all phenomena.\n\n#quantumphysics #spirituality #hinduism #buddhism\n\n\nScript: Malcolm Grayson \n\nEdit: Medo\n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nOriginal Score: Epidemic Music x Original score\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Theoretical\rPhysics.\" Join us as we embark on an intellectual exploration, delving into the fascinating realms of\rBuddhism, Hinduism, and Quantum Physics. Throughout this captivating series, we will unravel the\rintricate tapestry of these ancient philosophical traditions and their intriguing connections to the realm of\rtheoretical physics.\r\n\nIn Part 1, we begin our quest by exploring the profound themes of emptiness. In parts 2, 3, and beyond,\rwe explore the themes of interconnectedness, time, space, and more. Prepare to expand your horizons\rand challenge your understanding as we navigate the rich landscapes of Indian philosophy and the\rcaptivating realm of Quantum Physics. Discover the striking parallels and nuanced differences that arise\rwhen these two seemingly disparate domains converge.\rIntroduction\rThe concept of \"emptiness\" is a profound and multifaceted idea that transcends the boundaries of ancient\rIndian philosophy and modern theoretical physics. It captures a fundamental aspect of existence,\rchallenging our conventional understanding of reality and inviting us to explore the nature of the universe\rand our place within it. This exploration of \"emptiness\" seeks to provide an enlightening perspective on\rthe perception of our reality, both materially and spiritually.\rIn ancient Indian philosophy, emptiness holds a central position, known as \"shunyata\" in Buddhism and\r\"maya\" in Hinduism.\n\n It denotes the absence of inherent, independent existence in all phenomena,\remphasizing the interdependence and impermanence of the world. This philosophical perspective\rencourages a profound inquiry into the nature of self, consciousness, and the illusory nature of reality,\rpointing towards the interconnectedness of all things and the transient nature of our existence.\rSimultaneously, the realm of modern theoretical physics presents a similar concept of emptiness. Objects,\ratoms, and even the constituents of atoms, are predominantly empty space. The microscopic structure of\rmatter, as revealed by scientific exploration, challenges our intuitive notion of solidity. It showcases the\rintricate interplay between particles, energy fields, and wave-like properties that shape the fabric of the\runiverse, forcing us to question the solidity and permanence of the world around us.\n\nScript: Malcolm Grayson\n\nEdit: Medo\n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

These sacred scriptures narrate the story of Amitābha, the celestial \rBuddha of Infinite Light, who makes a profound and transformative vow. He pledges to create a \rPure Land, a realm devoid of suffering and obstacles, where beings can diligently strive for\renlightenment. Imagine a place where the pursuit of liberation from the unending cycle of birth\rand death, known as Samsara, can occur without hindrance - a realm where the constant\rstruggle to escape from the wheel of life and death is replaced with the serene pursuit of\renlightenment.\rThis celestial realm, lovingly referred to as the Pure Land or Sukhāvatī, is often depicted as an\rabode of ultimate peace, beauty, and bliss. \n\nHere, the Dharma, the teachings of the Buddha, are\rubiquitous, permeating every corner of existence. This is a realm where beings are free from the\rThree Poisons - raga (greed), dvesha (hatred), and moha (delusion). In this realm, these\rhindrances to the attainment of Nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, are absent, and\rall beings are on the unwavering path towards enlightenment.\rKey Concepts and Practices\rCentral to the practice of Pure Land Buddhism is the meditative repetition known as Nianfo or\rNembutsu. Practitioners, referred to as jingtu in Chinese or jodo in Japanese, repeatedly recite \rthe phrase 'Namo Amituofo' or 'Namo Amitābhāya.' \n\nThis is more than just a chant - it's a solemn\rinvocation of the name of Amitābha Buddha, an expression of faith, and a fervent aspiration for\rrebirth in the Pure Land.\rPure Land Buddhism beautifully encapsulates the essence of the Mahayana tradition. It places\remphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal, the lofty aspiration to attain enlightenment not just for\roneself, but for the benefit of all sentient beings. This tradition offers a practical solution for\rthose who find the arduous path of self-powered enlightenment daunting amidst the trials and\rtribulations of Samsara.\n\n#buddhism #purelandbuddhism #enlightenment #namoamituofo \n\nScript: Malcolm Grayson\n\nVoiceover: Andrea Giordani\n\nMusic- Epidemic Music & original score\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

One of India’s most revered saints he once held a sword to his neck in his endless devotion towards the goddess Kali. He rolled around naked, rebuked social behaviour, got lost in states of trance, and broke endless expectations. He lost control of his body and mind, not once or twice but several times. Many believed that madness had gripped him. \nGadadhar later came to be known as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, a mystic and spiritual leader.  He tried all sects of Hinduism, converted to Islam, then Christianity, and later died of throat cancer, but not without leaving a thriving order of people dedicated to his cause. Was he really mad or so divine that it is beyond rational understanding? Do even the saintliest of all people have madness within them? How do you explain this life full of miracles, madness, and ecstasy?\n\nEarly Childhood and Initial ecstasies\n\nIn a small village of Bengal, in the middle of palm trees, ponds, and rice fields, called Kamarkupur, there lived an orthodox Brahmin couple – the Chattopdhyayas. Living their life in poverty they were stern devotees of Rama. The father at the age of sixty went on a pilgrimage to Gaya. In Gaya, lord Vishnu visited him and said, “I am about to be reborn for the salvation of the world”. \nMoreover, if you don’t believe in coincidences and their messages, that might change. Around the same time that the man was visited by Vishnu, the woman was being graced by the almighty Shiva back in Kamarkupur. The divine image of Shiva in a temple opposite her cottage came to life right in front of her eyes.  The woman – Chandramani was overwhelmed and suddenly fainted. She conceived by the grace of god and heard voices – that she carried a God. \nThe child who would later be known as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was born on February 18, 1836. He was called Gadadhar Chattopadhyaya. Although the parents had been overwhelmed with visions before his birth, the child’s life till the age of six was as ordinary as it could be. Then one day in the summer of 1884, as he was munching a small ball of rice, he saw a great black cloud spreading rapidly until he was covered with them overhead, and he experienced his first spiritual ecstasy. In Ramakrishna’s own words, he explained later – \n“Suddenly at the edge of the clouds, a flight of snow-white cranes passed over my head. The contrast was so beautiful that my spirit wandered far away. I lost consciousness and fell to the ground. The puffed rice was scattered. Somebody picked me up and carried me home in their arms. An excess of joy and emotion overcame me… This was the first time that I was seized with ecstasy.” \n\n#ramakrishnaparamahamsa #vedanta #swamivivekananda #spirituality \n\nScript: Riya \n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nEdit: Harsh\n\nOriginal Score: Epidemic music x Original score\n\nSource:\nRolland Romain, ‘Prophets of The New India’, Cassell and Company Ltd, London. \nMaharaj Ayon, ‘Infinite Paths to Infinite Reality: Sri Ramakrishna & Cross-Cultural Philosophy of Religion, Oxford University Press, New York.\n‘Life of Sri Ramakrishna: Compiled from Various Sources’, Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himachal Pradesh. \nShourie Arun, ‘Two Saints: Speculations Around and About Ramakrishna Paramahamsa & Ramana Maharishi’, HarperCollins Publishers, India.\nMcConnel Marion Mugs, ‘Letters from the Yoga Masters’, North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California. \nGupta Mahendranath, Disciples, Trans.

Put together this\rwould roughly translate into a ‘collected state of being’ or a ‘concentrated state of being’.\rSamadhi often refers to the perfection of the processes of meditation, even at times as the\rsupreme goal of meditation practice. In Buddhism Samadhi is seen as a door to Enlightenment.\rIn the state of Samadhi, the meditator and the meditation become one. So does the thinker and\rthe thought, the worshipper and the worshipped, or the Prakriti (प्रकृति)and the Purusha (पुरुष). It\ris when the mind gains ekagrata (एकाग्रता) or one-pointedness. This is the final step in Yoga.\rWhen all mental modifications cease to exist. Seems like a blissful state doesn’t it? Relieved\rfrom all doubt, restlessness, and ignorance, while gaining higher knowledge or insight – Vigyan\r(विज्ञान) or vivek (विवेक). Liberation from human suffering.\rBut it’s one thing to understand it theoretically and another to practically get there. Well before\rwalking the path to the door to enlightenment there are some preparations to be made.\rFirst things first – Eliminating Klesas or afflictions\r“ तपःस्वाध्ययेश्वरप्रनिधानानि क्रियायोगः” – II.1\r“समाधिभवनार्थः क्लेश्तानूकरणार्थश्च” – II.2\r(Tapah-swadhyayesvara-pranidhanani kriya-yogah)\r(Samadhi-bhavanarthah klesa-tanu-karanarthashcha)\rYogic action has three components – discipline (tap - तप), self–study (swadhyaya - स्वाध्याय), and\rorientation toward the ideal of pure awareness ( Ishwara pranidhaan – इश्वर प्रणिधान) or selfsurrender.\r– II.1\rIts purposes are to disarm the causes of suffering (Klesh) and achieve integration (Samadhi).-\rII.3\rSo what are these afflictions and how does one get rid of them to walk the path which goes to\rSamadhi? Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras highlights five afflictions of the body, emotions, and mind.\rThese afflictions are ignorance (avidya – अविद्या ), egoism (asmita - अस्मिता), attachment (raga -\rराग), repulsion (dwesh - द्वेष), and clinginginess to life (abhinivesha – अभिनिवेश). Patanjali also\rexplains, that the purpose of yoga is to disarm these afflictions and achieve Samadhi.\rThese five afflictions are not fundamental to a specific religion or culture but are deeply rooted\rin human existence. Every person’s body and mind are inflicted with these. The first two –\rignorance, and egoism or a sense of one’s own individual self are afflictions of the mind. It is\rthrough ignorance that a person mistakes the real for the unreal, the self for the non-self. Most of\rus spend so much of our lives believing that we are nothing more than our bodies and our minds.\n\n#samadhi #enlightenment #nirvana #spirituality \n\nScript: Riya\n\nEdit: Harsh\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nScore: Epidemic music x Orignal score\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

In a general\runderstanding of the term, Guna may refer to the fundamental characteristic that defines an\rentity. Guna is the fluidity of water, the hotness of fire, the whiteness of milk, and the sweetness\rof honey. It is the personality or attitude of a person that defines their personhood. A person may\rbe kind, aggressive, punctual, lethargic, truthful, or have many other traits that are said to be\rqualities of that person. Hence the concept of gunas as an attribute of a thing entails that it is\rdependent on the object and defines its essence. As they describe reality, they form the\rfundamental building blocks of the universe, the material world, and the human personality. The\rGunas determining the different aspects of life, creation, relationships, and knowledge have been\rwell explored in ancient philosophical texts. Broadly, they can be seen in the cosmic aspect, as a\rpart of personality, in the societal aspect, and from a rational-scientific point of view.\n \n \n\rGunas as constituents of Prakriti, the creative force\rAll things in the cosmos exist in duality: the masculine and feminine, the yin and the yang, the\rmind and the body. The Samkhya school of Indian philosophy visualises this duality in the form\rof Purusha and Prakriti. Purusha represents the conscious but passive aspect of reality, whereas\rPrakriti represents the unconscious but creative aspect. It is the power that gives birth to\reverything. Gunas are the constituents of this Prakriti.\nThey can be classified into three types: Sattva , Raja, and Tama. Tha Sattva Guna is goodness,\rbliss, and enlightenment. It is buoyant, bright, and illuminating . The Raja guna is the principle\rof motion and energy. It is restlessness, desire, activity, effort, and pain. Tama Guna consists of\rdarkness, apathy, ,indifference, ignorance, and lethargy. It is the quality of heaviness, negativity,\rconfusion, and passivity. In Prakriti, all three gunas are present in harmonious balance. When\rPrakriti, the feminine, comes into contact with Purusha, the masculine, the equilibrium of the\rGunas within Prakriti is disturbed. The Raja Guna begins to dominate, compelling other gunas to\rengage in activity as well.As a result, material products start evolving out of Prakriti, and\rcreation occurs. Each product of creation contains all three gunas (sata, raja, and tama), although\rin different proportions, resulting in the diversity of the phenomenal world. The plants, animals,\relements of nature, and even human beings show a diversity in characteristics corresponding to\rdifferent combinations of the three gunas. Every phenomenon contains a predominant guna, as\rwell as a smaller dose of the other two gunas. That is why, for instance, anger can be transformed\rinto compassion because the rajas state of anger contains some sattva, the predominant guna of\rcompassion. Besides the cosmic explanation given by Samkhyan philosophy, Gunas have a\rpractical use. They can be said to influence our daily lives through personal development,\runderstanding relationships and psychology, cultivating habits, and managing our desires. The\rBhagavad Gita explains the types of personalities due to the Gunas and how one should manage\rthem.\n\n#gunas #hinduism #bhagavadgita  #vedas \n\nStarting parable: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna\n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nEdit: Harshit\n\nScore: Original x Epidemic music x Motion array\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Aghora therefore symbolizes a style of life\rwhere a person of the Aghori tradition doesn't have intense or deep feelings. It does not\rdistinguish between various emotions and seems to be indifferent to the various stories of life.\r1\rThe Aghoris are believed to be descended from earlier Saivite ascetic orders.2 These\rascetics considered themselves to be Shiva's cattle, and believed Shiva would assist them in\rfreeing themselves from the bondage of the earthly realm.3 Aghori is the one who follows the\rpath of the Aghora. \n\nA path of evolution and spiritual realization that starts from the most\ranimalistic, grossest aspects of the human being and stage after stage evolves into what can be\r \rcalled a liberated soul. They stand for the left-ha 4 nded route to salvation, or vampanthi. The\r dakshinpanthi, or right hand path, is its opposite and comprises universal spiritual practises like\rmeditation, prayer, and bhakti that were taken from the early Vedic writings. The Vampanthi, on\rthe other hand, stand for peculiar habits that society sometimes views as inappropriate and immoral. Their ceremonies are frequently contrasted with western occultism.\r\n.\rThese aspects also distinguish them from other Hindu sects.5 Because these sadhaks often do not\rcare about anything but the ultimate, they are often disinclined to act as per the conventional\r\"spiritual\" role.\n\n#spirituality #aghori #tantra #meditation #aghora #kali #shiva \n\nVoiceover: Abhinav Banerjee\n\nScore: Original x Epidemic music x Motion Array\n\nEdit: Aakash Chauhan\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

As a process, bhakti is complete subservience to the divine will, and as an outcome, it is an end in itself. The purpose of devotion is neither wish fulfillment nor any higher purpose such as liberation or salvation; it is a simple concept of unconditional love towards the object of devotion, which may be a theistic God, an impersonal god, a living being, or even a thought or emotion.\n This love knows no expectations, fears, or rivals. It expects nothing in return and is purely unconditional. The sole purpose of loving is to immerse oneself in an unending stream of divine love. Love does not emerge out of fear; one does not love in order to avoid hell, but rather in the face of love, concepts of heaven, hell, sin, karma, and liberation are all transcended. One becomes passive in their actions as there is complete surrender towards the beloved; all actions are guided by intense love. Love of Bhakti has no rival. A person who is truly in love will see the object of their love as the highest ideal. It may be that in many cases human love is misdirected and misplaced; however, to the person who loves, the thing they love is always their highest ideal.\n\nThe ancient treatise on Bhakti- the Narada Bhakti sutra explains the essence of Bhakti in its opening lines-\nIt is of the nature of the highest love for this oneAnd of the nature of the immortal blissOn attaining which a man becomes perfect immortal and satisfied forever.On gaining which one wants nothing, laments over nothing, hates nothing, delights in nothing, and is never enthusiastic in anything earthly.Experiencing which one becomes exhilarated beyond self control, stands perfectly still, and revels in the self. [2-6]\n\n\nThe notion of love is central to the idea of Bhakti. This love is an emotional, intense, and passionate longing for the beloved, not limited to the realm of physical or sexual desire. It involves an intense contemplation such that the lover and beloved seem to become one. There is an annihilation of separateness - a dissolution of the distinction between \"me\" and \"not-me.\" Unless the union is with the entirety of creation, the distinction will persist. Hence, in Bhakti, the beloved is the Supreme itself - the one who is both creator and creation. The identification of self with the Supreme occurs, leading to complete fulfillment, satisfaction, desirelessness, and eternal bliss.\n\n#bhaktiyoga #spirituality #bhakti #hinduism \n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nScore: Epidemic music x Motion array x Original Score\n\nScript: Ankit Kumar\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

The concept is beautifully described in a stanza of book eight of Light of Asia by Sir Edwin Arnold:\nThat which ye sow ye reap. See yonder fields!\nThe sesamum was sesamum, the corn Was corn.\nThe Silence and the Darkness knew! \nSo is a man’s fate born\n\nHere the present circumstances of a person are termed as fate. But this fate is not an arbitrary assignment. It is the result of our past actions. Just as a seed grows into a plant, our past actions fructify into our current circumstances which we have to bear and term it as fate. It is neither God’s injustice nor demonic mischief that we face evil. Our suffering is due to our own actions. Further our current actions determine the conditions of the future. Hence we ourselves determine our own destiny. Good begets good and vice versa.\nBut this philosophical conception has a flaw and is still incomplete. We often see that there is injustice in this world. Very often Corrupt and Powerful get away with serious crimes while innocents suffer. This experiential fact does not sit well with the law of Karma. This is where the metaphysical concept of rebirth comes in.\n\n\n\nKarma in Religion- Rebirth and Bondage.\nRebirth is one of the central tenets of Indian religious teachings. It refers to the idea that the soul can begin a new life after the death of its physical body, in another body. The impressions of Karma called samskaras can transfer from one life to the next. Hence, if someone seems to be suffering disproportionately, then it can be explained by their bad deeds in past lives. Similarly if misdeeds of a person remain unaccountable in the present life, one can be sure that Karma will catch up in the next life. Karma is not only the action and its consequences, it is also the force that assigns the fruits of actions to the individuals. Karma is impartial, unbiased and devoid of empathy. It simply acts as a rule follower without any favour or ill will towards its recipients.\nDuring one’s lifetime, one performs actions and accumulates its fruits. These are borne in the next life but again by the virtue of performing actions, the cycle repeats itself. Gautama, the Buddha identified this Vicious cycle and named it samsara chakra which is a form bondage of the self. It is easy to see why. Consider an analogy. You are stuck in a time loop like the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. You wake up every day which can be seen as analogous to being born. You live throughout the day and when you sleep it is equivalent to death. Repeating this cycle everyday without any memory of the previous day would result in an endless monotony. Present day existential philosophers may recognise it as an existential angst-a process without a purpose. In the context of multiple lives lived through rebirth, this despair can intensify to even a greater degree from which even death cannot save. Because of this sense of entrapment, this endless cycle is termed as bondage.\n\n#karma #spirituality #lawofkarma #vedanta \n\nScript: Ankit Kumar\n\nScore: Medo\n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nOriginal Score: Motion array, epidemic music & Original soundstracks\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Spiritual descriptions. Political descriptions, etc..\nThese descriptions create their own rules and logic contained within themselves.\n\nLike games.\n\nThe rules & logic of the scientific language game are very different from the rules & logic of the spiritual language game.\n\nWhen one language game makes claims to be superior to another language game to know really What Is - there can only be contradiction and conflict.\n\nNaturally … the rules & logic of the games are different.\n\nNo language games can reveal to us what a single thing IS.\n\nThe French philosopher, Jacques Derrida, pointed out a very similar idea.\n\nDerrida said that no word is ever identical to its referent. Meaning that no word reveals what anything IS.\n\nInstead, the meaning of the word is created in its difference from other words.\n\nThe word “dog” does not have meaning because it tells us what a “dog” IS but rather the word “dog” has meaning only because it is different from the word “cat” - and, of course, millions of other words.\n\nDerrida said we can see this very clearly when we try to define any word.\n\nJust for a moment try to define where you are.\n\nYou might start with your city. Where is that?\n\nYou might say my city is in my country. The Planet. The Solar System. The Universe.\n\nPretty soon you run out of referents!\n\nIn Thailand the cultural ideal or superior character to demonstrate in public is a person with very deep “Jai Dee” - that is a person who shows in all situations, even in incredibly stressful ones, that they have a “cool heart,” or lack of reactivity.\n\nThis is because in Thai society the Buddhist notion of Anatman or No Self is very important. And, has over many centuries, filtered down into the culture & society.\n\nTherefore, the person who demonstrates a lack of Self or Self-interest through a “cool heart” is showing themselves to be of superior character, or highly ethical. \n\nOne can see why displays of anger in Thailand (and many other Eastern countries) are considered the actions of a very lowly-evolved person.\n\nThere is, however, a third type of ethics.\n\nAnd, it finds its grounding in Not Knowing.\n\nIn Taoism ethics are based on natural spontaneity.\n\nFor the Taoist there is a very simple formula for ethical action:\n\nWithout the referents; without the “language game” of referents, where are you?\n\nYou don’t know!\n\n#taoism #spirituality #vedanta #zen \n\nVoiceover: Andrea Giordani\n\nEditor: Medo\n\nScript: Matt Mackane\n\nScore: Epidemic Music x Original score\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

One without a second.\n\nBoth the sense of separate self and the apparent world are both absorbed into Nondual Source.\n\nAccording to this Nondual approach along with the separate sense of self, all personal preferences are seen through as illusory and re-absorbed into the Nondual Source.\n\nThe Law of Attraction also posits a Source of existence.\n\nHowever, The Law of Attraction does not teach that the separate sense of self is to be transcended in Source.\n\n\n#lawofattraction #spirituality #nonduality \n\nScript: Matt Mackane\n\nVoiceover: Andrea Giordani\n\nEditor- medo\n\nScore: Epidemic Music, Motion Array & Original x Drysaa\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

And all became.’ Moses heard this very sound on Mount Sinai, when in communion with God; and the same word was audible to Christ when absorbed in his heavenly Father in the wilderness. Shiva heard [AUM] during his Samadhi in . . . the Himalayas. This sound is the source of all revelation to the masters. . . . It is because of this that they know and teach one and the same truth.” Thus observes HAZRAT INAYAT KHAN, in The Music of Life.\n\nAUM is God’s Consciousness in creation. According to Paramahansa Yogananda, AUM is not an abstract principle, it is a scientific way of understanding and merging with the Divine Cosmic energy in the universe. “Through the actual hearing of this Cosmic Vibration, a conscious contact with God or Christ Consciousness can be established. Hence, in order to scientifically contact God, one must reach Him first through AUM” (Cornell 14).\nParamahamsa Yogananda says:\n“I want to get this matter completely settled into your consciousness, that while prayer and meditation are good, and we should practice, we must not forget that the purpose of meditation is to receive this Holy Ghost. No one, if he doesn’t know the AUM vibration, can get there. That is all there is to it” (Cornell 12). \n\nThe Philosophy of Sound- Mantra Yoga\n\nMantra can be said to be the highest form of philosophy because it provides the concentrated form of language necessary to embody the highest truths beyond our physical reality. David Frawley remarks that Mantra is a deeper level of speech that reflects the laws of the universe, what is called dharma, 'that which upholds', in Sanskrit. Mantra is the 'language of dharma' that enables us to understand what dharma is and how it works. That is why in Mantra Yoga different sounds correspond to the natural and spiritual forces through which the universe operates, starting with Om itself as the cosmic word (Frawley 45).\n\nMantra Yoga provides us a means to understand the sacred sound from the perspective of a tradition that has taken it beyond mysticism into an organized and codified spiritual science. Mantra Yoga includes a study of the qualities inherent in sound itself, through which words and meanings are properly formed. It shows how sounds impact the nervous system, mind and heart, and how we can modify them to improve our lives. Regardless of which background or tradition you may personally follow, the insights provided in Mantra Yoga can be of enormous value to enable you to manifest your destiny creatively, effectively and completely through understanding the power of the Word, says Frawley (26).\n\n#spirituality #mantra #aum #om #yoga \n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nEdit: Medo\n\n References:\nAlper, Harvey P.

The more power we have access to, the\rmore we can manifest in our creations. This is not the power we see externally—such as money\rand material things. Prana is the power we hold from within ourselves that values more than\rwhat we have in this mundane world. With the right techniques from the traditional wisdom of\rthe Sages, prana can bring out our endless creativity, wonder and intelligence.\nAccording to tradition, prana is considered the most direct living expression of the infinite—\rwhich is the sacred that permeates all of life.\n\nIn Tantra, which is closely linked with Hatha Yoga, both cultivate power and auspiciousness.\rTantra states that power, or prana, is necessary to achieve genuine happiness, spiritual\rfulfillment, and worldly success.\nThe work of Tantra is to burn through the limitations that bind our perception and disallows us\rfrom experiencing and seeing an all-encompassing Divinity that we are all entitled to do.\rScientific research describes prana as complex multidimensional energy, a combination of\relectrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, photonics, and ocular energies.\n\nThere are five main Vayus to talk about, which are most effective\rand efficient to practice and know of because they have specific locations, actions, functions,\rasana poses, and breathing strategies. The five Vayus are: Apana Vayu, Samana Vayu, Pran Vayu,\rUdana Vayu, and Vyana Vayu.

It was as early as 1920s that people close to her began to realize the essence of Mother Divine in her, and started calling her ‘Mataji’ or often, just ‘Ma’. It was one of her early disciples, called Bhaiji, who gave her the title of ‘Ma Anandamayi’, meaning, ‘Mother, full of Bliss’. Soon, people all over the country and from different quarters of the world who flocked to her for spiritual illumination started calling her Anandamayi Ma, or ‘Bliss-permeated Mother’.\n\nBirth and Early Life\nOn April 30, 1896, in a remote rural village of Kheora in East Bengal, a girl child was born to a poor but devout Vaishnava Brahmin couple. They named her ‘Nirmala Sundari’, meaning ‘immaculate beauty’, or ‘Taintless Beauty’.\nAccording to Prof. Bithika Mukherjee, the principal biographer of Anandamayi Ma, she was a very detached child right from early years, showing little interest in her surrounding environment. People often thought she was intellectually challenged (Aymard 11). \nBut this detachment did not mean any withdrawal from life. Nirmala Sundari was indeed a very happy child. She communed with animals and trees, like St Francis of Assissi, and often fell into spiritual trances. \nAt the age of 13, Nirmala Sundari was married to a much older person, Ramani Mohan Chakravarty. He later became her disciple, and she called him ‘Bholanath’, one of the names for Lord Shiva. \nMa went through her marriage life with complete commitment, treating her husband like a devoted wife. But she never consummated her marriage with sexual union or procreation. It is said that whenever the thoughts of physical attraction and lust occurred to her husband, Ma’s body would assume the terrible and awe-inspiring form of the Goddess Kali, and the poor husband would retreat in submission and guilt. \nBholanath was troubled and frustrated at first, but was gradually convinced that his wife was in fact a manifestation of the Divine Mother. He later took spiritual initiation from his wife and began to relate to her as his guru. In a remarkable reversal from the perspective of dharmasastra, or the Hindu code, he spent the rest of his life as his wife's disciple, caring for her physical well-being, as she seemed completely uninterested in her body, and mediating between her and her growing number of devotees\n\n#anandamayima #spirituality #yoga #mantra #vedanta #srianandamayima #paramahansayogananda #kriyayoga #autobiographyofyogi \n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nScript: Shaiju Koottucheradil Chacko\n\nEditor: Medo\n\nScore: Epidemic Music\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Jung, among others, estimated that they spent ¾ of their lives doing this.\n\nAnd, like the New Zealand Maori, the Australian Aborigine did not use any psychoactive plants to assist them.\nInstead, the way in which they cultivated a higher consciousness was exclusively through the practice of art.\n\nStory, music, song, dance & painting were the methods that Australian Aborigines used.\n\nAll of these were practised and performed so that they might more deeply dwell in what they knew as: The Dreaming.\n\n\nThe Dreaming\n\nThe Dreaming: The now-moment, beyond the historical, always Now, only apparently Then.

Hence, yoga implies a spiritual union of the individual consciousness with the allpervading,\runiversal Consciousness, or Brahman, according to the Upanishads. In this way,\ryoga is the empirical part of religion, says Gopi Krishna in his work, Kundalini- The Secret of\rYoga (3).\rOf all the different yoga traditions and schools that developed in ancient Vedic times,\rKundalini Yoga is considered to be the most powerful and therefore, the most dangerous. It is\rpart of the Shaiva Tantra system.\n\n Kundalini is considered to be a form of sacred feminine\renergy that lies dormant at the base of the human spine, called mooladhara, like a serpent.\rThis is pure, formless energy which has immense potential if awakened. Shaiva tantra calls\rthis energy or ‘shakti’ Mother Divine, or formless aspect of the Goddess.\rSwami Satyananda Saraswathi, a great master of Kundalini yoga and author of\rKundalini Tantra says that though you may be generally aware of what Yoga is, you require\rsome kind of awareness of what Tantra is in order to appreciate the mysterious working of\rKundalini yoga.\r\n\nTantra says that the range of mental experience can be broadened. With the help of the\rsenses, your mind can have an experience based on an object. There can be an experience\rwithin the framework of time, space, and object, but there can also be an experience beyond\rthe framework of time, space, and object. The second form of experience can happen when\rthe present mind expands beyond its given definitions and borders, and when this experience\roccurs, energy is released from yourself (Saraswati 6). This concept is the Tantric base of\rKundalini yoga.\n\nThe dormant Kundalini energy, when awakened, will rise in a spiralling motion up\rthrough different phases in the body called ‘Chakras’. The literal meaning of ‘chakra’ is\r‘circle’ but in the context of Kundalini tantra, it also connotes a vortex-like motion. There are\rmany chakras in a human body, but the principal ones within the body are six, and the highest\rone, the seventh, is at the crown of the head.\rThe mind of a worldly man with base desires and passions moves in the Muladhara\rand Svadhishthana Chakras or centers situated near the anus and the reproductive organ\rrespectively.\rIf one’s mind becomes purified, the mind rises to the Manipura Chakra or the center\rin the navel and experiences some power and joy.\n\n\rIf the mind becomes more purified, it rises to the Anahata Chakra, or the center in the\rheart, experiences bliss, and visualizes the effulgent form of the Ishta Devata or the tutelary\rdeity.\rWhen the mind gets highly purified, when meditation and devotion become intense\rand profound, the mind rises to Visuddha Chakra, or the center in the throat and experiences\rmore and more powers and bliss. Even when the mind has reached this center, there is a\rpossibility for it to come down to the lower centers.\n\n#kundaliniyoga #spirituality #chakras #kundaliniawakening \n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nScript: Shaiju Koottucheradil Chacko\n\nEditor: Medo\n\nScore: Epidemic Music\n\nReferences:\r1.

It is also known as Kāṭhaka Upanishad, and is listed as number 3 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads.\n\nThe Katha Upanishad consists of two chapters (Adhyāyas), each divided into three sections (Vallis). The first Adhyaya is considered to be of older origin than the second. The Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa–the son of Sage Vajasravasa ( also known as  Aruni Auddalaki Gautama), who meets Yama (the Hindu deity of death). Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Atman (Soul, Self) and moksha (liberation).\n\nThe chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested, with Buddhism scholars stating it was likely composed after the early Buddhist texts (fifth century BCE), and Hinduism scholars stating it was likely composed before the Buddha, in 800 BCE. \n\nLets go back in History as we explore the sacred teachings of Vendanta.

Vivekananda became popular after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words \"Sisters and brothers of America...,\" before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that one American newspaper described him as “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament”.[12] After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies throughout the US and the West.\n\n#swamivivekananda  #vedantany #spirituality  #vedanta #vivekananda \n\nVoiceover: Mike Davison\nAnimation: ay_studio\nOriginal Score: Rajat Prasanna\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

They are often mysterious and enigmatic. People generally chant these hymns without understanding their meaning. But that is really insignificant. Because, the truth is, the power of mantras lies not in their meaning, but in their sound! It is the very act of chanting that bestows power on these sacred hymns!\nMantra literally means an utterance. It is a sound or a syllable. According to Sadhguru, one of the most renowned modern-day practitioners of Mantra Yoga, mantras are impulses or rhythms of the consciousness. They create vibrations in the spirit. Their effects, influence, method, and mode of working are all a mystery. \nModern science too sees the whole of existence as reverberations of energy, at different levels of vibrations. If there are vibrations, there are sounds. That would mean that the whole existence could be understood in terms of sound too. Vedic science looks at the universe and human existence as a big amalgamation of various levels of sounds or mantras. Among these multiple sounds, some are identified as the key sounds. If you can identify them and master them and absorb them into your daily life, they will become your keys to opening up a higher level of consciousness within you. This is the rationale behind the secret science of mantra yoga.\n\n [Origin of Mantras]\nMantras originated with the great ancient teachings of India called Vedas. The Rig Veda, the oldest and the most central Vedic text, contains most of the mantras. According to David Frawley, the great scholar in Vedic literature, the Rig Veda is the fountainhead of Vedic science, the ancient spiritual science of the Himalayas from which such systems as Yoga, Vedic astrology (Jyotish), and Ayurveda (traditional Indian Medicine) arose. It is the basis of the Sanskrit language and culture. It is also the oldest book in any Indo-European language. There is a general recognition that the mantric or sound power of the Vedic chants in the Sanskrit language is the most sacred and mysterious power that human language has ever achieved.\nAccording to the Vedic tradition, the mantras have their origin in Lord Shiva himself. Om Swami recounts a story about it in his book:\nOut of compassion for all living beings across the universes, Bholenath, that is, Lord Shiva, merrily raised his damaru or drum and began playing it. As he danced to its heady rhythm, millions of sounds spread in the sky like stars in space. Every time the string of the damaru swooshed through the air, it created a sound. Many other sounds of different frequencies were produced when the beads at the end of the string would strike the damaru heads. Shiva’s moving hands and feet too created sounds. His swaying matted locks, the sound of rudraksha beads around his wrists, the slithering cobra around his neck ... every movement gave birth to a sound. And each sound was a mantra representing the feminine, masculine or neutral aspect of creation. From his kundala or ear-loops, originated the seed syllables of kundalini. \n\n#mantra #chanting #spirituality #vedanta #sadhguru\n\nEditor: Medo\n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nEditor: Pratik C Ramteke \n\nScript: Shaiju Koottucheradil Chacko\n\nSources:\nAlper, Harvey P.

What has become known simply as the \"Yoga Sutras\" (sutra means thread) or  the \"Yoga Darshana\" (the vision of Yoga), is actually a compendium of an ancient pre-existing oral yoga tradition consisting of both practical advice and theoretical context. \nThe most accepted format of the Yoga Sutras consists of four chapters (called padas) written in the Sanskrit language approximately 2000 years ago in Northern India while utilizing the terminology of the time, i.e., Samkhya philosophical system. The dates ascribed to the Yoga Sutras vary widely from 250 BC to 300 AD.\n\nPatanjali’s ‘Yoga-sutras’ are the first systematic and authoritative presentations of yoga in both its theoretical and practical aspects. \nFollowed by Patanjali, Vasys’s “Yoga–bhasya” and Vacavpati Mishra’s ‘Tattva-vaisaradi” are the good additions to Yoga philosophy. These two works are treated as commentaries on Yoga-sutras. \nThe Yoga Philosophy is closely associated with Samkhya philosophy. The Yoga presents a practical path for the realization of the self, whereas the Samkhya emphasizes the attainment of knowledge of self by means of concentration and meditation. Thus, yoga is the practice and Samkhya is its theory. \n\n\nPatanjali’s Yoga-Sutras consist of four parts. These are;\nSamadhi pada (Concentration)\nSadhana pada (Practice)\nVibhuti Pada (Progressing)\nKaivalya pada (Liberation)\n\n#yogasutras #spirituality #patanjali #yogaphilosophy #yoga #secret\n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nScript: Shaiju Koottucheradil Chacko\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Pä, the fourth syllable, helps to achieve perfection of perseverance, Me helps achieve perfection in the practice of concentration, and the final sixth syllable Hum helps achieve perfection in the practice of wisdom.\"\n\nOm Mani Padmei Hum is the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. It first appeared in the Mahayana Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra where it is also referred to as the sadaksara (six syllabled) and the paramahrdaya, or “innermost heart” of Avalokiteshvara. In this text the mantra is seen as the condensed form of all Buddhist teachings.\n\nThe first word Aum/Om is a sacred syllable in various Indian religions, and Hum represents the spirit of enlightenment.[4]\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, this is the most ubiquitous mantra and the most popular form of religious practice, performed by laypersons and monastics alike. It is also an ever present feature of the landscape, commonly carved onto rocks, known as mani stones, painted into the sides of hills or else it is written on prayer flags and prayer wheels.[5]\n\nOriginal Sound: Asangoham Productions | Artist: Drsyaa\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

It was only a matter of time for the belief in God to no longer hold sway in culture and society.\n\nToday’s Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has many software engineers looking at ways in which to overcome the bias expressed in some AI, such as Alexis.\n\nAs we develop Artficial Intellgence it is becoming increasingly important to uncover any bias that may be lurking in the software.\n\n#god #artificialintelligence #nietzsche #schooloflife #pursuitofwonder #spirituality\n\nScript: Matt Mackane\n\nVoiceover: Stephen McNamara\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

During his lifetime, Milarepa established the lineage of the Kagyu sect; however, he is very highly venerated, to this day, by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nToday as we go through this school of life, we shall try to understand how an enlightened person lives. In our pursuit of wonder, we shall borrow knowledge from the following traditions: Buddhism(Zen and Tibetian), Advaita Vedanta, Taoism, Confucianism and other schools of philosophy. \n\nIn the West, the intuition of emptiness (expressed in Western philosophy often as nihilism) is conceived as lack. This inherent sense of lack, according to the scholar David R. Loy, is seen as needing to be overcome or obsessively filled. This explains the West's hyper-consumerism, narcissism, and obsession with things and status. \n\nWe obsessively spend our days in the desperate attempt to fill with consumer goods the void intuited at the centre of existence.\n\nThe East (even though becoming more and more Westernised every day) has traditionally seen emptiness, not as lack, but as pure potentiality. \n\nThat is to say, emptiness is seen as pure allowing. That which allows anything at all to exist.\n\nEmptiness is seen as the generative ground from which anything at all can arise.\n\n#enlightenment #buddhism #confucius #dalailama #zen\n\nThumbnail: Mark Bryan \n\nScript: Matt Mackane\n\nVoiceover: Surjit Singh\n\nMusic: Motion array\n\nDISCLAIMER 01: All ideas expressed on this channel are for entertainment and general information purposes only.

Although Hermes Trismegistus is the author named in the text, its first known appearance is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. \n\nHermes Trismegistus (from Ancient Greek: Ἑρμῆς ὁ Τρισμέγιστος, \"Hermes the Thrice-Greatest\"; Classical Latin: Mercurius ter Maximus) is a legendary Hellenistic figure that originated as a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.[1] He is the purported author of the Hermetica, a widely diverse series of ancient and medieval pseudepigraphical texts that lay the basis of various philosophical systems known as Hermeticism.\n\nThe wisdom attributed to this figure in antiquity combined a knowledge of both the material and the spiritual world, which rendered the writings attributed to him of great relevance to those who were interested in the interrelationship between the material and the divine.[2]\n\nVoiceover: Keoki Trask\n\nMusic: MotionArray\n\nDISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.

Today we shall take a look at his poem \"Unending Love\" which when reflected upon, shall destroy all boundaries.\n\n#rabindranathtagore #quotes #poem #unendinglove #deepquotes #doseofquotes #poetry #spirituality #rabindranathtagorepoem\n\nVisuals By: Instagram: @iancrann\nWebsite: iancrann.com\nTwitter: @ian_crann\nTikTok: @ian_crann\n\nVoiceover: Mike Davison\n\nOriginal Score: Rajat Prasanna\n\nPoem Lyrics(English) :\n\nI seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…\nIn life after life, in age after age, forever.\nMy spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,\nThat you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,\nIn life after life, in age after age, forever.\n\nWhenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,\nIts ancient tale of being apart or together.\nAs I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,\nClad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:\nYou become an image of what is remembered forever.\n\nYou and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.\nAt the heart of time, love of one for another.\nWe have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same\nShy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-\nOld love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.\n\nToday it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you\nThe love of all man’s days both past and forever:\nUniversal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.\nThe memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –\nAnd the songs of every poet past and forever.\n\nPoem Lyrics (Bengali):\nরবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর\nকাব্যগ্রন্থ : মানসী\nতোমারেই যেন ভালোবাসিয়াছি\nশত রূপে শত বার\nজনমে জনমে, যুগে যুগে অনিবার।\nচিরকাল ধরে মুগ্ধ হৃদয়\nগাঁথিয়াছে গীতহার,\nকত রূপ ধরে পরেছ গলায়,\nনিয়েছ সে উপহার\nজনমে জনমে যুগে যুগে অনিবার।\nযত শুনি সেই অতীত কাহিনী,\nপ্রাচীন প্রেমের ব্যথা,\nঅতি পুরাতন বিরহমিলনকথা,\nঅসীম অতীতে চাহিতে চাহিতে\nদেখা দেয় অবশেষে\nকালের তিমিররজনী ভেদিয়া\nতোমারি মুরতি এসে,\nচিরস্মৃতিময়ী ধ্রুবতারকার বেশে।\nআমরা দুজনে ভাসিয়া এসেছি\nযুগল প্রেমের স্রোতে\nঅনাদিকালের হৃদয়-উৎস হতে।\nআমরা দুজনে করিয়াছি খেলা\nকোটি প্রেমিকের মাঝে\nবিরহবিধুর নয়নসলিলে,\nমিলনমধুর লাজে–\nপুরাতন প্রেম নিত্যনূতন সাজে।\nআজি সেই চিরদিবসের প্রেম\nঅবসান লভিয়াছে\nরাশি রাশি হয়ে তোমার পায়ের কাছে।\nনিখিলের সুখ, নিখিলের দুখ,\nনিখিল প্রাণের প্রীতি,\nএকটি প্রেমের মাঝারে মিশেছে\nসকল প্রেমের স্মৃতি–\nসকল কালের সকল কবির গীতি।\n\nDISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.

I asked for their hand in marriage again,\nI begged—I begged to wed every object\nand creature,\n\nand when they accepted,\nGod was ever present in my arms.\nAnd He did not say,\n“Where have you\nbeen?”\n\nFor then I knew my soul—every soul—\nhas always held\nHim.\n\n#meistereckhart #poem #whenIwastheforest #quotes #deepquotes #mysticism #christiantheology #bible\n\nVoiceover: Mike Davison\n\nOriginal Score: Rajat Prasanna\n\nDISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
