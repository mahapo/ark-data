time."},{"startMs":191160,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"The chair almost looked unfamiliar to him as he continued looking at it."},{"startMs":194500,"durationMs":1660,"subtitle":"He thought about how

up."},{"startMs":205920,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"Another day, he realized he was on this planet, and the planet showed up."},{"startMs":209040,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"And this continued on

anything."},{"startMs":225280,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"If with no one to sit, there would be no chairs, then what would there be with no one to

everything."},{"startMs":261000,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"That here in this restaurant, he was creating existence as he lived through
