Camus"},{"startMs":244940,"durationMs":8120,"subtitle":"In other words, neither the human nor the universe are necessarily absurd on their own but rather the relantionship is absurd"},{"startMs":253180,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"As humans, we exist with an innate desire for meaning, reason and order"},{"startMs":257880,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"Yet we simultaneously

experience"},{"startMs":367420,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"However, also in this comparison, Camus writes \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\""},{"startMs":373080,"durationMs":8140,"subtitle":"With this, Camus poses the hopeful yet reasonable assertion that even in the ordinary, repetitive and likely futile experience of our everyday life"},{"startMs":381220,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"We can and should still find worthy experience and happiness"},{"startMs":385120,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"For Camus, there are plenty of tremendous reasons to endure the potential absurdity and pointlessness of rolling the rock up and down the hill"},{"startMs":392520,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"All of the things that existed around the rock that tend to seem as though they are less important than getting the rock to the top of the hill"},{"startMs":399100,"durationMs":6920,"subtitle":"The sun, the trees, the refreshing breeze, the friends, the relationships, the family, the art,

Why?"},{"startMs":435220,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"We desperate try to find the answers, we get increasingly clever in our attempts."},{"startMs":439680,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"Yet every answer, just like that of the rock in the myth of Sisyphus, at some point returns to the bottom of the hill"},{"startMs":446220,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"leaving us to start again"},{"startMs":448460,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"As a result of this constant inability to satiate our desire for ultimate meaning and truth"},{"startMs":453720,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"We can often find ourselves judging over the seeming absurdity and futility of it all"},{"startMs":458200,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"However, Camus felt that even in the conflict of absurdity, we can be okay and still live happy lives"},{"startMs":464280,"durationMs":2220,"subtitle":"So long as we accept the absurdity"},{"startMs":466640,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"In the acceptance of our absurd human experience, we realize that the point is not to eliminate absurdity"},{"startMs":472340,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"or find in defense some ultimate truth"},{"startMs":474420,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"But rather, It is to be conscious and appreciative of the things within the absurdity"},{"startMs":478820,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"to look for, find and create things that are interesting and personally meaningful"},{"startMs":483560,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"Furthermore, Camus suggested that in the recognizing of our absurdity, we can better accept and share value with the people around us"},{"startMs":490580,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"Because we understand that we are all struggling victims of this absurd life"},{"startMs":495220,"durationMs":7540,"subtitle":"For Camus, continuing on in life and using its absurdity as a means of virtue. exploration, art and unique experience"},{"startMs":502760,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"It is perhaps the highest and most worthy achievement in human life"},{"startMs":506200,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"When referencing the predicament of Sisyphus' fate, Camus writes"},{"startMs":510020,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"\"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a mans heart.\""},{"startMs":516420,"durationMs":1060,"subtitle":"Transcription made by Christian Aranguiz"}]
