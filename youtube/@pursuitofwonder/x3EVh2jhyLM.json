everything."},{"startMs":7000,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"Our identities, our beliefs, our friendships and families, our societies, and so on"},{"startMs":12000,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"Stories have a way of not only entertaining, but training us."},{"startMs":15260,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"They can be incredibly powerful and beautiful devices that form and assist"},{"startMs":18620,"durationMs":2100,"subtitle":"our perception and understanding of the world."},{"startMs":21080,"durationMs":3435,"subtitle":"However, according to twentieth century American author Kurt Vonnegut"},{"startMs":24515,"durationMs":2430,"subtitle":"Stories rarely tell the truth."},{"startMs":26945,"durationMs":2915,"subtitle":"After studying stories from an anthropological standpoint,"},{"startMs":29860,"durationMs":2220,"subtitle":"examining their relationships with various cultures,"},{"startMs":32120,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"Vonnegut found that stories and myths across many cultures"},{"startMs":35140,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"share consistent similar shapes that can typically be broken down into just a few main categories"},{"startMs":40200,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"These shapes can be found by graphing the course of a protagonist's journey through a story"},{"startMs":44105,"durationMs":3050,"subtitle":"along an axis of good and ill fortune."},{"startMs":47155,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"In all stories someone or something starts somewhere"},{"startMs":50360,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"Either in a good place, bad place, or neutral place."},{"startMs":53200,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"Then things happen related to that person which are conveyed as good or bad"},{"startMs":57020,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"bringing the character up and down the axis of fortune as they traverse forward through the story."},{"startMs":61640,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"Then, the story ends and its shape reveals itself"},{"startMs":64620,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"Vonnegut discovered that many popular stories follow common, consistent curves and spikes up and down the good/ill fortune axis"},{"startMs":71020,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and that most end with the protagonist higher on the axis than where they started."},{"startMs":74620,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"However, what's perhaps most interesting about Vonnegut's analysis"},{"startMs":77700,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"is his argument that these shapes, and consequently most stories, lie."},{"startMs":82280,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"Vonnegut proposed that a more honest, realistic story shape is simply a straight line."},{"startMs":87240,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"In a story of this shape, things still happen and characters still change"},{"startMs":91180,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"but the story maintains ambiguity around whether or not the events that occur are conclusively good or bad."},{"startMs":96940,"durationMs":5540,"subtitle":"One example of a story that Vonnegut references with this straight line shape is Shakespeare's play Hamlet"},{"startMs":102480,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"A play that has and continues to be regarded by many as one of the best and most famous plays,"},{"startMs":107100,"durationMs":1940,"subtitle":"and perhaps literary works in general,"},{"startMs":109040,"durationMs":1540,"subtitle":"of all time"},{"startMs":110640,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"In which the story moves forward and things happen but none of the events are conclusively good or bad"},{"startMs":115560,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"and thus the audience is left unaware as to what is."},{"startMs":118520,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"Which, according to Vonnegut, is the closest literary representation of real life"},{"startMs":123220,"durationMs":2300,"subtitle":"We are so seldom told the truth"},{"startMs":125540,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"In Hamlet - in Hamlet, Shakespeare tells us"},{"startMs":131240,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"We don't know enough about life to know"},{"startMs":134200,"durationMs":3135,"subtitle":"what the good news is and the bad news is"},{"startMs":137340,"durationMs":1380,"subtitle":"and we respond to that"},{"startMs":139280,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"One story medium that seems to inadvertently coincide with this idea"},{"startMs":142420,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"is the medium of the television series"},{"startMs":145160,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"The goal of a TV series is to keep viewers watching as long as possible."},{"startMs":148580,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"Each episode must be an engaging enough story to keep the viewer watching until the end"},{"startMs":152840,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"but each episode must also be left unresolved enough"},{"startMs":155500,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so the larger season-long and series-long stories continue"},{"startMs":158380,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"and the viewer is interested in watching all the following episodes."},{"startMs":161280,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"If enough people watch all the episodes in a season"},{"startMs":163900,"durationMs":1740,"subtitle":"the show gets renewed for more seasons"},{"startMs":165640,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"and the cycle continues for as many seasons as possible."},{"startMs":168560,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"In order to keep the whole thing going, none of the stories can reach a conclusion"},{"startMs":171780,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"and thus, the main characters can't find ultimate peace or freedom from the uncertainty between good and ill fortune."},{"startMs":177860,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"Of course, most shows don't qualify as the straight line shape in Vonnegut's analysis"},{"startMs":181880,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"because most shows attempt to convey conclusively good and bad fortunes within them."},{"startMs":185920,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"However, merely by the requirements of the medium"},{"startMs":188900,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"TV series are forced to self-impose the same sort of universal truth that Vonnegut suggests."},{"startMs":193620,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"That neither the viewer nor the characters in a series"},{"startMs":195880,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"can ever know what anything that's so called 'good' or 'bad' in one episode"},{"startMs":199360,"durationMs":1380,"subtitle":"might cause in the next."},{"startMs":200740,"durationMs":1660,"subtitle":"And that on a fundamental level"},{"startMs":202400,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the changes in each episode are futile because they are a part of a never-ending cycle of change"},{"startMs":207200,"durationMs":1580,"subtitle":"through conflict and resolution"},{"startMs":208780,"durationMs":2020,"subtitle":"for the mere sake of its continuation"},{"startMs":210800,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"with no aim of final resolution or reveal of what's ultimately good or bad."},{"startMs":215220,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"Of course, eventually a show reaches its series end"},{"startMs":217900,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"when it stops working or runs its natural course."},{"startMs":220360,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"But the show fights its whole life to stay away from this moment."},{"startMs":223180,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"A good TV series, a series that we don't want to end,"},{"startMs":226080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"is only a series that we don't want to end because it can't seem to resolve itself."},{"startMs":230080,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"In this, the format of a TV series also shows us that there is meaning,"},{"startMs":234240,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"engagement, and entertainment within the endless cycle of change"},{"startMs":237160,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"regardless of its potential universal futility."},{"startMs":240360,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And that perhaps change in life can exist"},{"startMs":242360,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"not for the sake of some conclusion or ultimate state of peace"},{"startMs":245420,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"but a continuation of itself for the sake of itself."},{"startMs":248040,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"A continual adaptation and movement in life, so to keep life alive and interesting."},{"startMs":252780,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"And perhaps the ability to be in this cycle of continued change for the sake of change"},{"startMs":256820,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"is the actual good fortune."},{"startMs":258440,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"Renowned twentieth century mythologist, writer, and professor of literature Joseph Campbell said:"},{"startMs":263220,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"What I think is that a good life is one hero journey after

aspects of life."},{"startMs":284800,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"They help us better connect and share ideas, lessons, and meaning."},{"startMs":288520,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"They are a beautiful, essential device of conscious life."},{"startMs":291060,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And stories don't always have to be real or accurately representative of life"},{"startMs":294580,"durationMs":1740,"subtitle":"to be helpful and important."},{"startMs":296340,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"But the truth is we appear to so often see life the same way that our favorite stories do."},{"startMs":301040,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"It is no coincidence that most good stories share the same basic structure, ingredients, and shapes."},{"startMs":305860,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"They're a reflection of how we often like to think"},{"startMs":308060,"durationMs":2020,"subtitle":"and how we often want the world to be."},{"startMs":310080,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"However, when we assume that our entire life can fit neatly into the templates of our favorite
