Through compelling stories and metaphors, Andreotti delves into the deep influence of modernity on human thought, behavior, relationships, fears, and desires. She invites readers to provide palliative care to a dying modernity while simultaneously offering prenatal care for the emergence of a new and yet-to-be-defined future that holds the potential for greater wisdom and responsibility.\n\n\nVanessa Machado de Oliveira Andreotti is an internationally celebrated Latinx educator and the new Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of Victoria. She is a former Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities and Global Change and the former David Lam Chair in Multicultural Education. Vanessa‚Äôs research problematizes approaches to education and global change that reproduce paternalistic forms of relationships; simplistic solutions to complex problems; and ethnocentric ideals of sustainability, equity, justice, and change. Vanessa is the author of Hospicing Modernity and one of the co-founders of the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures Collective, which promotes the practice of depth/probiotic education.\n\nGiovanna de Oliveira Andreotti is a recent graduate in psychology, a dancer and a dedicated dance instructor. Through involuntary inherited biological circumstances (aka being Vanessa‚Äôs daughter), she has been a life-long (un)willing test subject and insightful critic of depth/probiotic education, having an invaluable perspective on its risks, generative potential and impact. Giovanna's insights stem from her deep immersion in the zeitgeist of GenZ. As a representative of this generation, she critically embodies their collective aspirations, concerns, frustrations and resilience in the face of a future that feels compromised and stolen.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

One was her Community Conversation with Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo the second a story she read called ‚ÄúHealing: A Ghost Story‚Äù with Bayo Akomolafe.\n\nSophie‚Äôs course ‚ÄúThe Body is a Doorway‚Äù at SAND ‚Äì https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/the-body-is-a-doorway\n\nSophie Strand is a writer based in the Hudson Valley who focuses on the intersection of spirituality, storytelling, and ecology. But it would probably be more authentic to call her a neo-troubadour animist with a propensity to spin yarns that inevitably turn into love stories. Give her a salamander and a stone and she‚Äôll write you a love story. Sophie was raised by house cats, puff balls, possums, raccoons, and an opinionated, crippled goose. In every neighborhood she‚Äôs ever lived in she has been known as ‚Äúthe walker‚Äù. She believes strongly that all thinking happens interstitially ‚Äì between beings, ideas, differences, mythical gradients.\n\nHer first book of essays The Flowering Wand: Lunar Kings, Lichenized Lovers, Transpecies Magicians, and Rhizomatic Harpists Heal the Masculine is available now from Inner Traditions. Her eco-feminist historical fiction reimagining of the gospels The Madonna Secret will also be published by Inner Traditions. Her books of poetry include Love Song to a Blue God (Oread Press) and Those Other Flowers to Come (Dancing Girl Press) and The Approach (The Swan).

Through compelling stories and metaphors, Andreotti delves into the deep influence of modernity on human thought, behavior, relationships, fears, and desires. She invites readers to provide palliative care to a dying modernity while simultaneously offering prenatal care for the emergence of a new and yet-to-be-defined future that holds the potential for greater wisdom and responsibility.\n\nIn this webinar series, Vanessa, 47, and her daughter Giovanna, 23, embark on a cross-generational conversation that sets the stage for an exploration of the decline of modernity and the monumental challenges and possibilities that lie ahead of us. Together, they candidly discuss the complexities of confronting humanity's wrongs and our shared complicity in perpetuating harm. They emphasize the importance of facing our shadows, metaphorically and literally composting our \"shit,\" navigating tightropes, and moving with storms together.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to engage in what Vanessa terms \"probiotic education\" ‚Äî an education that supports our collective digestion of the challenging circumstances unfolding within and around us. Rather than prescribing fixed beliefs or solutions, the webinar offers tools that strengthen our intellectual, affective, and relational capacities, equipping us to confront the complexities of multiple realities. It encourages us to learn from past and ongoing collective mistakes in order to make only new mistakes in the future, and to show up differently for the planet. Vanessa and Giovanna kindly request that participants temporarily set aside their conditioned desires for easy hope, quick solutions, clear-cut answers and simplistic visions of the future. Instead, they invite us to sit with the magnitude of the challenges we face, both within and around us, without turning away, throwing tantrums, drowning in the pain of it all or giving up.\n\nSaturdays/Sundays, August 5‚Äì6 & 12‚Äì13, 2023\n10am‚Äì12pm PDT\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Mauro Zappaterra shares cutting-edge insights about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ‚Äî a clear fluid that bathes our entire central nervous (CNS) system. Our CNS is entirely buoyant in this fluid, which is 99% water. Water has been shown to exhibit much more complex properties than we used to think. Could water hold memory or transmit energy? And therefore could the CSF be a conduit or bridge from physical form to Source energy and consciousness?\n\nMauro Zappaterra obtained his MD and PhD from Harvard Medical School. He is board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a focus on optimizing human performance, increasing awareness and decreasing suffering. He has been practicing mindfulness since 1998, and teaching mindfulness to patients with chronic pain since 2018, as he is the Director of Multidisciplinary Care at Synovation Medical Group.  He has led the Awakening Awareness Program for the Emerging Sciences Foundation which can be found on YouTube.  He has published numerous scientific papers and medical book chapters on the cerebrospinal fluid, disability, and pain management. He has also published \"I Am\", \"All One\", and \"All Love\" which are three books exploring topics of awareness, primarily for kids, but really for people of all ages.  He has also published \"Close Your Eyes, What Do You See?\" with his son, which is a story about imagination and intention.  He continues to create programs to help patients with chronic pain and investigate the cerebrospinal fluid and integrate new research to evolve the hypothesis of The Cerebrospinal fluid and I Am. \n\nhttps://www.holdingspace.com/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Hofstadter, G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach\n\nDonald Hoffman is a cognitive scientist and author of more than 100 scientific papers and three books, including  Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See  (W.W. Norton, 2000). He received his BA from UCLA in Quantitative Psychology and his Ph.D. from MIT in Computational Psychology. He joined the faculty of UC Irvine in 1983, where he is now a full professor in the departments of cognitive science, computer science and philosophy. He received a Distinguished Scientific Award of the American Psychological Association for early career research into visual perception, the Rustum Roy Award of the Chopra Foundation, and the Troland Research Award of the US National Academy of Sciences. He was chosen by students at UC Irvine to receive a campus-wide teaching award, and to be included in Who‚Äôs Who Among America‚Äôs Teachers.\n\nHoffman studies visual perception, visual attention and consciousness using mathematical models, computer simulations, and psychological experiments. His empirical research has led to new insights into how we perceive objects, colors and motion. His theoretical research has led to a ‚Äúuser interface‚Äù theory of perception, which proposes that natural selection shapes our perceptions not to report truth but simply to guide adaptive behavior; this is the subject of his TED Talk entitled ‚Äú Do we see reality as it is ?‚Äù and of an article in The Atlantic entitled ‚Äú The case against reality .‚Äù  It has also led to a ‚Äú conscious realism ‚Äù theory of consciousness‚Äîwhich proposes a formal model of consciousness and a new solution to the mind-body problem.\n\nRupert Spira lives in the UK and holds regular meetings and retreats in Europe and the U.S. In these meetings he explores the perennial non-dual understanding that lies at the heart of all the great religious and spiritual traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, Hinduism, Buddhism, mystical Christianity, Sufism and Zen, and which is also the direct, ever-present reality of our own experience. It is a contemporary, experiential approach involving silent meditation, guided meditation and conversation, and it requires no affiliation to any particular religious or spiritual tradition. All that is needed is an interest in the essential nature of experience, and in the longing for love, peace and happiness around which most of our lives revolve.\nRupert is author of The Transparency of Things ‚Äì Contemplating the Nature of Experience (2008); Presence, in two volumes: The Art of Peace and Happiness and The Intimacy of All Experience (2012); The Light of Pure Knowing ‚Äì Thirty Meditations on the Essence of Non-Duality (2014); The Ashes of Love (2016); and Transparent Body, Luminous World ‚Äì The Tantric Yoga of Sensation and Perception (2017). Forthcoming titles include The Nature of Consciousness ‚Äì Essays on the Unity of Mind and Matter (2017) and The Essence of Meditation ‚Äì Being Aware of Being Aware (2017).\n\nhttps://rupertspira.com/\n\nTopics:\n00:00:00 ‚Äì Introduction\n00:03:30 ‚Äì What‚Äôs at the Your Current Edge?\n00:10:35 ‚Äì Is the Mind the Right Instrument for Exploring Consciousness?\n00:18:52 ‚Äì Resting in the Unknown and What Is Understanding, The Ultimate Science?\n00:26:44 ‚Äì What Does the Ego Want?\n00:37:00 ‚Äì Why Does the One Let Itself Go Unconscious?\n00:52:00 ‚Äì What Are The Limits of Language and Thoughts to Express Consciousness?\n00:56:56 ‚Äì The Amplitudhedron and Beyond\n01:02:00 ‚Äì How Can We Perceive Outside of Spacetime?\n01:16:39 ‚Äì Spiritual Bypassing: Awakening and Transcending\n\nPrevious Episode with Simon Mundie: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality | Donald Hoffman & Rupert Spira\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafVevceWgs\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Her background includes Buddhism, Advaita, nontraditional meditative inquiry, radical nonduality, martial arts, somatic work, addiction recovery, political activism, visual arts, and a devotion to both boundless presence and the beauty of the ordinary. Joan has held public and private meetings as well as occasional workshops and retreats since 1996. Her bare-bones approach is open, direct, down-to-earth, and rooted in the ever-fresh aliveness here and now. She encourages people to question the stories, beliefs and misunderstandings that create so much of our human suffering and confusion, especially our tendency to mistake conceptual maps for the living actuality. Rather than relying on outside authorities, traditional ideas, acquired knowledge or beliefs, this is about the immediacy of present experiencing, just as it is. Joan has been with many different teachers and non-teachers and was especially close with Toni Packer, a former Zen teacher who left that tradition behind to work in a simpler and more open way, but Joan does not identify with or represent any particular tradition or way of working. Joan describes her writings and meetings with people as explorations, \"like a child exploring its toes or a lover exploring the beloved,\" and she adds, \"There is no end to such explorations, all of which are forms of play.\" Joan is the author of Bare-Bones Meditation: Waking Up from the Story of My Life (1996), Awake in the Heartland: The Ecstasy of What Is (2003), Painting the Sidewalk with Water: Talks and Dialogs about Nonduality (2010), Nothing to Grasp (2012), and Death: The End of Self-Improvement (2019).

It shapes the way we live, the way we love and the way we make sense of the world. It is at the root of our deepest wounds. Virtually all our afflictions, mental illnesses, physical diseases stem from trauma. Trauma distorts our view of reality and leaves us stuck in contraction, defense and reactivity. It compromises our capacity to be in the moment, to be present to our relationships and to fully take in the environment.\n\nThe wisdom in the trauma comes through when we realize that our traumatic responses and imprints are not us, that we can follow all traumatic responses back to their source, work through them, let them dissipate and thus reconnect to the unblemished, ecstatic consciousness that we were born with.\n\nJoin Dr. Gabor Mat√© for this 4-day participatory, interactive online workshop on understanding and healing trauma. Gabor will share decades of research and experience. He will guide us to discover the root cause of our trauma. We will begin building a relationship with it, so we can start to uncover the wisdom and reconnect to our true selves beneath the hurts and adaptations.  The workshop will include daily talks and interactive engagements with and among participants. We will learn some of the tools offered by Gabor‚Äôs Compassionate Inquiry‚Ñ¢ approach. We will also be gently guided daily by Betsy Polatin in breath and movement, including Somatic Experiencing practices and resolution of trauma in the body. This combination invites pain, discomfort and repressed emotions to come to the surface to be experienced, witnessed and let go of in a safe, supportive setting. Acceptance, allowing, non-judgement, expression and self-compassion are the ingredients needed for healing.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

The two talks are entitled ‚ÄúChristianity and Unknowing‚Äù from SAND16 and ‚ÄúThe Christian Meaning Of Enlightenment‚Äù from SAND11. Richard Rohr, as a Catholic priest and Franciscan Friar, offers a concise history of how Western Christianity once had, soon lost, tried to retrieve, and now is roundly rediscovering its own traditional understanding of unitive consciousness (which was our word for non-dual thinking). \n\nThe Christian contemplative mind was usually a subtext, and yet it was always clearly there too, and much closer to the surface, but only for those exposed to the mystical base that was revealed in the Gospel of John, the Desert Fathers and Mothers, the Celtic and monastic traditions, and what was generally referred to as the apophatic or wisdom stream of Christianity. These were our many saints and mystics. This possibility was brought to the fore by Thomas Merton in the middle of the last century, and is now flowing in many positive directions. \n\nIt is now our task to rediscover the pre-Enlightenment Christianity that reveled in \"the cloud of unknowing\", what some called \"learned ignorance\", and the very notion of Mystery itself. Only when we got into competition with rationalism and secularism, did we adopt this rather recent mania for certitude and a very limited kind of scientific knowing. \n\nAlmost the entire history of Protestantism emerged in this period, and thus the contemplative mind is an utterly new revelation for them, and frankly for all of us, as we again learn to be comfortable living on the edge of both the knowable and the unknown.\n\nFr. Richard Rohr is a globally recognized ecumenical teacher bearing witness to the universal awakening within Christian mysticism and the Perennial Tradition. He is a Franciscan priest of the New Mexico Province and founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fr. Richard‚Äôs teaching is grounded in the Franciscan alternative orthodoxy‚Äîpractices of contemplation and self-emptying, expressing itself in radical compassion, particularly for the socially marginalized. Fr. Richard is the author of numerous books, including Everything Belongs, Adam‚Äôs Return, The Naked Now, Breathing Under Water, Falling Upward, Immortal Diamond, and Eager to Love: The Alternative Way of Francis of Assisi.\n\nhttps://cac.org/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Each child born invites us to turn in the direction of a new way, a new world balance, so close and yet seemingly so far‚Ä¶ What will it take to remember?\n\nAll living beings enter life with a blueprint for unfolding and growing toward maximum becoming and actualization. To do so requires a set of circumstances, a response from the receiving environment that answers these innate instructions. In nature, we can observe the unfolding of a spider, a bird, a fox, or an oak tree according to their design. No external instructions are provided, patterns are inborn and carried forth, generation after generation. Barring any interruption, the young will be delivered into an environment which will provide for optimal growth through all stages of life into fruition and actualization.\n\nHuman Actualization is the full becoming of our species‚Äô universal as well as unique individual qualities, living at the core of each one of us. Actualization assures a grounded and open being, prepared to fully meet the world according to the native design of the species, within its ecological niche, in the larger circle of life.\n\nIt has been said that the only species that forgets its ‚Äúoriginal instructions‚Äù, as many indigenous cultures name this inborn blueprint, is humankind. We can remember, though, by bringing our humble attention and deepening gratitude to many indigenous cultures on the planet that always have carried and celebrated this knowledge, and still do, at an impossibly high cost to themselves as they continue to hold the medicine bundle of the species, the sacred knowledge of the web of life that must not be sacrificed. We will be helped to remember by witnessing the universal song of beauty that still sings through the clouds of trauma and loss, theirs as well as our own.\n\nFor a balanced future to come into existence on Earth, we would be well inspired to follow these instructions as parents, teachers, healers, extended families and extended human communities.\n\nWe will explore, among others:\n\n‚ñ∫  The human blueprint\n‚ñ∫  The meaning of call and response\n‚ñ∫  Indigenous ways of knowing\n‚ñ∫  Injury to the design and patterns of defense ‚Äî body, mind, emotions, and spirit\n‚ñ∫  The healing journey ‚Äî heroic journey for all time\n\nAttaining balance in the ever-growing circles that surround each birth is in our hands. Let‚Äôs begin here together!\n\nThis is our human journey. We will explore it together, welcoming an openness to our own individual experiencing, inviting participation, stories and questions. Together we learn and with deep compassion, we will remember.\n\nSundays April 16, 23, 30, & May 7, 2023\n10‚Äì11:30am PDT\n\n‚û°Ô∏è  Register here: https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/natures-blueprint\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Her work as a therapist and teacher invites people to shed attachment to false identities, return to their essential wholeness, and realize the truth of who they are. In primarily group courses, she holds safe space for people to investigate patterns of early trauma that live in the mind, body, and heart‚Äîand are carried through family generations. And she welcomes celebration of the freedom that‚Äôs discovered when the attachment to these patterns falls away and there‚Äôs space for awakened living in everyday life. Her teaching is practical and accessible to all. She loves meeting with people who have tried everything and are still searching for an end to suffering.\n\nGail received her B.A. from Carnegie-Mellon University and Ph.D. from Temple University. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Florida and a clinical internship at the Veteran‚Äôs Administration Hospital in Palo Alto, CA.

As a member of the clinical faculty at University of California, San Francisco, she helped physicians develop communication skills and learn to address psychosocial issues with their patients. She has authored numerous published articles on coping with stress and chronic medical illness. And, for 15 years, she consulted with staff of assisted living and skilled nursing facilities about aging, dementia, and caregiving and gave presentations to the community at large on these topics.\n\nGail is the author of three books: The End of Self-Help: Discovering Peace and Happiness Right at the Heart of Your Messy, Scary, Brilliant Life, At the Core of Every Heart: Reflections, Insights, and Practices for Waking Up and Living Free, and Suffering Is Optional: A Spiritual Guide to Freedom from Self-Judgment and Feelings of Inadequacy.\n\nAs a blogger, she has been featured on CNN, Huffington Post, Zen Habits, MindBodyGreen, Tiny Buddha, Inspire Me Today, and the Undivided Journal.

Our world is going through challenges, upheaval, and confusion. Some see this moment as an evolutionary threshold. Death feels closer. False beliefs, obsolete structures, and ideas of separateness are falling away. This crisis has forced us to perceive life on a planetary scale.

The four-part series is offered on our website:\nhttps://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/the-art-of-letting-go\n\nPeter Russell explains how treating letting go as ‚Äúletting in‚Äù and ‚Äúletting be‚Äù leads to a much easier approach than the conventional trying to let go we usually default to. He will show how to apply this approach to letting go of judgments and grievances, fears and attachments, unhealthy emotions and fixed beliefs, our ego, and our suffering, thence opening to the peace, joy, and love that are our true nature.\n\nIn March 2023 join Peter for a brand-new series 'Enjoying Meditation\nHow to have meditation be a delight rather than a chore'.\nhttps://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/enjoying-meditation\n\nDoes it surprise you to hear that meditation can be enjoyable? Perhaps you‚Äôve been discouraged because it seems takes a lot of effort and discipline? Or find it a chore, a never-ending struggle to quiet the mind and focus the attention?\n\nPeter Russell shows how meditation not only can be enjoyable, but should be so. From a lifetime of teaching meditation, he‚Äôs developed ways to help the mind to settle down easily and quickly. The key is to give up all trying and effort. When we do, we find meditation can be something we delight in and look forward to.\n\nPeter takes a straightforward approach to meditation that encourages the mind to relax. As it begins to settle down, we find ourselves more in the present moment, not caught up in distracting thoughts and emotional reactions. We feel more content and at ease. And the more we slow down, the more aware we become of an ever-present inner quietness. We can begin to savor the stillness of our own Being, our authentic self.\n\nThe course will take you from the basic practice of meditation to some of the more advanced techniques that Peter has been teaching in recent years. We will also learn how to bring the ease, joy, and clarity of mind that we experience in meditation back into our daily lives.\n\nTopics will include:\n\n    ‚ÄìAllowing the mind to fully relax\n    ‚ÄìManaging thoughts in meditation\n    ‚ÄìNew approaches to letting go\n    ‚ÄìDissolving the ego-mind\n    ‚ÄìOpening to the heart\n    ‚ÄìSavoring the stillness of Being\n    ‚ÄìLoving your true Self\n\nThese webinars will also be an opportunity to discuss with Peter his work on consciousness and the nature of spiritual awakening, and how to put into practice the ideas in his recent book, Letting Go of Nothing: Relax Your Mind and Discover the Wonder of Your True Nature.\n\nEach session will start with a talk and a guided meditation, followed by Q&A and group discussion. They will be suitable for both beginners and experienced meditators.\n\nJoin Peter Russell for this live 4-part webinar series!\n\nhttps://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/enjoying-meditation\n\nOriginally studying mathematics and theoretical physics, Peter Russell became increasingly interested in the nature of consciousness, and in the late sixties traveled to India, to study meditation and Eastern philosophy. On his return he established a meditation center in Cambridge, England, and went on to pioneer the introduction of personal growth programs to corporations. He is the author of a dozen books, including The Global Brain, Waking Up In Time, and From Science to God, and Seeds of Awakening. At SAND conferences he has led morning meditation sessions that people have found very helpful\n\nhttps://peterrussell.com\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Historical trauma is trauma so deeply rooted in the subconscious we may not even know it is there. It can leave us feeling anxious, irritable, sad, and hopeless‚Ä¶ and we have no idea why. But once we begin to see the larger context of our trauma, then a more holistic healing can begin.\n\nIya Affo is a Culturalist and Historical Trauma consultant. She earned Western certification as a Trauma Specialist and is a descendant of a long line of traditional healers from B√©nin, West Africa. Iya serves as an Executive Board Member for the Arizona ACEs Consortium, is an Adjunct Faculty member at the Arizona Trauma Institute, and is the founder of Heal Historical Trauma Culture & Indigenous Wellness Academy. She has visited more than 30 countries; living in Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist, Native American, and Yoruba communities, embracing aspects from each culture for personal evolution. \n\nShe strives to transcend tolerance through cultivating love and respect in hopes of facilitating the decolonization and subsequent healing of indigenous people from all over the world. Iya advocates for the harmonization of Traditional Medicine and Western Medicine for true holistic healing.\n\nIya's passion is to cultivate intergenerational healing by connecting intuitive ancestral practices with modern neurobiology. As we delve into leveraging our neurobiology to facilitate the healing process, we will also explore re-culturing and the creation of self-harmonizing communities. \nThe full Community Conversation can be viewed here: \n\nhttps://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/a-hunger-for-wholeness","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPdcUCy4agE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPdcUCy4agE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPdcUCy4agE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPdcUCy4agE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPdcUCy4agE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":80,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nPdcUCy4agE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qKEx0sFOILTFZqEi7eVeYILjn0Y","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmhFcVRWNTRFQXYw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-02T16:26:47Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"#20 Vibrating with Awe: Laura Inserra","description":"Sounds of SAND is a podcast from Science and Nonduality which contemplates and reveres the beauty, complexity, pain, and great mystery that weave the infinite cycles of existence.\n\nWe explore beyond ultimate truths, binary thinking, and individual awakening while acknowledging humanity as a mere part of the intricate web of life.\n\nEpisodes tap into SAND‚Äôs rich history and collaborative future by presenting talks, dialogs, interviews, readings, music, and recordings from SAND Conferences, events, and webinars weaving timeless wisdom and embodied experience.\n\nhttps://scienceandnonduality.com/podcast\n\nüéß Subscribe on Apple Podcast, Spotify, and more: http://pod.link/soundsofsand\n\n\"The essence of the Universe is vibration,\nquenchless energy in motion, e-motion.\nMy work is about experiencing the Source and its manifestation\nthrough sound, emotions, and body awareness.\" \n~Laura Inserra\n\nLaura Inserra is a sound alchemist, a technician of the sacred, and a multimedia producer.

One being's lack is not so much a disability as it is an invitation to corporally collaborate with another species. Resilient ecosystems and species emerge from places of physical overlap. In a culture that prizes the individual, what health and resilience have we denied ourselves? Is it possible that there are better futures visible only from the vantage point of symbiotic collaboration? Symbiosis is always fraught. You leave behind a recognizable shape. But, in a moment of extinction and climate collapse, we need to escape the shipwreck of the singular. I want to offer that becoming new is never safe. Survival is never safe. It is always a breach. A break in the skin. It is a leap across the abyss. It is the moment you leap into another body. \n\nIn this excerpt from the SAND Community Gathering hosted by Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo entitled \"We Must Risk New Shapes\", Sophie reads an essay on the topic.

Almaas, founder of the Diamond Approach to Self-realization and Thomas H√ºbl, founder of the Academy of Inner Science.\n\nThis conversation was recorded in as a 2022 SAND Community Gathering facilitated by SAND co-founders Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo.\n\nIn this meeting between two leading contemporary spiritual teachers they explored:\n-Healing the gap between the mind and the heart\n-The path from fragmentation to integration\n-Tapping into our sensing/body intelligence\n-Our potential for healing/realization\n\nIn today‚Äôs world of fast-food spirituality, we can get caught in the illusion of finding a spiritual ‚Äòfix‚Äô for the challenges of life. In this conversation, we will look at the notion of integrated spirituality, and how effective spiritual practice needs time and space to be deeply nourishing, healing and sustainable. Join us to explore what it means to commit to a spiritual path and to live with an awakened heart.\n\nHameed Ali (A. H. Almaas), Founder of the Diamond Approach, was born in the Middle East, but at age 18 he moved to the USA to study at the University of California in Berkeley. Hameed was working on his Ph.D. in physics, where he was studying Einstein's theory of general relativity and nuclear physics, when he reached a turning point in his life and destiny that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. Hameed is the founder of the Diamond Approach¬Æ‚Äîa spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Freedom is living our realization, a dynamic enlightenment where our transcendent nondual truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization. Almaas' books include: Love Unveiled, Unfolding Now, and The Keys to the Enneagram.\n\nhttp://www.diamondapproach.org/almaas\n\nThomas H√ºbl is a renowned teacher, author, and international facilitator whose lifelong work integrates the core insights of the great wisdom traditions and mysticism with the discoveries of science. Since the early 2000s, he has been leading large-scale events and courses that focus on the healing and integration of trauma, with a special focus on the shared history of Israelis and Germans. Over the last decade, he has facilitated dialogue with thousands of people around healing the collective traumas of racism, oppression, colonialism, genocides in the U.S., Israel, Germany, Spain, and Argentina. He has been teaching workshops and presenting trainings for Harvard Medical School since 2019. His non-profit organization, the Pocket Project, works to support the healing of collective trauma throughout the world. He is the author of the book, Healing Collective Trauma: A Process for Integrating Our Intergenerational and Cultural Wounds, which outlines his methodology called the ‚ÄúCollective Trauma Integration Process‚Äù as a safe framework for guiding groups through collective trauma.\n\nhttp://www.collectivetraumabook.com and http://www.thomashuebl.com\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

At the urging of his students, and on the basis of his ancestral Sufi tradition and four-fold training and authorization at the hands of Sayyid Abu Hashim Madani (d. 1907) of Hyderabad, he established an order of Sufism (the Sufi Order) in London in 1914. By the time of his death in 1927, centers had been established throughout Europe and North America, and multiple volumes of his teachings had been published.\n\nMichael Harrison (called \"an American maverick\" by Philip Glass) forges a new approach to composition through just intonation (the system of tuning based on pure harmonic proportions). His works blend classical music traditions of Europe and North India. He is a Guggenheim Fellowship and NYFA Artist Fellowship recipient.\n\nMichael creates dedicated tuning systems for many of his works. He pioneered a structural approach to composition in which the proportions of harmonic relationships organically determine other musical elements such as pitch, duration, and dynamics.

To attend this course, he left his job as a Marketing Manager for the Hewlett-Packard Company and moved his entire family to live in Piercy. Pujya Swamiji asked Sri Kapoor to be the Secretary for the Arsha Vidya Pitham at its inception, and he is still serving in that capacity today.\n\nAfter his graduation from the Piercy course in 1982, Sri Kapoor resumed his work at HP, and also started teaching Vedanta in the San Francisco Bay Area. He took early retirement in the year 2000 to devote his time to the study and teaching of Vedanta and Sanskrit. Sri Kapoor established the Arsha Vidya Center (AVC), whose goal is to promote Pujya Swamiji's teachings in the local area. Toward that goal, both Swami Viditatmananda and Swami Tattvavidananda have been visiting the Bay Area regularly for talks, classes and retreats. Sri Kapoor currently teaches two Vedanta classes per week to about 50 students, two Sanskrit classes per week and has established four Gita Home Study groups in the area.\n\nFor more details about Sri Kapoor's work and teaching schedule, visit the Arsha Vidya Center website.\n\nhttps://arshavidyacenter.org/\n\nThis interview is featured in the 3DVD set \"Science and Nonduality Anthology Vol.2\"\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

His grandfather first arrived in this camp in 1948 after the Israeli army expelled them from their home in the village of Khalda near Ramla.\n\nOn the morning of 4 January 2018, between 6:00 am and 8:00 am, Israeli soldiers stormed into Al Dheisheh Refugee Camp, seeking to arrest a camp resident. Clashes broke out between residents and soldiers in the center of the camp, and the chaos quickly spread to the outskirts of the neighborhood. Seeking an alternate entrance to the camp, the soldiers descended a hill and spotted a small group of boys awaiting their school bus. Hassan was one of the high school students at the bus stop, on his way to his final examinations and the last day of his high school career.\n\nThe chaos of the raid had reached the school bus area. Hearing the commotion, 17-year-old Hassan looked over his shoulder to hear the shouting from the military captain ordering his lieutenant to shoot at the boys. Hassan turned to see a frightened soldier, standing 15 meters away, discharge his firearm. He immediately felt a surge of pain in his back, knocking him backward as he collapsed. The sniper bullet had pierced his lung and lodged into his spine. Twelve minors were injured, with Hassan in critical condition. ‚ÄúI felt I was going to die. I started thinking of everything and everyone in my life. All I wanted was for the bleeding to stop and to feel my body again. I was completely paralyzed‚Äù ‚Äî Hassan.\n\nHassan was rushed to the hospital by car, with local camp residents personally delivering him to the ICU.\n\nThe staff at the ICU at Husayn Hospital in Bethlehem determined that Hassan had been shot in the 9th spinal disc with a special kind of bullet that expands upon impact, leading to a rupture of his spinal cord, paraplegia, and a loss of sensation. Hassan was then sent to Mizan Hospital in Hebron, where a specialist performed a bullet extraction surgery, noting the unusual nature of the bullet and the severity of Hassan's injury.\n\nAnd now?\n\nAs a result of this injury, Hassan is currently a paraplegic. That single incident profoundly changed his reality and the reality of those around him.\n\nHassan is now 21 and requires the help of his family to do the simplest tasks like moving, taking a bath or preparing a meal.\n\nA teenager at the time he was shot, he had been looking forward to graduating from High School with many dreams yet to achieve. ‚ÄúI wanted to become a nurse and be a good influence to my people of Palestine.\"\n\nHassan is seeking healing and rehabilitation. Hassan's dream is to walk and move again. He is still a young man and has not lost hope.

Evolutionary and developmental\nbiopsychology tells us what objects we can perceive. Cosmology tries to tell us what objects are there to be perceived. We are forced into anthropic or design arguments to explain \"why this universe?\" because even quantum cosmology spectacularly fails to do so.\n\nQuantum cosmology asks how the \"classical world\" of ordinary experience‚Äîthe world of\nobservers and observable objects‚Äîemerges from a quantum universe, one initially packed into a tiny, high-energy dot. The standard answer is decoherence, a process that encodes classical information about a bounded quantum system into its surrounding environment. Decoherence theory allows the precise calculation of what information about any bounded object‚Äîan electron, a red Ferrari, a human-habitable planet‚Äîits environment provides to observers. The boundaries between objects and their environments must, however, be specified as inputs to such calculations. The central question of cosmology‚Äî\"why this universe, and hence these objects?\"‚Äîis thus left unanswered.\n\nI suggest we abandon both the question \"why this universe?\" and the entire subsequent\nstory about emergence. A quantum universe is an entangled universe. Any two components of an entangled state encode classical information about each other. All such information is relational and conditional, not absolute or universal: it is information of the form \"if I am X, my partner is Y.\" Viewing observation as entanglement instead of decoherence suggests a universe full of energy but with no boundaries: no space, no time, no objects. What it would mean to live‚Äîand do science‚Äîin such a timeless, boundary-less universe is fascinating to contemplate.\n\nhttps://chrisfieldsresearch.com/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

We search for equanimity as if it's a state that can be found. The more desperate we feel, the more effort we put into our search. In crisis, we grasp for a collective narrative to explain our experience. We strive to find an official story. Whether we are striving to explain our experience or striving to attain a particular internal state, the process of striving is the same and leads to the same place: suffering.\n\nInstead, we might ask: who is it that‚Äôs striving and what is the result? We might also ask: what is left when we are not grasping for a collective narrative? What is it in us that longs for peace, well-being, equanimity and happiness? Are these experiences found through striving, or are they known through a different route? And what is that route?\n\nThese questions aren‚Äôt about finding the right answers. They are invitations to inquire into the nature of our experience, which can open the door to liberation‚Äîand the equanimity we seek.\n\nIn this interview, Caverly will explore these questions and illuminate the process by which we strive for equanimity-instead of realizing equanimity as a byproduct of who we truly are.\n\nThis talk is hosted by Vera de Chalambert.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Try to step out of now into a past or future. Where do we or could we go? It is not possible to experience a past or future. We experience thoughts about a past or future but never the past and future themselves. This very now is the only now there is. It is not a moment in time. There is no 'present moment.' There is no time present in which the now could move forwards or backwards. It is eternally now. \r\n\r\nUnhappiness is always an avoidance or rejection of the now. Our self, aware presence, is intimately one with all experience in the now. It knows no rejection of the now and is, therefore, happiness itself. The thought-made self is a movement of resistance or seeking, away from the now into an imaginary past or future. All avoidance and seeking is for the thought-made self, never for the true and only self of aware presence. The belief that time is real is essential to the perpetuation of this imaginary self; such a self feeds on the past and future. The now is the only place the separate self cannot stand. The now, in which all peace and happiness reside, is the only place the true and only self can be. \r\n\r\nAll the imaginary self's seeking longs only for the happiness that is inherent in the now. The imaginary self approaches the now like a moth approaches a flame. It longs for the flame but cannot experience it. It can only die in it. Likewise the imaginary self longs only for the happiness that resides in our self. However, it cannot experience it; it can only die in it. That death is the experience of happiness. This happiness lies at the heart of all experience, never imposing itself but never veiling itself, simply waiting with open arms to be recognized.\r\n\nhttps://rupertspira.com/\n\r\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Because of this, our culture has forgotten the traditional customs and rituals that keep the family involved, and we miss opportunities for healing and connection during this sacred transition.\n\nFamily-led home funerals offer a natural, sacred, affordable and ecological approach. Hundreds of families who have returned to the tradition of home funerals have afterwards repeated this statement, ‚Äúnow that I have experienced a home funeral I can‚Äôt imagine doing it any other way.‚Äù Instead of feeling fear at having their loved one‚Äôs body remaining at home for 1-3 days, they felt comforted, and reported that it helped them process and integrate their person‚Äôs death.\n\nThis presentation/interview will inform you of how families can create a personal ceremony/ritual for their loved one at home, from pre-planning consultations to the final destination for disposition.

Learning to die willingly before death allows us, paradoxically, to live more fully, and to die without regret.\n\nNetanel Miles-Y√©pez is an artist, religion scholar, and spiritual teacher. Born into a Mexican-American family, in his late teens, Miles-Y√©pez discovered his family's hidden Jewish roots and began to explore Judaism and other religions seriously. After studying history of religions and comparative religion at Michigan State University, he moved to Boulder, Colorado to study with the innovative Hasidic master and leader in ecumenical dialogue, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, founder of the Jewish Renewal movement. In addition to Schachter-Shalomi, he also studied with various Sufi masters and teachers of Buddhism, and counts Father Thomas Keating, Trappist monk and founder of the Centering Prayer movement, as an important influence. In 2004, he and Schachter-Shalomi co-founded the Sufi-Hasidic, Inayati-Maimuni Order, fusing the Sufi and Hasidic principles of spirituality and practice espoused by Rabbi Avraham Maimuni in 13th-century Egypt with the teachings of the Ba‚Äôal Shem Tov and Hazrat Inayat Khan. Currently, he teaches in the Department of Religious Studies at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. As a writer on religious subjects, he is known for his critically acclaimed commentaries on Hasidic spirituality (written with Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi), A Heart Afire: Stories and Teachings of the Early Hasidic Masters (2009) and A Hidden Light: Stories and Teachings of Early HaBaD and Bratzlav Hasidism (2011). He is also the editor several ecumenical works, including The Common Heart: An Experience of Interreligious Dialogue (2006) and Meditations for InterSpiritual Practice (2011). As an artist, Miles-Y√©pez is mostly known for his vibrant paintings, influenced by traditional religious imagery and his Mexican-American heritage. His work in general represents a lifelong fascination with religious iconography, myth and symbol, image and archetype, cultural impressions and his own ancestry. Most of his work is concerned with the acculturation and use of traditional symbols and iconic forms in a new multi-cultural paradigm. \n\nhttps://opensiddur.org/profile/netanel-miles-yepez/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

There is no way around that. The loss of a loved one is devastating. It breaks you down. It tears you apart. The life that you thought you were living is no more. The person you thought you were, has died with your loved one. As much as you might wish that it could be different, this is the stark reality that must be faced. The death of a loved one is a wake up call to reality. The reality that we do actually die. The dream bubble bursts and you are left standing alone with no one to hold your hand. You feel the roller-coaster of emotions. You feel the cycles between numbness to insanity. And all of this is a cracking open and open.\n\nWhen, nearly 3 years ago, her husband Robert Hanuman died, Unmani turned inside out. But right from the beginning, she could see the heart-breaking gift in it all. It was the gift of Love. The gift of seeing that our love never dies. The gift of seeing that Love is not dependent on a body. But also the gift of this cracking open and open. Paradoxically, even though she recognised this gift, it didn't save her from actually feeling the terrible, knife-stabbing pain. The human heartbreak goes on, and at the same time you know that it is only ever Love. Love holding you in the wild ride of being human. Love breaking you open to Love itself.\n\nIt continues to crack open and open to Love. It is a never-ending heart opening. She lives my love for Robert. She lives as Love. And love is not only the sweet feelings, but also the willingness to face and feel the intensity of everything that life brings, and let it continually crack you open.\n\nUmanu ‚Äì¬†http://www.die-to-love.com/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

His life is one of Hope and possibilities.\n\nThrough his teachings, mainly in the form of sacred verses, Rumi gifted us many themes for life to contemplate on, marinate in, and fully embody and manifest.\n\nThree of such themes that Pouria find relevant for our time include:\n- Discernment\n- Invitation\n- Prayer\n\nWith joy in his heart, Pouria offers three of Rumi's poems, each speaking to one of these three themes. He first recites them in their original language, the language Rumi uttered. Then he provides an English translation for each.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Dr. Julie Brown Yau speaks to the distressing effects of developmental trauma and how it creates the intense difficulties and challenges most of us face in adulthood. We explore how, for the young child, the simple yet terrifying experience of not receiving adequate holding, love, nurturance, or being delighted in, the descent into embodied personhood feels intolerable. An innocent core self-splits off, or parts of our young consciousness, retreating into the deep layers of the unconscious. \n\nBecause of the internal feelings of threat, trauma is born within the body. Many of us are unaware of this as we grow into adulthood, yet our lives are limited. In times of crisis, like we are amid today, the symptoms of early trauma often emerge, causing even more challenges, disconnection, confusion, and pain. We look at how to go beyond the symptoms, to dissolve the underlying dynamics, to find a sense of renewal and aliveness. We explore the importance of gently coming out of states of immobility and shutdown, how to safely be with our emotions, and how to integrate the disconnected parts of self to find a sense of coherency, peace and a deepened sense of spirituality.\n\nThis talk is hosted by Zaya Benazzo.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

The ‚Äúawe-full‚Äù qualities of horror and terror we can experience at such times share essential roots with profoundly transformative states such as flow, awe, presence, timelessness, and ecstasy as they reach far beyond the limiting mind.  The bridging of these states with everyday awareness can be a key feature of spiritual growth and expansion. It can promote the experience of timelessness and presence sometimes referred to in meditation systems as the eternal now.\n\nTrauma stands in the way of this integration by locking us up in a 'freeze' mode and inhibiting the activation that gives us access to the 'fight or flight' energized states. The ability to access and integrate this bound energy determines whether it will be debilitating or vitalizing. In yoga, awakening of the Kundalini has long been utilized as a vehicle for spiritual transformation. Trauma produces a similar mobilization of survival activation, but with such intensity and rapidity that it is overwhelming. We are unable to utilize this energy as it is bound to rigid and frozen response patterns. \n\nAs we bring awareness to our wounds and gradually access and integrate this energy into our nervous system and psychic structures, we begin to experience greater freedom, expansion and connection to our true self. As we integrate those wounds, the instinctual survival response embedded within trauma can catalyze authentic spiritual transformation. \n\nWhy attend?\nUnderstand the relationship between trauma healing and various spiritual states\nBecome familiar with the energetic basis of survival instincts\nDiscover how to work with altered states in dealing with the residue of deep trauma\nAccess portals to the deep self through the spiritual components of trauma\nRecognize how conventional approaches to spiritual practice can generate trauma\nPractice embodiment for effective (and safe) spiritual practice\nDiscover intersections between mystical energy systems and the modern scientific understanding of the nervous system\nIntegrate trauma as a doorway to nondual awareness\n\nWho is this online retreat for?\nThis will be an in-depth program, suitable for therapists, spiritual seekers and anyone looking for a profound, experiential understanding of the relationship between traumatic imprint and the spiritual journey. \n\nhttps://www.scienceandnonduality.com/webinar/sacred-wounds","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvT9vG4X-zs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvT9vG4X-zs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvT9vG4X-zs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvT9vG4X-zs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvT9vG4X-zs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":162,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"VvT9vG4X-zs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"aWlVOnLPDjLq_160BOKqrh75DBk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lmk5b0g1OV9haVRN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-16T07:00:15Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Practical Wisdom: A.H.

With both biological and physics perspectives suggesting that the human perspective of a ‚Äúseparate self‚Äù, reinforced with the messages of modern culture, may be only one part of a much larger view of the deeply interconnected nature of reality and the reality of nature, we can propose that part of the journey forward for humanity on this precious planet is to expand our consciousness and integrate our identity‚Äîwith practices like mindfulness‚Äî to embrace a wider view of who we truly are.

There has been much important talk from NGOs and foundations about the incorporation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge into whole fields of study and understanding, and this book will address that, as well as a much larger sense of TEK than is customarily thought of. It involves knowledge gained not only from pre-contact ways of life but from the ensuing generations of adaptation to another way of seeing life and Earth. It is a knowledge of how to endure and persevere, no matter the odds. As such, it must involve a very broad range of Indigenous perspectives and practices.\n\nThis interview by Lynn Murphy explored these questions:\n- What is this current crisis revealing to us that we haven‚Äôt wanted to see?\n- To open to indigenous cosmology and ways of seeing and meeting this moment, what do those with western minds and ways need to unlearn?\n- The beautiful film about Stan called Prayer for the Earth: An Indigenous Response to These Times highlighted the need to have right relationship with the Earth. Without this, there will be no climate solutions. We explore what is right relationship to the earth and whether this can be a moment of initiation.\n- What is role of grief and mourning in the current and coming transition?\n\nThis talk is hosted by Lynn Murphy.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

More than an emotion, grief is a core human faculty that enables us to metabolize the bitter losses that come to us, into a needed medicine for ourselves and the community. This skill develops slowly over time and requires that we take up an apprenticeship with sorrow as it invites gravity and depth into our lives.

We can use this time to step back from our worries and concerns, and draw on the clarity and wisdom that lie in the stillness of our being.\n\nWe'll need to be flexible, to let go of outdated thinking, habitual reactions, and assumptions as to how to respond, to find the inner freedom to see things with fresh eyes. At the same time we need to remain rooted in the ground of our being, so that we can stay cool, calm, and collected in the midst of whatever changes may come.\n\nBeing Here Now becomes ever more important.

Most fungi live out of sight, yet make up a massively diverse kingdom of organisms that supports and sustains nearly all living systems. \n\nFungi provide a key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel, and behave.

What drew you to study Science?\n2. How did you take the turn, from a promising young civil servant for the French government to a spiritual seeker?\n3. What is it in the world of science that touches you the most spiritually? Which are the scientific phenomena which most point to the nondual nature of reality?\n4. What is it, ultimately, that most unites the scientific mind and the drive of the spiritual seeker?\n5. Are there examples of great scientists who were also mystics?\n6. Is reality absolutely out of reach for the mind?\n7. We are living extraordinary times, with the world virtually brought to a halt by a microscopic piece of DNA. Some people will encounter death around them for the first time, and some people will come into contact with their fear of death. What do you say to them?\n8. What can we hope to learn in general from the crisis at hand?\n9. A lot of people are going to be depressed, staying at home, with no work, no hope. What advice would you give them?\n10. Why are so many conspiracy theories emerging now? What is the need in the human psyche?\n11. Now, as we are confined in our home, for some of us, tempers are flaring and conflicts arise. In some cases, there's domestic violence. Do you have advice for those of us who are caught in that loop?\n12. Do we ever outgrow our conditioning, or do we just become more intimate with it?\n13. Is there such a thing as living life bathing in beauty harmony and peace, or is there always room for less comfortable feelings?\n\nThis talk is hosted by Jeanric Meller.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Without the shading of soul, what could become wise can become way too sure of itself, too certain of the way and too blinded by the light.‚Äù\n\nListen to Michael Meade answer Zaya's burning questions: What has gone wrong with our world? What has led to the current polycrisis humanity is facing? How can myth and ancient stories help us understand and be with the current human and existential crisis? Can you share a story or ancient wisdom for times of Crisis? Are myths like ancient codes, archetypes that still live today in our psyche? Is crisis always spiritual in nature? Is there also a creative power in destruction? Do you see this as a moment of initiation? If so, to what?

His poetry is a call to see and feel what we are being given in every unfolding moment. To realize our perfection through the honoring of our flawed humanity and the deep honesty of the sacred earth. The seed of life is within us all, our dance here is mundane, strange and wonderful. Ben doesn‚Äôt bring answers but instead asks us to push our hearts and our lives up against the place where our finite hearts meet the great wave of life that is within and which contains us. At that merciful and merciless meeting point we catch a glimpse of the love that we are. Circles to draw close to each other and the mystery we carry. Poetry and spoken word to carry the vibration of wonder and remembrance of our own miraculous hearts.

Donald Hoffman introduced it as the Interface Theory of Perception. Hoffman also introduced his Conscious Realism thesis: the objective world consists of a social network of ‚Äòconscious agents‚Äô and their experiences. Thus consciousness creates all objects and properties of the physical world, reversing the traditional mind-body problem.\n\nUsing evolutionary game theory, we support interface theory with a theorem saying that perceptual strategies reporting the truth will, under natural selection, be driven to extinction by those tuned instead to fitness.\n\nA mathematically precise definition of ‚Äúconscious agents‚Äù is proposed, leading to a non-dualistic, dynamical theory of conscious process in which both observer and observed have the same structure, with many possible interfaces.\n\nIn support of conscious realism, we then discuss two theorems showing that a conscious agent can see geometric and probabilistic structures that are not necessarily in the world but properties of the conscious agent itself and different agents may see the world as having different (even incompatible!) structures. We will also discuss a way in which interfaces represent a dramatic compression of information which is functional to the agent.\n\nThis suggests that space-time is a description of location and dynamics on the perceptual interface of human conscious agents; that the ‚Äúobjects‚Äù of Physics are akin to icons on that interface; and that ‚Äúphenomena‚Äù appear as the interactions those icons seem ‚Äî to us ‚Äî to be having.\n\nWhat motivates a species to evolve its particular interface? Federico Faggin has proposed a mechanism for the evolution of interfaces: that it is the desire for comprehension, or self-knowing, that drives this evolution. What is required next is a theory of the process of self-knowing.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

For the same reasons we do. We live in an evolutionary world. A world of growth out of darkness and into greater expressions of Divinity. When we do not understand the importance of shadow work on the spiritual path, we can cause ourselves and those around us great pain and actually stall our own evolution.  Our ‚Äúshadow‚Äù is the evolving edge of both our human and Divine expression. The shadow arises when our unconscious mind tries to slow down, ignore or avoid growth on the path. Because God is both Absolute and ever evolving in form, if we ignore our shadow or our growing edge, we will fall from Grace and be forced to face that which we do not want to see. Therefore, in order to truly be free in an embodied way, we must be aware of and understand how to work with our personal, relational, professional, and collective shadow.\n\nHonesty, humility, sincerity, courage, and willingness are required to do shadow work. These same qualities are also the qualities of embodied awareness. As we courageously explore our shadow, our direct experience of awareness and true nature also deepens and this embodied awareness becomes the foundation for an abiding awakening. To the degree that you are conscious of both the Divine and Human aspects of yourself is the degree that you manifest awakened consciousness in the world. \n\nIn this talk we:\n‚Ä¢ explore the areas of shadow regarding trauma, addiction, and other disowned aspects of our humanity and Divinity.\n‚Ä¢ investigate anxiety and fear, sadness and anger, and their corresponding Divine expressions of open-heartedness, fearlessness, compassion and power.  \n‚Ä¢ open to our shadow and discover any disowned aspects of True Nature within and invite our fuller Divine Expression to come forward.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Using the beautiful mathematics of Fourier transforms, I will show that the ‚Äúlocation‚Äù of an object is not a real thing. All that is specified by the laws of physics is a ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù or path through space and time. It is only when two entities interact‚Äîwhat we call a measurement‚Äîthat the idea of specific locations and times become real. These represent the time and place of the interaction, not of the things in and of themselves.

Nonetheless, this question has largely been left unanswered. There exists a myriad of diverse and often conflicting theories speculating on where consciousness comes from, and how it operates. It is perceived as a wide spectrum within the human experience, from non-pathological ordinary wake to non-dreaming sleep, dreaming sleep, lucid dreaming sleep, orgasm, peak experiences, depersonalisation, sensory deprivation, the vast range of psychedelic states, just as vast as that of psychotic ones. Different schools of thought approached this as a material or spiritual epiphenomenon. We still don‚Äôt really know if consciousness is a product of the brain, of the whole body, or neither. Many neuroanatomical and neurofunctional brain structures have been speculated to hold the cornerstone of sentience, from the default mode network (DMN), to the claustrum, and more generally, the neocortex at large. However, this still poorly explains the seemingly astounding intelligence observed in organisms devoid of such structures, from invertebrates, insects, to plants and fungi, notwithstanding unicellular organisms and viruses themselves. Indeed, many key players suggested organic assembly like ourselves are merely a transducer of an external force permeating all that there is, from subatomic particles to the vastness of the void of the observable universe. Drawing from a vast body of neuroscience, pharmacology and electrophysiological research, with a pinch of philosophical inquiry, I attempt to shed more light on this evergreen dilemma.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Consciousness is the basic stuff our experience consists of. In that sense we can certainly say that the world arises \"in consciousness\".

Would the world exist without consciousness? Would consciousness exist without the world?\n\nThe consciousness/world circle is well represented in the ancient symbol of the ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail, or in Escher's drawing of two hands drawing each other.

In Zen, a gateless gate or barrier appears to separate us from truth‚Äîonly when we finally pass through it do we realize that the barrier doesn‚Äôt really exist and the separation was illusory from the start. Likewise, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of ground, path, and fruition: The ground of our Buddha nature is ever-present and all-pervasive, but until we embark on the path and realize the ground for ourselves, we never experience the fruition of our search.\n\nIn spiritual circles these days, we tend to talk about the nondual as an ontological reality, as if we all know exactly what we‚Äôre talking about. But traditionally, the nondual must be experienced, intimately and directly, as our very own true self, for it to become a living reality in our lives.

The active substances contained in these medicines, called psychedelics, hallucinogens or entheogens, are powerful substances that alter one‚Äôs perception, thinking, emotional and cognitive processing and can also induce strong spiritual and mystical experiences. Western science has technically discovered psychedelics at the end of the 19th century with the isolation of mescaline, while the biggest boom in psychedelic research and potential therapeutic use came out in the 50¬¥s after the discovery of LSD. After almost 40 years of prohibition these substances found a way back to human clinical research and nowadays we are witnesses of the renaissance of clinical studies focusing on their therapeutic potential. After isolated case reports and open label studies, controlled double blind phase II and III clinical studies are emerging, showing huge therapeutic potential of psychedelics in affective disorders, anxiety, addiction and other disorders. But at the end of the story, we are technically rediscovering the old knowledge and trying to match it to our modern western way of thinking.

They decoded this vortex of energy giving this \"power\" an anthropomorphic image and a mythical language, thus creating a spiritual technology to best enjoy the divine qualities in human energy.

We do this without intention or goal, because intrinsically there is a deeper movement in life that wants to bring together what has been separated. This is a movement towards oneness and healing. However, we need to leave behind personal concepts and ideas about how and when this should happen. Instead we learn to move beyond the limitations of our personal conscience and agree to that which is and to everyone as he or she is.\nWhen awareness matures one becomes able to see love at the source of every action. In turn this allows one to reinterpret one‚Äôs experiences and the actions of others as a resource rather than a deficiency.

The root of the word friend and freedom is the same, a clue to function as compassion within and without. Our true nature already does function this way, welcoming everything equally. A constancy that meets the ever changing with a resilience born of clarity, love, mountain strength, eternity, timeless patience and a strong dose of humor. Like Noah's Ark, this one heart that we are, welcomes aboard the animals or polarities, soothing and balancing them back to oneness. Joy and sorrow, freedom and bondage, ignorance and wisdom, tension and relaxation, hatred and love. All are resolved, dissolved and solved in the Stillness of the Heart. It is notable how wisdom can show us our true nature, but it is compassion, kindness and deep listening that liberate the body and mind from old fashioned services, the past and uncomfortable tendencies. Yes, wisdom, a felt sense of space, and enough rootedness allow us to slow down and be with what is calling us, rather than restlessly postponing or distracting ourselves. The unshakable knowing that not everything is as it appears to be, or only is its function, allows for a respectful curiosity. A deeper listening, slowing down from doing to being and suddenly, there is a true meeting. Heart to Heart. What a pleasure to be truly intimate within, and with what is from moment to moment. Neither running from or towards. Freedom and love exploring itself, meeting itself. Free to be, free to love and be love. Luckily, no time is required for beingness to be.

It takes a while before many of us discover that the way to genuine nondual awareness is through deeply embodied presence. Without this, our realizations tend to turn into memories, and lead to various dissociative or detached positions that are actually ego defenses against suffering. Yet central to the original teachings of the Enneagram is the idea that our core suffering can be transformed by bringing presence and compassion to it. Indeed, each of the nine points represent a particular transformational pathway from the dense suffering of egoic existence into the embodied qualities the awakened heart.

This presentation explores new research on group coherence and the importance of physiological synchronization in increasing group cooperation, collaboration, harmony and performance. The term coherence always implies harmonious relationships and connectedness between the various parts of a larger system. Social coherence can be achieved by the establishment of stable and harmonious relationships, between couples, within families, groups or people within larger organizations. A number of studies have shown that feelings of cooperation, trust, compassion and increased pro-social behaviors depend largely on the establishment of a spontaneous synchronization of physiological rhythms between group members. In order for physiological activity of individuals to synchronize, a signal of some type must convey information between them. The model that best fits the data from various studies is built on field theory and nonlocal information exchange where information about the entire group is simultaneously distributed to all of the group members, creating a ‚Äúsocial hologram‚Äù. We have suggested that biologically generated magnetic fields may act as a carrier wave for information transfer between individuals and group members. The most commonly found factor that underlies our ability to get in-synch with our deeper self, others, and the rhythms of the Earth is heartfelt connectedness and love.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Technology is creating the opportunity for this to trend to continue. There are times when there are good reasons for us to be in relationship with others because of mutual associations. However, we can experience difficulty in building and sustaining relationships when, despite our common association, we cannot actually relate to one another in our heart. Understanding is a good beginning, but it is not enough. We can understand someone and not be able to relate to them. Relating does not develop until you can perceive that whomever or whatever has something to do with you. Oftentimes, the culprit of our inability to genuinely relate in our heart is our adherence to the dualistic paradigm of ‚Äúotherness.‚Äù In this mindset, we simply fail to perceive our interconnectedness, let alone our oneness. Engaging in othering for prolonged periods of time cripples our very capacity to be in authentic relationship. We witness this on all levels from interpersonal family dynamics to geo-socio political affairs. Unbeknownst to us, we have created the equivalent of relationship gerrymandering in which we redraw the boundaries of who is or out of our sphere of connectedness. Rarely do they have any say in the matter. Forgetting that a relationship is merely a real-time reflection of how we are relating, we fallaciously believe that we can improve relationships without improving how we actually relate. It‚Äôs time for us to put ‚Äúrelate‚Äù back into relationship.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Deepening requires exploration. And for all its byways, exploration leads ultimately to the spiritual source of our existence and to the quest for a faith that will support our continuing explorations. Not since the days of Plato and Buddha and Confucius, some 2500 years ago, has there been such an uprising of spiritual yearning. Though the varieties of contemporary religious experience may look or sound different, they share a core belief‚Äîthat each human being contains a godseed, a divine essence that can be nurtured through spiritual practice into a fully matured expression of the god stuff within. \n\nMoreover, belief in a divine essence as the basis of reality is not limited to explicitly religious paths. Scientists of a Nondual bent explain reality in terms that are not much different from those mystics use. Speculative scientists often use the metaphor of the hologram to explain humanity's place in the Universal Mind. Each part of a hologram contains an image of the whole. Break a hologram image up, shine a special kind of laser light though any of its pieces, and you get the whole picture back again. In spiritual terms, we might think of ourselves as fragments of the great hologram of Reality. Shine the proper light of consciousness through us, and we each reflect the whole‚Äîstarfish and sequoias, the sap rising in the winter trees and the yearning of God for each of us. . .\n\nThis yearning to know our true nature is universal. When I have studied or talked with seekers who have had this experience, they have told me of a joy that passes understanding, an immense surge of creativity, a instant uprush of kindness and tolerance that make them impassioned champions for the betterment of all, bridge builders, magnets for solutions, peacemakers, pathfinders. Best of all, other people feel enriched and nourished around them.

To fully engage in a new way of being, the old story of separation needs to dissolve. To do this we need to diminish the structures that hold the old patterns in place. A key to clearing the obstacles that keep you limited or feeling disconnected is to resolve the deepest impact of early or developmental trauma.\n\nThis presentation dives into the depth and most difficult aspects of trauma healing, to reach a life beyond trauma. You can come to know a more loving and beautiful world is possible, one in which you can abide as love and in compassion. Undifferentiated anger, rage, and terror of annihilation are experiences that are often circumvented, hidden, or locked away in your unconscious. Unresolved they can obscure your true spiritual nature and realizations. You can find their healing properties and move into freedom. As you do so, new kernels of life are found, old structures drop away, and a spiritual awakening and a maturation are born out of the transformation.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

These cults, known as the Mystery Religions, brought a much-needed wave of fresh air to those who could not find any spiritual meaning in the Olympian religion, allowing for a real transformation of consciousness in the initiates. These practices, and the value-system associated to them, triggered a new religious and cultural movement able to join people from different origins, reconnect them with the ecstatic dimension of spirituality and the paradoxical nature of reality.\n\nChiara follows the cult of Dionysus along its evolutionary trajectory and explores the social, spiritual and political outcomes of ecstatic group rituals.

She shows how to engage in this movement towards a radical love of each other and how, through honoring the tapestry of difference, we build connection to the larger social world and a call to manifesting social change. If we see the sacred difference of others it will inherently pull us towards not only honoring that difference, but also protecting it in all the ways it is expressed in the world.\n\nShe explains the ways in which the science of mirroring neurons can offer a map into this practice of honoring sacred difference.

Harvard neurologist, scientist, and author Joel Salinas, MD, discusses what you and the people you care about can learn from understanding the profound science behind reality and atypical brains, including his own. Dr. Salinas has an extreme form of synesthesia where all his senses collide‚Äîtasting sounds, literally feeling what someone else is physically and emotionally feeling, and more.\nBe warned: Dr. Salinas will guide you through an immersive journey down the rabbit hole of his own wildly unusual sensory perception and, at several points along the way, you may learn something powerful about yourself that you never would have expected. Through this mind-altering, multisensory experience, he combines art, science, technology, and spirituality to reveal how we can use these neuroscientific aha moments to radically shape the world around us and within us.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Their deeper functions in regulating the body, either directly or through neuro-hormonal and neuro-immune interactions are largely unconscious and therefore neglected. This talk introduces theoretical models and experimental data suggesting an even deeper and evolutionarily older function of nervous systems: regulating the size and shape of the body. If these models are correct, the original function of neurons was the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Neurons still perform these functions, from early embryogenesis through adulthood. We may even, sometimes, be aware of them.

Her embryology approach is inspired by the work of Dr. Jaap van der Wal, an embryologist and anatomist and Rudolf Steiner disciple. She describes the descent into heart-mind consciousness and relates it to her own journey.\n\nTina was brought up under the shadow of Table Mountain, Cape Town, South Africa. Early experiences led her to study consciousness at the University of Cape Town where she completed a B.SocSc in Psychology and Sociology.  However not content to just know about consciousness, she decided to leave university and she began an inner quest. After working many years with the yogi and philosopher Srinivas Arka and practicing his method of meditation known as the Intuitive Meditation method or Arka Dhyana, she decided to return to University. Tina earned her MA in Transpersonal Psychology from Sofia University (ITP) California, and her PhD in Consciousness Studies from the International University of Professional Studies (IUPS) Hawaii. She is now an academic mentor at IUPS and also a certified teacher in the Intuitive Meditation method. Tina‚Äôs research includes investigating why the heart throughout the ages has been utilized as the center of attention in heart-based meditation practices. She also decided to delve into embryology and explore when and how the soul/Spirit manifests itself in and through the body and how myths have not only been used to explain reality, but also to effect the minds and hearts of people when there is a changeover in society - like from female goddess to male god religions. Tina has various publications on these topics. Dr Tina Lindhard is currently president of the non-profit organization CCASpain and chair of Consciousness Research of CICA International, a non-profit scientific Foundation. \nwww.tinalindhard.org\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Change can be disconcerting; yet in troubled times the inner threads of genius, imagination and wisdom become both more important and surprisingly more available.\n\nUpavita is an old Sanskrit term for the eternal thread of golden imagination that makes each life valuable and noble from the beginning.

While holding it, all the moments of our lives make sense; without it, all can seem accidental and pointless.\n\nCall it dharma or the inner law of our being; call it a life dream or a spiritual calling; we are each called to awaken to the inner plotline of a story trying to unfold from within. In learning to express the mythic pattern woven within, we learn to contribute to the renewal of community as well as a restoration of nature.\n\nWhat we need at this time is not a minor repair, but a major transformation of the world that can only start from the inside.

She discusses the application of these practices to healing from trauma. In the Realization Process we attune to the ground of our own nature as an expanse of undivided, fundamental consciousness pervading our body and environment as a unity. Knowing ourselves as fundamental consciousness facilitates resilience to emotional and sensory stimuli, the integration of cognition, emotion and physical sensation, and the capacity for deep connection with other people without losing inward contact with oneself.\n\nJudith describes how we constrict and fragment ourselves in reaction to trauma, especially as children, and also how we mirror the trauma-based constrictions of our parents, so that psychological pain and limitation is passed down through the generations. She demonstrates the Realization Process method for recognizing and releasing the emotional wounds, defenses and compensatory patterns held in the body that conceal our authentic nature. She also shows how nondual realization enhances the therapeutic relationship, by cultivating empathy, subtle perception, and authenticity.\n\nJudith presents some specific types of psychological issues that often cause suffering for spiritually oriented individuals. These include intolerable levels of sensitivity, a lack of grounding, a sense of isolation and alienation, a tendency to feel merged with or displaced by other people, and a desire for purity and perfection. She shows how the practices of the Realization Process can address these challenges and help spiritually gifted people live more comfortably in the world.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

It is true that love is fundamentally a universal dimension to our spiritual nature.

It is the same authenticity as in the presence of universal love, but with qualities useful for human relating, and important for the spiritual path.

If experimental proof is achieved, these processes would be shown to be the fundamental ‚Äúboot codes‚Äù of the living world. Cycled together they would then constitute an ‚Äúengine of creation‚Äù that continuously generates all of biology, human culture, technology and even conscious experience. The emerging understanding of this conceptual engine bears surprising parallels to the Dao and other spiritual systems. Ironically this highly reductionist work on our deepest ancestry may give us the great gift of unifying the dual magisteria of science and spirit. But if we all live by and within this engine what does this say about how and where consciousness operates and what does this tell us about our own free will and future? Dr. Damer guides the SAND audience on an illustrated journey from life‚Äôs beginning to some possible answers to these big questions. He concludes by suggesting a way to use the power of this engine to further evolve what it is to be human and how we might collectively realize a truly great destiny.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

She covers the role of embodiment and the place of shadow exploration in spiritual work, and much more.\n\nThe process of inner transformation is both spiritual and psychological. The spiritual work is about awakening to higher states of consciousness; the psychological work involves cleaning the psyche of all conditionings, psychological blocks, complex contradiction and traumas. In owning our shadows, projections and inner conflicts, we create a foundation for our spiritual life.\n\nTuriya's personal journey into human development started when she did her first 2-year Jungian Psychotherapy at age 22, followed by an encounter workshop in 1970 in Germany.  In 1971, Turiya and her husband were part of developing the first German Humanistic Psychology Growth Centre, known as Zist. The revelation and exploration of this Humanistic Psychology approach took Turiya by surprise. The internal shift that she experienced was so profound, that she and her husband, set on a new course of human discovery, which lead them to India. There, they discovered a revolutionary form of teaching from an Indian mystic.  Through learning meditation, living and working in a community under the guidance of a master, she developed a unique approach in working with people that is a synthesis of eastern insights, living awareness and western approach to humanistic psychology. The sudden, unexpected death of her husband marked a turning point in Turiya‚Äô life. This profound experience deeply influenced her own personal search and how she works with people today. Turiya has had extensive experience and training in leading personal development groups and trainings globally since 1973. Turiya's work transforms old rigid ego patterns into experiences of joy, acceptance and life affirmation. Through years of experience in working with different cultures and thousands of people worldwide, her work has now evolved into discovering how to be in the present moment and learning how to accept our human nature with all its darkness and all its light. She loves to work with people and is passionate in her own journey of feminine Awakening. Turiya Is a cofounder of a process called ‚ÄòPath of Love‚Äô and she leads a year-long Training in ‚ÄòWorking with People‚Äô, as well as running workshops that are held all over Europe, Australia and Brazil. Today Turiya lives in Australia and when she is not leading groups or is working with people she dives into painting and loves this creative expression.\n\nSee groups and trainings by Turiya:  \nwww.pathoflove.net \nwww.workingwithpeopletrainings.com \n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Compassion means to recognize the real nature of every living being, also in actions that express separation. Compassion means too see that there is not a person anywhere, but Consciousness in action. In this recognition you can welcome in your Heart all the suffering of believing that this is not so, knowing that maybe this cannot be seen through every form right away, but accepting seeing this in your Heart until it is possible for everybody. This is the life of a bodhisattva and the life to which we all aspire to as truth seekers. If this is possible, any action of Consciousness that expresses through your form will come from unity and will support only unity in the world. That compassion can do miracles, and arises from that true Heart that is everywhere, as Ramana Maharshi said.\n\nWhat can we do in front of a crumbling world in which everything seems to be more and more divided? We are Emptiness that contemplates all form through the human experience. The Heart is this Emptiness that meditates the world. Abiding in the compassion of the empty Heart allows us to dissolve any apparent contradictions and divisions we see in the world, not because we resolve these polarities but because they can all co-exist and dissolve in our Being. In the Heart there is no need to split ourselves into two and polarize into right and wrong, you or me, your truth or my truth - all this can simultaneously exist and be contained in Emptiness.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

The responsibility to do so does not belong to someone other than each of us. For it is we who posses capacities of loving and wisdom seldom fully realized or embodied in the world of time and space.\r\n\nAt the core of the spiritual heart lies two paradoxical instincts. One is the upward movement of transcendence and wakening up to reality, while the other is of the power and grace of redeeming love and the experience of unity as it expresses itself in the world of time and space. A full and inclusive spiritual life will take full account of both of these paradoxical spiritual instincts. For in the end we are called to wake up from the over identification with form, as well as to re-embrace and re-embody the grace of our true nature in and as the world of form.\r\n\nOur world is full of challenges and tragedies, opportunities and unlimited potential. To meet these challenges, both personal and collective, we need to act not from fear, resentment and conflict, but from love and wisdom. We need to experience and embody the power and presence of redemptive love.\r\n\nRedemptive love is an experience of love, given by grace, that at once redeems, meaning that it restores something or someone to their natural condition of wholeness. Redemptive love also seeks to be embodied in our humanity and challenges each of us to embody its grace in the very depths and actions of our humanity. Redemptive love is a love that is fully committed to being a wise and benevolent presence in the relative world for the benefit of all beings.\r\n\nWhenever and wherever redemptive love is present and embodied in our lives there is the fire of grace alive and active, and life is experienced as containing great meaning and purpose. The circle of spiritual awakening is completed only by literally re-embodying the spirit of awakened wisdom and love in and as our human life. Thus the redemptive power of love can become embodied and in-formed, and pour itself out upon the world.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Put simply, the essential teaching is 'The Absolute (Brahman) is the only reality, the world (jagat) is an appearance (of that nondual Absolute) and the sentient being (jiva) is none other than the nondual Absolute'‚Äîin Sanskrit 'Brahma Satyam, jagat mithya, jiva brahmaiva na para'. There is however, a secret to grasping this nondual teaching. The teaching is given in two steps‚Äîfirst, the well known 'neti, neti' 'not this, not this' leading to the realization of our spiritual nature and second, seeing that this newly discovered spiritual nature is nondual. Clarity about both steps is necessary to realize nonduality (Advaita).

Understanding and applying these intimate relationships can suggest therapeutic strategies and support the genuine transformation of traumatic experience.\r\n\nThe ‚Äúawe-full‚Äù qualities of horror and terror may share essential structural, psycho-physiological and phenomenological roots with those underlying transformative states such as flow, awe, presence, timelessness and ecstasy. Our organisms are designed with primitive-instinctual-proclivities that move us to extraordinary feats of focused attention and action when we perceive that our lives are threatened. The bridging and ‚Äúowning‚Äù of these survival capacities of readiness, ‚Äúslow motion‚Äù perception, and intense, focused, alertness with more ‚Äúordinary‚Äù states of consciousness promotes the experience of ‚Äútimelessness‚Äù and presence sometimes referred to, in meditation systems, as ‚Äúthe eternal now.‚Äù\n\nIn addition, the effect of trauma involves a profound compression of activation. The ability to access, and integrate the rhythmic movements of this ‚Äúbound energy‚Äù determines whether it will be destructive or potentially vitalizing.\r\n\nIn the Yoga‚Äôs of the East, awakening of the ‚ÄúKundalini‚Äù has long been utilized as a vehicle for spiritual transformation. In trauma, a similar mobilization of (survival) activation is evoked, but with such intensity and rapidity that it is overwhelming. If we can gradually access, titrate and integrate this ‚Äúenergy‚Äù into our nervous system and psychic structures then the instinctual survival response imbedded within trauma can also catalyze authentic spiritual transformation.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

The dissolving of the sense of separation allows the energy engaged in the false concept of ourselves to become available again to express our true individuality. From the false ‚Äúme‚Äù, to an authentic expression of you.\r\n\nAlthough it is always the true Self that is living the form, the illusion of the me filters out its expression, because the life force is watered down by it. Embodying the awakening means also therefore being able to express ourselves in all our natural talents and orientations. The body/mind finds a very natural pleasure in radiating effortlessly the joy of living.\r\n\nTranscending the sense of separation is therefore just the beginning of a new life in which the old ego-based goals become often obsolete. This can lead to a period of suspension of our energy, as we do not recognize ourselves anymore in the old ways, but we are not yet able to authentically express ourselves either.\r\n\nThe passage from being me to being I is a rich adventure that involves the dissolution of the thinking mind into a higher Intelligence, and the transformation of old contractions into radiance and joy. The shadows of the personality are transformed into new opportunities to give birth to the true You.\r\n\nThis alchemical transfiguration of the old identity is not done by the apparent person, but by Consciousness itself. Once purified from the illusion of separation, Consciousness emanates, out of its own Being, the possibility to be You‚Äìtotally human and perfectly divine.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.

Think of building San Francisco with the consciousness of a chimp. Take it further. Four billion years ago our planet was molten rock. That molten rock became chimpanzees. The crowning achievement of four centuries of modern science is our discovery of this innate, pervasive, astonishing, self-transcending creative power of matter. But modern English fails us here. To call it ‚Äúmatter‚Äù is to dump centuries of dualistic consciousness on it. Let‚Äôs call it creative energy and say it again: the magnificent achievement of empirically based, mathematical science is the stunning realization that we have been constructed by, and that we dwell within, ultimate creative energy.\r\n\nOne of the fundamental spiritual, social, and ecological challenges of our time is learning how to live into what we know. If we could experience in a direct way how every cow and fir tree required fourteen billion years of creativity to be here, our relationships with them and with all others would change. But the vast majority of us, certainly including myself, do not know how to experience the universe at this level in an ongoing way. No one does. No humans in the history of humanity had this knowledge, which means no humans in history had to learn how to be a human being as a mode of cosmic creativity. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we come to SAND. Our community is one of the nodes where a new form of humanity is struggling to come forth. We are groping forward, comparing notes, sharing insights, awakening experience, deepening consciousness.

After members of the audience offer examples of how climate change has affected them, the suggestion is made that what is happening here is in fact a funeral service, and what humanity is feeling is grief. There are rich presentations from the panelists, all of whom share the perspective that the issues we are facing arise from the attitude that planet earth is separate from us. The telling of myths and stories brings light to the discussion, which concludes that the beginning of the road to healing is the understanding that we are the planet.\n\nScience and Nonduality is a nonprofit organization, and we would love to have you as part of our community.

She describes the nature of the relationship between guru and disciple and transmission in the Baul tradition, and ends by singing a song of devotion to her guru, accompanying herself on a one-stringed ektar.\n\nIt is said in Bengal that the Baul tradition originates from a time unknown, beyond what human history can trace, from Lord Shiva himself. This year at SAND Italy we got a direct taste of this ancient lineage through Parvathy Baul, a renowned Baul folk singer, musician and storyteller who opened the conference with a sensational performance that transfixed and transfigured. The presence of the sacred in the room was palpable. Parvathy is a part of a living nondual wisdom tradition transmitted from teacher to student for thousands of years, song by song, melody by melody.\n\nIn every aspect of its expression Baul points to the nondual nature of reality. ‚ÄúThere comes a time when singing and not singing becomes one,‚Äù Parvathy reveals. ‚ÄúWhat is being sung is just a manifestation of the sound which we can experience with our senses, but there is also the sound of the Silence inside us, for which we don‚Äôt need the senses. When one becomes close with That, the singing  and not singing becomes one.‚Äù\n\nUnlike the traditions suspicious of the body and of human experience in general, the Baul tradition celebrates embodiment and sees singing and movement as a way to open the Higher Mind and incarnate it. ‚ÄúUntil you experience it in the body, it is not going to stay.‚Äù Parvathy explains, ‚ÄùSo we say, bring it down.‚Äù There is a deep trust in the presence of the divine within the mundane. ‚ÄúWhatever is here, I have to experience the divine with my body. Where should I go from here? I‚Äôm in the world and I have no other place to go. The goal is to experience the divine here by living it every day.‚Äù\n\nIt is difficult to listen to Parvathy's breathtaking melodies without something deep in the heart being profoundly moved. Her singing emerges of deepest devotion, evokes the great longing of the soul, offers a living thread, a lineage leading to the Feet of Reality. Parvathy, is a testament to the nondual heart of devotion. ‚ÄúMake your life into a prayer,‚Äù she reminds us in the interview we want to share with you today, ‚ÄúEvery action has to come from there.‚Äù\n \nJoin us at SAND US October 23-27 for five days of bringing down the sacred. This year we celebrate all the things science and nonduality From Quarks to Love!\n\n\nFurther information: https://parvathybaul.com/\n\nScience and Nonduality is a nonprofit organization, and we would love to have you as part of our community.

Our freedom is the freedom to be here, not to transcend form, but to be human as well as divine.\n\nSpiritual seekers often imagine that awakened living means ridding ourselves of our humanness, or that nondual awareness is somehow at odds with its own expression as human beingness. Egoic thought imagines that ‚Äúit‚Äù is what will become ever-present, compassionate and loving, and so continually falls short in its attempt to become what it will never become. Presence, compassion, and unconditional love are already here in our deepest essence, the Heart of Awareness that we share. Awakened living realizes that the Absolute and the relative dimensions of our Being are simply ‚Äúnot-two.‚Äù In such seeing, we honor What is already whole and undivided as well as its infinite expressions as life. Through discussion and experiential invitations, we will explore Presence and personhood, and look at ways to approach our inner struggles by not separating ourselves from them yet being willing to look deeply at where we are divided. We often need reminding, ‚ÄúWithout mud, there is no lotus.‚Äù\n\nFor more information visit https://www.dorothyhunt.org\n\nScience and Nonduality is a nonprofit organization, and we would love to have you as part of our community!

This allows a liberating realization: the root of suffering is an illusion, and all claims to knowledge are a pretense. \n\nThe first English translation of one of Eric Baret‚Äôs books, Let the Moon Be Free, is available on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/dp/1727646266).

His own practice, he says, has brought him nothing‚Äîit is a celebration of life, free of intention and totally purposeless. \n\nHis words are shaped and sustained by the nondual tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, and take us back to the simple observation of our felt sense of emotion and, ultimately, to pure listening.

He introduces entropy's complimentary expression, syntropy, as an attractor, the law that governs the invisible world, as opposed to the causality of entropy, which governs the physical world. He explains that life is a balance, as all our attempts to increase syntropy produce entropy, and the challenge is to increase syntropy with as little entropic action as possible. The key is to use the heart as a compass, as the heart is the chief instrument for detecting attractors from the future. One of the problems of the emphasis on entropy is that we feel we exist, but feel ourselves to be nothing, so find no purpose in life. Meaning can only be found when we unite the entropic universe with our syntropic self.

There is no need to abandon the belief in a physical world; it is only our poor understanding of physics that prevents us from finding consciousness in the physical world. It is our bodies that bring the world into existence, and our idea of the object is identical to the object itself; our experience of the apple is the apple. We don't have to look for ourselves inside the brain.

From an evolutionary perspective, however, this is not true. Considering our bodies from the perspective of deep evolutionary time, it is clear that they are not distinct from, but are rather continuous with, the bodies of other people and indeed of all other organisms. Our cell membranes and the cytoplasm they enclose are continuous with the membranes and cytoplasm of the very first cells. We and all of the organisms we see around us are appendages, organs, and sensory surfaces of a single, planetary-scale, almost 4 billion year-old organism that is exploring and altering the physical environment of Earth. What we call \"evolution\" is the developmental process of this organism from one to trillions of cells. We have only the most minimal understanding of this developmental process. However, rethinking our bodies from this deep-time perspective is perhaps useful for rethinking our minds and self-identities.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cQlmALw4GE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cQlmALw4GE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cQlmALw4GE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cQlmALw4GE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cQlmALw4GE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science

He is also a member of I.A.A.P. (International Association for Analytical Psychology) and of C.I.P.A. (Centro Italiano di Psicologia Analitica).

Since 1970, he has practiced meditation (mainly within Buddhist, Taoist and VedƒÅnta traditions), always preserving a non-confessional and non-dogmatic approach. After a natural and spontaneous fading out of both seeking and the seeker, only a radical non dualism prevailed in him. In this respect, his long-standing familiarity with the teachings of Nisargadatta Maharaj, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Tony Parsons was crucial. In the last ten years, he has been invited to give regular sat-sang in Italy. A survey of the nondual communication occurring in these meetings has been published in the book Il sorriso segreto dell‚Äôessere (Mondadori).","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kB8ypypQN2w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kB8ypypQN2w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kB8ypypQN2w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kB8ypypQN2w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":459,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kB8ypypQN2w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"e7aXxDrVEasw4g-z8h82DJB6v7M","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmE3OGpoaFh0WGdJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-02T18:00:06Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Pinnacle of Nondual Understanding: Rupert Spira","description":"In a welcome return to the time-honored practice of teachers commenting on the sacred texts of the past, Rupert Spira weaves a masterful commentary between the lines of the little-known book Know Yourself by the 13th century Sufi Awhad al-din Balyani.

How do we embody Rumi‚Äôs reminder that ‚Äúfighting and peacefulness both take place within God‚Äù, and not get caught in level confusion, spiritual by-passing and mere intellectual discourse? How do we meet the paradox of our humanity and divinity, our relative and transcendent experience, and live it as one integrated stream amidst daily life? Furthermore, how do we embody unity consciousness and walk practically through this world AS the presence of Love? In this experiential session, Miranda invites you deep into the heart of Being, through devotion, meditation, inquiry and discourse. Together, we will open into the loving awareness that welcomes everything to come home; explore what it takes to harness everything as a gateway to deeper into the Mystery; engage the practice of ego relaxation in the face of our defenses, and enter deeper into the boundless love and freedom of our true nature. At home within, we can relish the gift of life and turn our attention to being of service to our world in transition.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mzdm8CqFruc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mzdm8CqFruc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mzdm8CqFruc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mzdm8CqFruc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mzdm8CqFruc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":499,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Mzdm8CqFruc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"rZjtyYQn6yiHx0DU_j1t4yCAoh8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lkd0OHNlVjNQOXU0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-22T16:22:25Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Kristin Kirk: Embodied Bliss -- Living the Unknown","description":"Kristin Kirk describes her way of opening to the whole plane of consciousness, and leads a meditation to bring her listeners to\ntrust in the Unknown.\n\nSpiritual seekers often desire the idea of living a blissfully awakened and embodied life.

She will discuss how embodiment is an integral aspect of nondual realization. When we embody nondual realization, we know ourselves as subtle, unbounded awareness, pervading our whole body and our environment as a unity. Because nondual awareness pervades our body, we become more coherent and authentic as individuals at the same time as we transcend self/object duality. As the embodiment of nondual awareness, we can heal and deepen our capacity for love, pleasure, mental clarity, subtle perception and contact with other people. When two people attune to nondual awareness together, they experience mutual transparency: a single expanse of awareness pervading them both as a unity.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHr9i5Zlk-8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHr9i5Zlk-8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHr9i5Zlk-8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHr9i5Zlk-8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHr9i5Zlk-8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":502,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QHr9i5Zlk-8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tP__Nm82LODtJVRa5mjTezd_wxQ","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkRyM1VCajhwUDR3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-11T18:45:33Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Peter Russell: The Quantum's True Nature","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nPeter Russell speaks at SAND 2016 gathering about the nature of the quantum, light and its relationship to space and time.\n\nFrom the deep pools of Eastern wisdom, to the fast-paced rapids of the West, Peter Russell has mastered many fields, and synthesized them with consummate artistry.

There is nothing more intimate than directly knowing that we are one Being and consciously sharing that together. Although we all long for this intimate union, it cannot be found through relationship or sexuality that is based on a belief in separation and duality. In order to experience true love and intimacy we must come to know our nondual nature and begin to embody that in our relating. This presentation will explore how to embody nondual realization in intimate relationship in practical, real life ways, such as bringing nondual understanding into communication and conflict. The\nroot cause of all relational disharmony can be traced to the belief in duality, which leads us to seek love outside our self in others. Once the source of the problem is known and true love is awakened within us, it is possible to fully resolve relational issues related to our wounding and conditioning. When we bring the whole truth, absolute and relative, to our relating, relationship becomes a joyful meeting in our shared Being with a vast potential for further healing and awakening.\n\nLynn Marie Lumiere, MFT is a nondual psychotherapist with a focus on awakening consciousness and meeting life‚Äôs challenges as doorways to greater freedom.

This panel will be facilitated with an eye from the nondual view of consciousness, to ask questions and address issues in the study of consciousness that can help in looking deeper into the assumptions and conclusions of each theory.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vkwa_s2zmAQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vkwa_s2zmAQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vkwa_s2zmAQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vkwa_s2zmAQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vkwa_s2zmAQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":512,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Vkwa_s2zmAQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"u3vluHqDEwc7EvHfMN4bTbqsuZ8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LldzR3hxRU5BekJF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-30T19:25:08Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"John Prendergast: Aligning Our Lives with What We Know","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nJohn Prendergast describes the process of making our living congruent with our knowing, and leads us through a meditative experience to explore what we know that needs to come to the surface.\n\nJohn J.

Organic life is inherently vulnerable and uncertain, fraught with difficulties and dangers. Everything dies ‚Äì the human race, planet earth, our sun, the entire universe. Impermanence is a fundamental reality. We long for a permanence and security that is untouched by birth and death. Seeking this in all the wrong places, we slide easily into belief systems and ideologies, cynicism or idealism, dogmatism and fundamentalism. We keep trying to get hold of some final answer, some enduring experience, some permanent ground to stand on. And yet, whatever we grasp turns out to be doubtful, uncertain and unsatisfying. What if there is literally nothing to grasp? What happens if we are simply open, awake to what is? Life does not always feel good. But right at the heart of what seems most disturbing and unsettling, in the very place where we would least expect it, we may discover uncaused joy. In the midst of limitation, we may find true freedom. In thorough-going impermanence, we may discover the deathless unborn. And Here/Now, as messy and unresolved and imper- fect as today's weather may seem, we may discover the Holy Reality and the gateless gate to being liberated on the spot.\n\nJoan Tollifson invites us to wake up to the aliveness and freedom of open, aware presence, and to discover the simplicity of being this moment, just as it is.

Pre-modern philosopher Thomas Aquinas (13th century) declared that, \"a mistake about creation results in a mistake about God.\" Obviously we depend on scientists to teach us about creation or nature so there is a deep interdependence between spirituality and science and between a recovery of the sacred and the stories of awe and wonder that science can teach us. We will explore some of these connections, including a challenge from the Catholic monk Thomas Merton and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to the world of technology.\n\nMatthew Fox (b. 1940) is an internationally acclaimed theologian who was a member of the Dominican Order for 34 years.

Very often, awakening or enlightenment is imagined to be a spontaneous transcendent state that leads to eternal bliss and peace. But what is often missed is, that if awakening is to be more than a temporary state, we are called to meet every vestige of inner darkness and that this is an ongoing journey that can happen either before or after awakening. It‚Äôs an invitation to open to all previously unmet contractive energies based on an erroneous perception of separation. Inner darkness is where we hold on to inner division; it‚Äôs a blind spot with incredible power: the power to create suffering in ourselves and in the world. Amoda invites you to meet this suffering consciously, and then to choose to open wider than this suffering. Conscious suffering is the decision to walk with resolute presence and unadulterated openness through every inner and outer landscape through Heaven and Hell and to recognize what is true beneath and beyond all appearances. In conscious suffering, every step is a crucifixion and a resurrection. It‚Äôs a death of the archaic mechanism of ego and a rebirth into the light of who you truly are. When this light is seen in and as the heart of everything, a real transformation of consciousness takes place. As the Indian saint Neem Karoli Baba, said: ‚ÄúI love suffering, it brings me closer to God.‚Äù","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXlUsBYbv0w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXlUsBYbv0w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXlUsBYbv0w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXlUsBYbv0w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXlUsBYbv0w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":516,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HXlUsBYbv0w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9nHZuvloJSnb5slEG_2la8d3E6k","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkRTVWZRSDJNaEZN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-16T13:31:25Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Is the Soul Obsolete? Larry Dossey","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nIan Stevenson, the consciousness researcher who reported thousands of cases of children who claimed to remember previous lives, observed, ‚ÄúIt has been wisely said that the question of a life after death is the most important question that a scientist ‚Äì or anyone ‚Äì can ask.‚Äù He further stated, \"I believe it is better to learn what is probable about important matters than to be certain about trivial ones.‚Äù Research into human survival of bodily death has involved approaches such as near-death and out-of-body experiences, mediumistic investigations, children who report previous lives, evidence of global consciousness, and apparently nonlocal manifestations of consciousness such as telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis and precog- nition. In this presentation, physician Larry Dossey will explore the possibility of survival by examining the inadequacy of a materialist approach to consciousness, which forbids the possibility of survival of mind. He will show that a nonlocal model of consciousness implies infinitude in space (omnipresence) and time (eternality and immortality) for some aspect of who we are; and that, if unbounded in space and time, consciousness must in some sense be unitary and collective ‚Äì the ancient vision of the Universal or One Mind. An omnipres- ent, eternal, and unitary aspect of consciousness resembles the concept of the soul in many spiritual traditions throughout human history. Generally considered a religious and faith- based idea, it is ironic that empirical science is producing evidence that is favorable toward such a view. Thus, the concept of soul is decidedly not obsolete, but may be more grounded than ever. Dr. Dossey will also discuss the ethical implications of a unitary, collective aspect of consciousness for the many global challenges that currently confront humanity.\n\nDr. Larry Dossey is an internal medicine physician, former Chief of Staff of Medical City Dallas Hospital, and former co-chairman of the Panel on Mind/Body Interventions, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health. He is executive editor of the peer-previewed journal Explore: The Journal of Science and Healing. He is the author of twelve books on the role of consciousness and spirituality in health, which have been translated into languages around the world. His most recent book is ONE MIND: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters.

The human being has a range of subtle faculties for knowing, the totality of which we can call the spiritual heart. The science of the heart is a science of qualities, not quantities. Through the heart we can know this existence qualitatively. Behind the beautiful images and met- aphors of Sufi poetry lies a systematic knowledge of spiritual perception. When Rumi, for instance, speaks of the Beloved, he is describing a qualitative relationship with Being. The heart is the core of our subjective experience through which we experience relationship with other living beings, and ultimately with Being itself. Ultimately, knowledge and love are not two contrary functions, but a synergy through which we discover this communion and intimacy with the Absolute.\n\nKabir Helminski is a translator of the works of Rumi and others; a Shaikh of the Mevlevi Order, which traces back to Jalaluddin Rumi; co-director of The Threshold Society (Sufism.org); and a Director of the Baraka Institute (Barakainstitute.org). His books on spirituality, Living Presence and The Knowing Heart, have been published in at least eight languages. Among his recent publications are The Book of Language: Exploring the Spiritual Vocabulary of the Qur‚Äôan and Love‚Äôs Ripening: Rumi on the Heart‚Äôs Journey.

He joined the faculty of UC Irvine in 1983, where he is now a full professor in the departments of cognitive science, computer science and philosophy. He received a Distinguished Scientific Award of the American Psychological Association for early career research into visual perception, the Rustum Roy Award of the Chopra Foundation, and the Troland Research Award of the US National Academy of Sciences.

Hoffman studies visual perception, visual attention and consciousness using mathematical models, computer simulations, and psychological experiments. His empirical research has led to new insights into how we perceive objects, colors and motion. His theoretical research has led to a ‚Äúuser interface‚Äù theory of perception‚Äîwhich proposes that natural selection shapes our perceptions not to report truth but simply to guide adaptive behavior. It has also led to a ‚Äúconscious realism‚Äù theory of consciousness‚Äîwhich proposes a formal model of consciousness and the mind-body problem that takes consciousness as fundamental.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oadgHhdgRkI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oadgHhdgRkI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oadgHhdgRkI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oadgHhdgRkI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oadgHhdgRkI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":522,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oadgHhdgRkI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yrIX_XzOjklaWMUwdkWfVnb-3ic","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmZWWWI4eHFteFJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-01T01:08:01Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Emptiness is Also Form, Mukti, Francis Bennett, Loch Kelly","description":"At the Science and Nonduality Conference 2016, Loch Kelly, Mukti and Francis Bennett discuss the paradoxical understanding reflected in the famous Heart Sutra‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúForm is emptiness and emptiness is form.

Indeed it is one's self that is experienced as having one's experiences: one's sensations, emotions, memories, feelings of agency, feelings of thinking, deciding and acting, the very feeling of existing. Philosophical traditions encourage us to know ourselves, but also to not take ourselves too seriously and to not get too caught up with the wanting, thinking, deciding and acting \"ego\" part of the self. But what is this self experience, why do we have it, and what happens if it starts to unravel? I'll suggest that we should marvel at the experience of the self, and speculate as to why we have it.\n\nChris Fields is an interdisciplinary information scientist interested in both the physics and the cognitive neuroscience underlying the human perception of objects as spatially and temporally bounded entities.

Trauma is a normal part of life. Trauma often occurs in our early years when we are lacking the necessary resources to fully recover. Early trauma is the constellation that forms the limited self. This limited self continues to recreate itself throughout life, often hidden in the unconscious, until the trauma is resolved. Traumatic states have the power to throw us into deep despair, yet are also capable of radical transformation, in which compas- sion and expanded consciousness may emerge. The presentation will define the nature and characteristics of trauma, as well as its destructive and generative dimensions. We will also explore why somatic trauma resolution has an intrinsically spiritual core, and how it fosters the embodiment of something essential for being.\n\nJulie Brown Yau, Ph.D., SEP, is a certified NARM practitioner, and a dream pattern analyst.

The Christian contemplative mind was usually a subtext, and yet it was always clearly there too, and much closer to the surface, but only for those exposed to the mystical base that was revealed in the Gospel of John, the Desert Fathers and Mothers, the Celtic and monastic traditions, and what was generally referred to as the apophatic or wisdom stream of Christianity. These were our many saints and mystics. This possibility was brought to the fore by Thomas Merton in the middle of the last century, and is now flowing in many positive directions. It is now our task to rediscover the pre-Enlightenment Christianity that reveled in \"the cloud of unknowing\", what some called \"learned ignorance\", and the very notion of Mystery itself. Only when we got into competition with rationalism and secularism, did we adopt this rather recent mania for certitude and a very limited kind of scientific knowing. Almost the entire history of Protestantism emerged in this period, and thus the contemplative mind is an utterly new revelation for them, and frankly for all of us, as we again learn to be comfortable living on the edge of both the knowable and the unknown.\n\nFr.

Research at the HeartMath Institute demonstrated that our intuitive sensitivities are closely tied to this heart- brain and our heart‚Äôs rhythms. A specific rhythmic pattern of the heart, referred to as ‚Äúheart coherence,‚Äù has been shown to increase intuitive discernment and improve decision-making skills. I will present research on how heart coherence brings the physical, mental and emo- tional systems into balanced alignment for easier access to our heart‚Äôs intuitive guidance for simple or hard to make choices. Our choices are constantly determining our peace, happiness and self-security -- or the stress and decline of our well-being. Learning to utilize our heart‚Äôs intelligence is a natural gift we can refer to for moment-to-moment guidance, no matter what personal growth, spiritual path or religion we may practice. I will also present research on collective heart coherence and energetic connectivity, then teach the audience a heart coher- ence technique to amplify the group energetic field. I will do a live demo with a participant from the audience using heart coherence technology. Everyone will be given a worksheet and do an exercise to access their heart‚Äôs intuitive guidance in this amplified heart coherent field. The heart‚Äôs intuitive guidance can help us navigate through these changing times with more emotional poise, along with connecting us to our higher choices and untapped potentials. There is a growing global awareness that more heart and higher consciousness is needed to solve our societal problems. The potential of collective heart coherence and a deeper under- standing of the intelligence of the heart is that we can co-create a heart-connected world and a better future.\n\nDeborah Rozman Ph.D. has been a psychologist and executive for over 30 years.

You keep seeking for answers in ideas, books, teachings, in the known, and in a ‚Äúself‚Äù created by thought. Yet thought, which can only operate in time and duality, can only take us to the edge of the known; it cannot take us beyond itself.

That which sees the mind of confusion or clarity, and is awake to the presence of joy or sadness, the body‚Äôs contractions or its openness, exists in/as each one of us, and cannot be threatened. In our willingness to ‚Äúnot know,‚Äù yet remain intimately engaged, that which is most deeply true may reveal itself, deliver unexpected insights, open our senses to the whole, and dissolve the ‚Äúseeker‚Äù along with both questions and doubts.

The unknown for science eventually becomes the known, again and again, in a series of empirical discoveries, followed by literal articulations (conclusions), followed by more discoveries and more articulations, ad infinitum. Science thus displays an endless, indirect and piecemeal attempt at knowing. Classical Vedanta and Neo-Advaita presentations likewise cannot probe into the edge in consciousness, since they attempt to deny or transcend the known‚Äìnot understand it. Nondual theorists tell us with great confidence that ‚Äúthe Self is everything.‚Äù This ‚ÄúSelf,‚Äù however, turns out to be merely the Un-Manifested aspect of the Absolute‚Äìonly one side of the edge between the known and unknown. Advaita Vedanta subsumes the known into the unknown, dissolving the edge between them. Disappointingly then neither science nor Advaita Vedanta can explore the mysterious edge. I wonder if it is possible to approach this subject from an entirely different angle. Could a human body-mind manifest a bridge to the unknown through its own subjective intensity and then share it with others? Neither scientific method nor non-dualistic spiritual theories can bring us to the edge of the known, but perhaps, as a direct taste, Non-Dual Recognition, Ecstatic Devotional Feeling and Activated Kundalini Shakti interacting simultaneously might function as an energetic bridge offering a thrilling sensation of entering the edge of consciousness.\n\nhttp://www.davidspero.org/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aeZAa3vgHBA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aeZAa3vgHBA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aeZAa3vgHBA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aeZAa3vgHBA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aeZAa3vgHBA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":537,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"aeZAa3vgHBA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"d1U-sp6_GcL4Vg8LJJRUqVzSYko","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Ljg4bjdyMk5QS0lV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-01-19T15:16:30Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Conversation: Emptiness, The Edge of the Unknown A.H.

Hameed is the founder of the Diamond Approach¬Æ - a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.

Therefore, to know the nature or ultimate reality of anything that is known, it is first necessary to know the nature of mind. Whether the mind perceives a world outside of itself, as is believed under the prevailing materialist paradigm, or projects the world within itself, as is understood in the ‚Äòconsciousness only‚Äô approach that is shared by nearly all the great religious and spiritual traditions, everything that is experienced is experienced through the medium of mind. Thus, the first imperative of any mind that wishes to know the nature of reality must be to investigate the reality of itself. Everything the mind knows or experiences is a reflection of its own nature, just as everything will appear orange to one wearing a pair of orange-tinted glasses. Having become accustomed to the orange glasses, orange will become the new norm and, as a result, the wearer will imagine that the orange colour he sees is an inherent property of consensus reality and not simply the limitations of the medium through which he perceives. In the same way, the mind‚Äôs knowledge of anything is only as good as its knowledge of itself. Until the mind knows its own essential nature, it cannot be sure that anything it knows or experiences is absolutely true rather than simply a reflection of its own limitations. Thus, the ultimate question that mind can ask is, ‚ÄòWhat is the nature of mind?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWho am I?‚Äô and the ultimate knowledge it can attain is the answer to that question.\n\nFrom an early age Rupert was deeply interested in the nature of Reality. For twenty years he studied the teachings of Ouspensky, Krishnamurti, Rumi, Shankaracharya, Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta and Robert Adams, until he met his teacher, Francis Lucille, twelve years ago. Francis introduced Rupert to the teaching of Jean Klein, Parmenides, Wei Wu Wei and Atmananda Krishnamenon and, more importantly, directly indicated to him the true nature of experience. Rupert‚Äôs first book is \"The Transparency of Things,\" subtitled \"Contemplating the Nature of Experience,\".

Thurman","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nMany people think of Buddhism as a religion, but it is even more a science and a philosophy. In this talk and meditation, Robert Thurman elucidates how the Buddha discovered absolute relativity, 2500 years ahead of Einstein, through the rationally experimental and contemplatively experiential insight into voidness, or emptiness. The Buddha employed the truly scientific method of inquiry in the exploration of the reality of the self and the world. Turning to the nondual relative, he taught the evolutionary causality of karma as a well-evidenced, but not dogmatic, biological theory, long before Darwin and his successors. His causal evolutionary theory envisions compassion as the force that develops higher qualities in beings, intelligence, sensitivity, love, and contentment, and the bodily mutations that correspond to these qualities. Also in this session, Robert will bring the audience along with him experientially, by guiding a meditation on the process of realizing voidness or selflessness, rehearsing the entry to it through the opening of bliss awareness, and the transcending of its transcendence that leads to the embrace of the nondual relativity of love. Finally, he will critically examine the common pitfalls that seekers tend to fall into, such as the use of emptiness as a path of separateness rather than a path of union, and also the misguided nihilistic view of voidness as nothingness. He elucidates the concept of ‚Äúbare awareness.‚Äù The only way to ‚Äúget‚Äù reality is through a ‚Äúbare,‚Äù i.e nonconceptual, awareness, which melts the boundaries between subject and object.\n\nRobert A.F.

On the one hand, our incredibly successful theories are internally consistent, quantitative, predictive, and contradicted by essentially no established experimental data. On the other hand, as we look more deeply into the foundations of those theories, and as well look at more complex systems, deep questions abound: What does quantum mechanics really mean? Is our universe just one of many, and what does that mean? How do we account for agency and freedom in a purportedly deterministic universe? Many of these questions sit at the profound rift between our personal subjective, conscious, experience of the world, and the objective, mathematical fundamental physics view of the world. After reviewing some of the elements of our contemporary fundamental physics view, I will argue for several assertions as to how we might bridge some of the gap between that view and our subjective experience. First, I will argue that *information* is as real, and perhaps more real, than the ‚Äústuff‚Äù information is generally considered to be about. Second, I will argue that from this stand- point, more ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù does not mean more ‚Äúreal‚Äù and that macroscopic objects and laws should not be considered ‚Äúnothing but‚Äù regularities that have emerged from a ‚Äúmore real‚Äù fundamental theory. Third, I will argue that in a cosmological context, much or all information may be ‚Äúindexical‚Äù information ‚Äî the type pertaining to our subjective perspective (including location in time, space, branch of the wave function, universe, etc.!) In this way, I argue that our own subjective experience ‚Äî and place in a community of others ‚Äî is just as real, and just as central, to the World as is the physical system described by our ultra-successful fundamental theories. \n\nProfessor Aguirre researches fundamental questions in early-universe cosmology, cosmological inflation, gravity, black holes, and quantum theory. He is currently organizing a research program run through the Foundational Questions Institute on the ‚ÄúPhysics of the Observer‚Äù, spanning disciplines including artificial intelligence, biophysics, foundations of quantum mechanics, and cosmology.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdbXucXtWFg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdbXucXtWFg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdbXucXtWFg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdbXucXtWFg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zdbXucXtWFg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":544,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zdbXucXtWFg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"lSDXCoAjR9EIa19R5upi3t4_q9I","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Li04bDlWX1poTXVJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-12-31T20:15:52Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Mark Deutsch and Laura Inserra SAND16 Opening Night Concert","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/ \n\nSAND16 opening concert with Mark Deutsch and Laura Inserra.  \n\n\nMark Deutsch can best be described as a 21st century Renaissance man. A professional musician since the age of twelve, he is a visionary artist with a background in non-linear mathematics, sacred systems and cosmology. As a classically trained bassist and sitar player he gained extensive experience in orchestral and world music ensembles, jazz combos, and solo sitar performance. While studying sitar and North Indian classical music with the legendary Ustad Imrat Khan, Mark began delving deeper into the universal fundamentals of music and their underlying frequency structures which also saw him embark on his quest to develop an instrument that could reproduce his findings. This work culminated in 1999 with Mark being awarded the US patent for his ground breaking new instrument the Bazantar - a five-string acoustic bass fitted with an additional twenty-nine sympathetic strings and four drone strings. The result is a remarkable instrument that weaves a mesmerizing soundscape of resonance, and evokes all the power of Western classical music with the depth and nuance of Eastern traditions. \n\nSince the creation of the Bazantar, and the critically acclaimed release of his first solo album ‚ÄúFool‚Äù, Mark has been performing extensively world wide. His awe-inspiring solo sitar and Bazantar performances have drawn rave reviews from the international music community and have generated invitations for Mark to perform at the Juilliard School of Music, Merkan Concert Hall, The Hawaiian Contrabass Festival and many other high profile festivals and venues. He is no stranger to film and theatrical composition having written and performed the theatre score for a much lauded French production of Steven Berkoff‚Äôs adaptation of Poe‚Äôs ‚ÄúFall of the House of Usher\" and several independent films. On the collaborative side, his music has attracted an eclectic array of some of today‚Äôs finest musicians, including Grammy award-winning cellist David Darling, film composer David Julyan (Insomnia, Memento), seminal Chicago rock band Tortoise, virtuoso erhu player and principle soloist with the Beijing National Symphony Yang Ying, multi-instrumentalist Jaron Lanier and jazz luminaries such as William Parker, Roy Campbell, and Hamid Drake. Mark currently resides in San Francisco while working on his second solo release.\n\n\nLaura Inserra is a composer, multi-instrumentalist, and artistic director. She is a classically trained musician with a strong improvisational background. A native of Sicily, her work in Italy is well-known, including integral participation in the composition of numerous movie scores and the artistic direction of innovative live productions. Inserra performed internationally in prestigious festivals and theaters in Italy and the US that include: The Colosseum (Rome), Auditorium Parco della Musica (Rome), Teatro Olimpico (Rome), The Chapel of the Chimes (Oakland), CounterPULSE (SF), NOHSpace (SF) and San Francisco City Hall among others. An internationally acclaimed Hang player, Inserra has collaborated with various artists globally. The Hang has been dubbed as ‚Äúthe new instrument of this Millennium‚Äù. Her performances are infused with a unique blend of musical inspiration and melodic harmonies which deeply resonate with audiences worldwide. In 2007 she moved to the Bay Area and she founded Samavesha, a non-profit multidisciplinary performing arts organization. Audiences worldwide are not only mesmerized by this woman but also captivated by her virtuosity, profound musicality, and the passion that she brings on the stage.\nMore info: http://www.laurainserra.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8l9V_ZhMuI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8l9V_ZhMuI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8l9V_ZhMuI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8l9V_ZhMuI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8l9V_ZhMuI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":545,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-8l9V_ZhMuI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Hxoq5z3Ezrr8oJwA_DB2lrIZ1zg","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lmt4UEk2UTFIV1p3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-12-27T21:16:41Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Living at the Edge of the Unknown, A .H.

It is derived from a practice done by the healers, or shamans, of indigenous shamanic cultures. It is performed to gain insight and effect healing, and has been a common practice of many indigenous cultures for thousands of years. Isa Gucciardi, Ph.D., is an early pioneer of adapting the shamanic journey to a therapeutic practice. Her unique style of teaching the journey includes a process of inquiry that is transformative and helps students step fully into their own personal power. In this workshop, Isa will offer an overview of shamanic healing practices such as power retrieval and soul retrieval and demonstrate how the shamanic journey is fundamental to these methods of healing  and how these ancient methods of healing are relevant in today‚Äôs setting. In traditional settings, the journey is used as an access point to what in shamanic practice is called the spirit world. \n\nIn Applied Shamanism, which Isa has developed over 20 years of therapeutic practice, the journey is used in this way as well as a vehicle for understanding and resolving personal issues. With a focused and disciplined practice, the journey becomes an excellent vehicle for the exploration of the unknown. Through the journey, students learn how to establish reliable relationships with what in shamanic practice are called ‚Äúhelping spirits.‚Äù Isa places particular emphasis on helping students formulate the kinds of questions that will offer the most insight and in helping students learn how to interpret the responses they receive. She helps students understand how to use the journey to bring empirical inquiry into the world of spirit so they can establish a reliable vehicle for the exploration of even the most complex areas of their experience.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R917ndnIeLg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R917ndnIeLg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R917ndnIeLg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R917ndnIeLg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R917ndnIeLg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":549,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"R917ndnIeLg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZgvhuMXpjiEi-ywKlavontoe2OM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LlNhMnp2bTJqam80","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-12-13T19:53:52Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Awakening the Luminous Mind, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nAt the core of the Dzogchen teachings is the view that all sentient beings are primordially pure, perfected, and have the potential to spontaneously manifest in a beneficial way.

This is not a philosophical observation but a \"must be so\" when it comes to such baffling dilemmas as the origin of life and the appearance of consciousness. The seven universes reflect human perceptions about reality itself. They are; Divine, Classical, Relativistic, Quantum, Uncertain, Conscious and finally, Human. The Human Universe, which is based on the undeniable fact that any universe is only knowable through the human mind's ability to think about reality. If all knowledge is rooted in human consciousness, perhaps we are viewing not the real universe but a selective one based on the limitations of the brain. This last proposition leads to the conclusion that the apparent evolution of the cosmos since the Big Bang has been parallel to, and totally dependent upon, human\nconsciousness. We are the conscious agents who create reality in our own image. Although totally contradictory to physicalism, the Human Universe may be completely necessary if we have any\nhope of solving the remaining Big Questions concerning the inexplicable emergence of life and conscious beings in a cosmos that has no necessity to produce either.\n\nDeepak Chopra M.D., F.A.C.P., Founder of the Chopra Center for Wellbeing .

That duality usually becomes our perspective on life. We project that duality on to everything. We either have something or we don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have it. We are happy or we are sad. We are right or we are wrong. We won or we lost. All distinctions have their place, but only as transitory points of view, present for the survival of an organism. Regarding true self-realization, which is non-dual realization of self, nothing can be excluded. True non-duality also includes whatever appears to be dual. With inquiry, non-dual unity can be found in the core of all perspectives including duality. Often on the spiritual search, we seek an experience of non-duality by transcending physical, emotional, mental and circumstantial aspects of living. Transcendence implies leaving something behind. In this meeting, Gangaji demonstrates how through self-inquiry, non-duality can be directly experienced, with no need to leave anything. When we are willing to stop rejecting, fixing or controlling our very human experiences, there is the opportunity to discover the ever present truth of non-duality: pure consciousness, pure spaciousness. Gangaji invites us to welcome all aspects of ourselves in all states and forms, even the most difficult of experiences, so that we can discover inherent fulfillment.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpjUNwKfCnY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpjUNwKfCnY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpjUNwKfCnY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpjUNwKfCnY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xpjUNwKfCnY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":572,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xpjUNwKfCnY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ojzX0n1R8QYO6J-thvxt2pFrIGU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnhLODhyQl9ZdjVB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-08-02T07:04:19Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Prior to Being - Nisargadatta Maharaj","description":"\"When the body is over, everything vanishes.

Its mission is to get this story taught in schools all over the world so that children will gain a sense of who they are in a grand scenario that gives meaning to their lives. Thousands of teachers are already signed up on its website and using its teaching materials in their classes, thrilled to have such a Big Story! Yet this story is limited to that of western materialist science, in which consciousness is a late emergent product of material evolution, and western dominator history, neither of which fairly reflect global cultures' understanding of our universe and world.\n\nThis talk is devoted to alternative, ‚Äì as ground of being‚Äîin equally scientific stories that challenge this story to open to respecting the highest intellectual and scientific works of other human cultures that see consciousness as primary in both universe and our Earth world. Such worldviews also see the universe as alive and intelligent, with human meaning and purpose being to promote the spiritual values of caring and sharing that have been buried by greed and consumerism‚Äîvalues that must be revived if we are to navigate through the perfect storm of crises whipped up by the consequences of material science, by countering it more effectively with scientific and historic stories leading to a peaceful, harmonious world.\n\nIn this session we will explore these alternatives and dialogue about ways to bring our understanding of Cosmic and personal consciousness into the Big History Project.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKBrGQhGRaM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKBrGQhGRaM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKBrGQhGRaM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKBrGQhGRaM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKBrGQhGRaM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":576,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"wKBrGQhGRaM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"H_dcJvdNMC_PGZlk5DO6qeKZ7HQ","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmRGSVZ0RlVfNEtr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-07-08T23:14:35Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"How Awake is Your Love Life? - Marlies Cocheret","description":"https://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nAn Exploration of Sexuality & the Ground of Being\n\nWhen we awaken to formlessness, that doesn‚Äôt mean we fully live it in our body. Welcoming Presence into sexuality, another aspect of Truth unfolds. Lovemaking begins with resting as awareness. Letting go of all effort, we fall into our natural body experience while surrendering to the vibration of our senses. Then, the lovers come together in the one movement of love, revealing ever more the immensity of stillness and deliciousness that we are. Why is it so difficult to remain as love?

He also contributes regularly to philosophical venues (e.g., Mind, Phenomenology & Cognitive Sciences; Review of Philosophy and Psychology) on topics including, but not limited to the self, memory, consciousness, philosophy of science, and temporality. Among Klein‚Äôs current interests are refining the conceptual specificity of terms used often with unwarranted abandon in psychological empiricism (e.g., self, memory, time, consciousness). In addition, he is interested in the degree to which radiological analyses of the mind (e.g., fMRI) are diagnostic of underlying mental constructs.

When we live as an expression of that aliveness and engage it in service of compassion and justice, we are truly working for a new world. In this workshop, Adam Bucko shares his own struggles and stories, stories of the homeless kids he has worked with, as well as lessons he has learned from his mentors.

What I discovered was that the divine transcendence I was seeking was not found outside the human, but was found precisely by going more deeply into it and embracing it fully. In this talk I would like to share these insights about integrating our human journey toward emotional maturity into the spiritual journey of awakening to the transcendent dimension. I would like to share a bit about how this process has been working in my own life, giving practical pointers about how to live this out in concrete ways in daily life. Rather than trying to deny and destroy the vulnerable humanity I found in myself and those I lived with in community, I have found that by embracing it, by fearlessly accepting all the dark and painful places within myself and others, I could actually discover that unconditional openness that was at my heart's deepest center, that place within that never grabs on to the 'pleasant', that never pushes away the 'unpleasant', but is simply and beautifully and unconditionally present to whatever shows up in experience.\n\nWhen we practice embracing what seems vulnerable and 'unacceptable' within us, this very embracing touches that consciousness which is essential to who we are. It helps point us\ntoward pure being itself, 'the Ground of being' within us all at our own heart's center.\n\nFrancis Bennett was a Roman Catholic, Trappist monk for a number of years. He lived in two monasteries of the Trappist Order in the US and was also a member of an urban, contemplative monastic community originally founded in Paris, France in 1975. He has lived in France at several monasteries, and in Canada at a small monastic community in Montreal Quebec. He received a five and a half year monastic/spiritual formation with the Trappists before he made his vows as a monk at Gethsemani Abbey in 1983. He graduated from the Pontifical College Josephinum with a BA in Philosophy and completed a two year residency in Clinical Pastoral Education with Ohio Health Hospital System in Columbus, Ohio. He has worked in ministry in the area of spiritual Care in the hospice movement, as a hospital chaplain and in spiritual care of the sick and dying in parish settings. He has lead retreats in both the Vipassana Buddhist Tradition and in the Christian mystical/contemplative Tradition. In 2010, while in the middle of a Church Service in his monastery in Montreal, Francis suddenly experienced what he has come to call, ‚Äúa radical perceptual shift in consciousness‚Äù, in which he discovered the ever present presence of spacious, pure awareness. He came to see that this awareness is actually the unchanging essence of who he really is and always has been; the Supreme Self, talked about by many sages and saints from many spiritual traditions down through the ages. He also came to see simultaneously, that this vast, infinite sense of presence at the center of his being (and at the center of the being of everyone else on the planet) is actually not at all separate from the presence of God, which he had been looking for during his many years as a monk and spiritual seeker. http://findinggraceatthecenter.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-AFftO9Id-c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-AFftO9Id-c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-AFftO9Id-c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-AFftO9Id-c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-AFftO9Id-c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":586,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-AFftO9Id-c"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"gW6-bHEFk0iIfoMDg97Q-j1ptgs","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmZlRG5EZU9HYWJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-05-23T21:48:02Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Consciousness & Awareness Are Not the Same: Stephen LaBerge","description":"Is consciousness the same as awareness, or do the two words refer to different dimensions of perception?\n\nAccording to world expert on lucid dreaming, Stephen LaBerge, consciousness is awareness plus mind and the structure of the individual brain. \"That's a critical understanding,\" he says, \"Consciousness does have to do with the brain, but it's not awareness.

We only have to remain as awareness if we don't really know that this wall is awareness, that your car is awareness - once we know that, then we're finally free, are we not?\"\n\n- Adyashanti","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO_PQGcrGYA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO_PQGcrGYA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO_PQGcrGYA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO_PQGcrGYA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO_PQGcrGYA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":589,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YO_PQGcrGYA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"OPp1RElVsPyfGJHPRtH2LsFpAoU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LldYMDMyemlLS2Fj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-05-12T21:26:58Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Lucidity, Poetic Synthesis and Creative Consciousness - Fariba Bogzaran","description":"Lucidity, Poetic Synthesis and Creative Consciousness \n\nThe creative mind and the dreaming mind share a similar space. In creative process, the spontaneous epistemic uncertainty allows innovation and insights. The dreaming consciousness unfolds narrative tapestry of images, sound, thoughts and emotions. Metacognition in dreams (lucidity) becomes a new event to witness and participate inside the mind‚Äôs creative action. In this presentation, through poetic synthesis, projected images and music, the space of lucid mind is invoked. The presentation‚Äôs goal is to create the ‚Äúdream space‚Äù in waking to allow the unexpected and creative consciousness emerges in lucid waking.\n\nFariba Bogzaran founded the Dream Studies Program at JFK\nUniversity where she taught for 25 years. She conducted the first major scientific research project on transpersonal experiences in lucid dreaming. Her art-based research focused on the phenomenology of lucid dreaming and modern painting, which led to the concept of Lucid Art. With painter Gordon Onslow Ford, she co-founded the Lucid Art Foundation in 1998. Her publications include: Extraordinary Dreams and How to Work with Them; Lucid Art and Hyperspace Lucidity; and Integral Dreaming: A Holistic Approach to Dreams.

As this energy condenses it becomes more differentiated and\nvisible to the human eye as physical form. As this condensation occurs, certain traditions believe that the initial ‚Äòstep‚Äô into the body occurs at the third eye, or the brow center. At this same location is the third ventricle, a space in the middle of the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Amazingly, this same fluid space, bordered by the pituitary gland in front and the pineal gland in back, has been referred to as the ‚ÄòCrystal Palace‚Äô and the ‚ÄòCave of Brahma.‚Äô The CSF is home to many neurotransmitters and signaling molecules providing an elaborate range of biological functions. The CSF utilizes volume transmission and its information can potentially be quickly dispersed and simultaneously target key brain regulatory centers due to its fluid nature. Interestingly, at the back of the third ventricle, in the middle of the brain, the CSF condenses and aggregates into a thread-like structure known as Reissner‚Äôs fiber that extends the entire length of the central canal of the spinal cord. The precise role of this fiber is unknown. Could it have a role in conveying vibratory signals from the fluid itself? In addition, the CSF contains the ‚Äòspirit molecule‚Äô DMT that is released by the pineal gland. Nisargadatta Maharaj said, ‚Äúfluids come together and the ‚ÄòI Am‚Äô appears.‚Äù The CSF may\ntherefore serve as a vehicle for immediate signaling to major control centers of the brain and may be significant in regulating consciousness and the sense of ‚ÄòI Am‚Äô.

This mistaken belief perpetuates the myth of enlightenment handed down by a patriarchal paradigm, and creates a division between an imaginary transcendent state of being in which only the perfection of bliss prevails, and the messy, chaotic and often painful earthly world. Even in the recognition of awakeness, there is frequently a subtle but pernicious avoidance of the blood, sweat and tears of the human experience. The full bloom of awakening comes when awakeness has descended from mind to heart to body, and every cell of your being now dances and sings with the joy of this realization: this cannot happen without the deepest acceptance of duality. The awesome mystery of consciousness expressing itself as both dual and nondual is perplexing and unacceptable to the linear thinking mind. But it becomes a koan - a doorway to the inexpressible - when we shift to holistic way of experiencing reality.\n\nToday, as more ordinary people awaken and then wonder how to live the truth of awakening, this shift is becoming an imperative. Amoda invites you to consider that this is a sign of a new feminine frequency in which our earthly experience is wholeheartedly included in the play of consciousness. And she invites you to consider that this feminine frequency is calling us into a new conversations about how the truth of awakeness is experienced and expressed in everyday life.\n\n\nAmoda Maa offers a gentle yet uncompromising pointer to authentic freedom. Her teaching ‚Äì which is free of all dogma, ideology or tradition ‚Äì has evolved out a direct experience of awakened presence amidst the depths of personal suffering. Having taken many years for this nod-dual awareness to integrate into ordinary life, today she offers satsangs and retreats to a growing global community. Her invitation is into the untamable fire of truth and to live the luminosity of this truth amidst the mystery and mess of human existence.\n\nAmoda Maa is the author of How to Find God in Everything and Change Your Life, Change Your World, and is currently working on a third book called Radical Awakening. She is also the founder of the ‚ÄòFoundation for Conscious Change‚Äô, a non-profit organization that supports her teaching.\n\n http://www.amodamaa.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57M6-iEGyrs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57M6-iEGyrs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57M6-iEGyrs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57M6-iEGyrs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/57M6-iEGyrs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":592,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"57M6-iEGyrs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qJs-39rO4rIzLVyFlPnZgvY4eVc","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LlF4dEtpU3BLWngw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-04-19T22:47:07Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Trauma, the Imaginal, and Awakening, Julie Yau","description":"As our conception of consciousness expands to include what was once unconscious, a greater awareness develops that embraces others, the natural world and the cosmos, while potentiating opening to primordial awareness. These important dimensions will be discussed and explored in the context of healing trauma.\n\nThe process by which a trauma heals is inherently turbulent, often complex and rarely occurs in a linear sequence; however, each dimension of recovery provides a broader context and wider possibility of meaning to the individual‚Äôs experience and consciousness. When trauma is healed, especially early trauma that arrests the development of aspects of our consciousness, an authentic spiritual awakening may occur, allowing people to reconnect to themselves and the world. Included in the presentation on resolving trauma, will be a focus on the imaginal, the intermediary realm that links the sensuous world of matter and the invisible world of mystery and spirit. Our culture has stripped the body and imagination of its mystery and numinosity, yet these elements are vital in most spiritual traditions for awakening. We may benefit from recognizing that the separation of the psyche from the spiritual domain is the root of a large problem. The psyche has been alienated not only from spirit but also from nature, the body, and people‚Äôs very lives, partly through the severing of imagination. We will explore how the imagination holds a reality creating potential, which is often uncovered through trauma, altered states of consciousness and extreme emotional states. The manifestation of the imaginal may allow one to reclaim their authenticity, and to open the truth of nondual awareness, or simply the inclusion of the imaginal in one‚Äôs everyday spiritual practice will assist with one‚Äôs spiritual illumination.\n\nJulie Brown Yau, Ph.D., SEP, is a certified NARM practitioner, and a dream pattern analyst. Using a unified approach for addressing developmental and shock trauma, Julie‚Äôs work includes the latest neuroscientific and psychosomatic findings, and Eastern wisdom.

The sense of beauty is not an aesthetic concept or sentimental\nfeeling but a powerful throb within consciousness, a reflection of its own magnificence. Although some traditions dismiss creativity as nothing but volitional activity and therefore causal in its nature, if we are opened to another possibility we might uncover the inner artist and the very reason behind existence. Extreme sensitivity to beauty‚Äìwith harmony as underlying structure of all formations‚Äìstupefies the mind of its entanglement in dual structure of the brain, even if momentarily, giving one direct and palpable experience of unity amidst diversity. This, when cultured enough and brought to the level of one-pointed recognition ‚Äì from cathartic experiences in the arts of various forms, to most mundane of encounters in daily life ‚Äì culminates in a highest state of Aesthetic Rapture. At once, an outpouring of creative impulses and bathing in the light of one‚Äôs own self-recognition. This is an invitation to re-evaluate the nature of experience and to reclaim your divine status. The only quest here is in beholding life awakening through you as existence itself.

Are we separate from this ever-present, ever-changing happening? Are we in control of it? Is anything that shows up actually a distraction or a mistake? Is anything lacking or in excess? Do we really know what anything is? Is this event we call the universe made of atoms and molecules or is it pure consciousness? Is it physical matter or a dream without substance? Is consciousness an experience of the brain, or is the brain an appearance in consciousness? Perhaps our debates about\nwhich comes first‚Äöthe chicken or the egg, mind or matter‚Äö assume divisions and entities that don‚Äö actually exist in the ways we think they do. The bare actuality of present experiencing is immediate and impossible to doubt.

The survival response embedded within trauma has the potential to catalyze authentic spiritual transformation. Similarly, as our essential wholeness is rediscovered on a spiritual path, trauma can be met with greater compassion and an appreciation of the interconnectedness to self, nature, and the cosmos. Spiritual realizations can allow us fearlessly to touch into the death-like void that is often at the root of trauma. When early trauma, dissociation, and/or intergenerational trauma has occurred, however, the spiritual path can be an unconscious means of avoiding the resolution of trauma and full embodiment. The panel members will discuss their views and insights on the seeming two paths and the significance of recognizing the importance of uniting them for our overall well being, increased consciousness, and spiritual unfolding.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ErrQ9O4CB5E/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ErrQ9O4CB5E/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ErrQ9O4CB5E/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ErrQ9O4CB5E/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ErrQ9O4CB5E/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":603,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ErrQ9O4CB5E"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"V0mmFnBzTozIf6Z6mAfFy0CYie8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LlBvekdyWHZUbFRj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-01-27T17:11:42Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Lucid Dreaming with Alan Wallace, Stephen LaBerge, Fariba Bogzaran","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nA panel with Alan Wallace, Stephen LaBerge, Fariba Bogzaran and\nmoderated by Daniel Deslauriers.\n\nWhat do Eastern and Western philosophy, neuroscience and phenomenology have to say about the experience of lucid dreaming?

In founding the Kiloby Center for Recovery, Scott has employed a \"trauma first model\" which helps clients struggling with addiction to examine and dissolve key traumatic events from earlier in life before going deeper with presence work. Scott says that skipping over early trauma can result in escaping and seeking behaviors continuing in adulthood. Often, people do not make the connection between trauma and addictive seeking. But seeking is escape from pain. At Scott's Center, he and his staff of facilitators use the Living Inquiries and other mindfulness-based approaches to resolve trauma and ultimately come to rest in the peace of the present moment. The Kiloby Center for Recovery is the first U.S. treatment center to focus primarily on mindfulness/present moment awareness to treat addiction, anxiety, trauma and depression. \n\nScott Kiloby is the creator of the Living Inquiries and Natural Rest for Addiction and the author of six books. He is also the co-founder of a new addiction treatment center in Palm Springs, California called \"The Kiloby Center for Recovery.\" When Scott is not working at the Center, he travels around the world giving talks on non-dual recognition and its application to very human issues such as addiction, anxiety and depression.

He argues that the roots of this reductionist view of the world are in our unresolved and unacknowledged childhood traumas. The good news, however, is that these traumas can be resolved through the process of self-inquiry. As Carl Jung said, \"Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.\" By looking inside, we liberate ourselves and remember who we truly are.\n\nEdward Frenkel is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, which he joined in 1997 after being on the faculty at Harvard University.

Almaas & Karen Johnson","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nNondual Relationships with H.A. Almaas & Karen Johnson;\nmoderated by Rick Archer from \n\nA. Hameed Ali was born in Kuwait in 1944. At the age of eighteen, he moved to the USA to study at the University of California in Berkeley. Hameed was working on his Ph.D. in physics when he reached a turning point in his life and destiny that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature.\n\nHameed‚Äôs interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach¬Æ:\n\n‚ÄúThe Diamond Approach is a path of wisdom, an approach to the investigation of Reality and work on oneself that leads to human maturity and liberation. Because of our particular vision of Reality it is not completely accurate to think of this approach as spiritual work, for this work does not separate the spiritual from the psychological, neither does it see these two as separate from the physical everyday life and scientific investigation of the content of perception. However, because we live in a society where the prevailing thought is that of the separated facets of Reality, the closest category recognized in this mentality, to our approach, is that of a spiritual path or exploration.‚Äù\n\nSome of Hameed‚Äôs many books: Runaway Realization: Living a Life of Ceaseless Discovery The Power of Divine Eros: The Illuminating Force of Love in Everyday Life The Unfolding Now: Realizing Your True Nature through the Practice of Presence Brilliancy: The Essence of Intelligence (Diamond Body Series) Essence With the Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization\n\nWebsite: http://ahalmaas.com\n\nKaren Johnson is a co-founder of the Diamond Approach as it is taught in the Ridhwan School, a contemporary original spiritual understanding and path, expressing timeless wisdom on self-realization using the insights of our time. She is a colleague and friend of Hameed Ali (A.H. Almaas). Her life is dedicated to the discovery of inner freedom and sharing the treasures with humankind.\n\nIn this interview, we discussed how the Diamond Approach is evolving, what differentiates it from other traditions, and the most recent developments of the past 15 years, about which Karen and Hameed have only recently begun to teach, speak and write.\n\nNeither the depths of spirit nor the surface of the mundane world can adequately express what reality is and what is possible for each of us. How can our human lives be both the arena for spiritual practice and enlightenment, and the occasion for our true being to express its infinite possibilities?\n\nWhen we realize that we are each the miracle of matter and spirit and at the same time we are neither, our everyday ordinary experiences can become doorways to further possibilities of reality, of awakening to our spiritual potential in its endless possibilities. True Being lives through the particulars of our lives, utilizing them to reveal its potentialities. The Diamond Approach explores how to use our personal situations as occasions for practice and learning, and as opportunities for expression of our finer spiritual qualities. It enables people to work with their everyday experiences of work, relationships, play, creativity, love, sex and so on to learn to be the transcendent living a human life. Its students learn to employ each particular situation within this world to go beyond it in a way that includes it. Inclusive transcendence enables our human consciousness to view reality beyond the concepts of duality and nonduality. Each particular situation affords us the opportunity to use its energies and forces to liberate and optimize our experience. Following such path, it becomes natural to be of help to others and to life in general.\n\nBook: The Power of Divine Eros: The Illuminating Force of Love in Everyday Life\n\nWebsite: http://ridhwan.org\n\nRecorded 10/25/2015 at the Science and Nonduality Conference.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpQ_HVVbPhU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpQ_HVVbPhU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpQ_HVVbPhU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpQ_HVVbPhU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TpQ_HVVbPhU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":618,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"TpQ_HVVbPhU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"cCmf1-mSh1blCj0gg2XeWTjq_dQ","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmlYNWFHa3Zpdkow","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-12-10T23:08:57Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"SAND18 Gathering in Italy","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nJoin us for SAND17 Gathering at Titignano castle near Orvieto, Italy July 3 ‚Äì 9, 2018.\n\nScience and Nonduality provides a forum where preeminent scientists, philosophers, teachers, artists and a large, international community gather to explore and advance the new paradigm emerging in spirituality, that is both grounded in cutting-edge science and consistent with the ancient wisdom of nonduality ‚Äî the deep understanding of the interconnectedness of life.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX5aGkvivJ0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX5aGkvivJ0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX5aGkvivJ0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX5aGkvivJ0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iX5aGkvivJ0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":619,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iX5aGkvivJ0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"aB7WxOdJBslLTi7sfl8hIlFXZhU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmotV0o0YWxUMjlF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-12-09T18:09:26Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Awakening as Intimacy With a Living Universe, Duane Elgin","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nWe may tend to think of ourselves as physical beings and regard ‚Äúawakening‚Äù as an experience that happens inside our biological brains and bodies. Yet, a nondual view does not regard awakening as happening exclusively within our physical bodies; instead, it is an experience of relationship that occurs when the deep aliveness within ourselves connects with the unbounded aliveness of the larger universe. When our life connects with the aliveness of a living universe, we awaken into an oceanic and unbounded sense of self. This view does not assume the universe is ‚Äúalive‚Äù like a biological organism, instead it regards the universe as being infused with a unique life-force that sustains all that exists. In turn, our physical bodies are biodegradable vehicles for acquiring soul growing experiences by connecting with this larger aliveness.\n\nIn this session we will explore three, major areas: \n1) how the frontiers of science view the universe as a unified system that is infused with an ecology of consciousness, \n2) how the world‚Äôs wisdom traditions regard the universe as being continuously regenerated anew at every moment, and \n3) how science and spirituality converge in a nondual understanding\nof reality and what this means for our everyday lives‚Äîthe source of the ‚Äúpower of Now,‚Äù the meaning and purpose of our lives, our relationship with our consumer society and the natural world, and pointing out a path of awakening as resting in the creative aliveness of a living universe.\n\nDuane Elgin Speaker, Author, and Social Visionary\nDuane Elgin has an MBA from the Wharton Business School, an MA in economic history from the University of Pennsylvania, and an honorary PhD for work in ‚Äúecological and spiritual transformation‚Äù from CIIS.

But these correlations remain as mysterious today as they were to Huxley. Most neuroscientists assume that brain activity causes conscious experiences, but they have not yet proposed a scientific theory‚Äîor even a remotely plausible idea‚Äîabout how this might happen. I argue, using evolutionary game theory, that brain activity cannot cause our conscious experiences or our behaviors. The mystery of how brain activity causes conscious experiences has not yet been solved, and never will be solved, because brain activity does not and cannot cause conscious experiences. If we want to have a scientific understanding of consciousness, and of the many well-documented correlations between brain activity and conscious experiences, then we cannot start with brain activity or physical dynamics of any kind. We must start with a brand new, but rigorous, foundation. I propose a new foundation which models consciousness as interacting networks of conscious agents. I motivate and present this new theory of consciousness, and use it to solve some of the open problems in the field of consciousness, such as the problem of combining conscious experiences to create a new conscious experience, and the problem of combining conscious subjects to create a new conscious subject. I then consider how we can try to understand the correlations between brain activity and conscious experiences by using the theory of conscious agents to derive generalizations of supersymmetric quantum theory.\n\nDonald Hoffman Ph.D., Cognitive Scientist and Author\nDonald Hoffman has authored more than 90 scientific papers and\nthree books, including Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We\nSee.

Over the past 140 years, cognitive scientists have likewise proposed a diverse array of definitions of consciousness and theories attempting to solve the mind-body problem. Materialists have tended to dominate such discourse, with some arguing that subjective states of consciousness must be equivalent to brain processes or their emergent properties, while others deny the very existence of subjective, conscious experience. Virtually none of these theories lend themselves to scientific validation or repudiation; they do not appear to moving towards any kind of consensus; and they all lack of any rigorous means\nof investigating subjective states of consciousness firsthand. In other words, they have all overlooked a key element that initially set ‚Äúnatural philosophy‚Äù apart from all other branches of philosophy and theology in the 17th century: the precise, rigorous observation of the\nnatural phenomena under investigation. While all subjectively experienced mental processes and states of consciousness are undetectable by the instruments of technology, they can be\nobserved with refined attention and introspection. William James, one of the foremost pioneers of experimental psychology and neuroscience, proposed that introspection should play a central role in scientifically exploring the mind. But ever since the rise of behaviorism in the early 20th century, his radically empirical approach proposal has been ignored. Buddhist contemplatives,\non the other hand, have adopted this radically empirical approach for millennia, and they have established a large body of consensual knowledge. Thus far, their methods and discoveries have been almost entirely overlooked by the scientific community and the general\npublic.

The modern study of consciousness re-emerged in the early 1990s from the shadow of behaviorism (which had banned the topic during most of the 20th century) following well-regarded scientists like Francis Crick, Gerald Edelman and Sir Roger Penrose, and interdisciplinary conferences such as ‚ÄòToward a Science of Consciousness‚Äô. Now, decades into the modern era, understanding is divided along the same ancient lines. (1) Materialist philosophers and cognitive neuroscientists liken consciousness to a computer simulation, and the brain to a computer, with neuronal\nfirings and synaptic transmissions equated to ‚Äòbit states‚Äô and switches in silicon (rendering consciousness epiphenomenal and devoid of causal power). Sufficiently complex computation is presumed to result in consciousness, and billions of dollars and euros are aimed at ‚Äòmapping‚Äô brain neurons and connections, with the hope such maps implemented in silicon will reproduce brain function including consciousness (although such mapping strategies, e.g. for simple worms, have thus far failed). (2) Quantum approaches, e.g. based on intra-neuronal structures such as microtubules, once considered unlikely at warm biological temperatures, have gained ground due to plant photosynthesis utilizing quantum coherence, and discovery of quantum resonances in microtubules. Quantum approaches connect brain function to fundamental spacetime geometry, consistent with ancient Eastern views of consciousness\nintrinsic to the universe.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKAVgq99o_w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKAVgq99o_w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKAVgq99o_w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKAVgq99o_w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKAVgq99o_w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":632,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hKAVgq99o_w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yqQ07u8p-yYL9YUvpwM3bjpscHY","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lnc2cmZJS052cWJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-11-06T02:41:52Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Primacy of Consciousness, Peter Russell","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nWave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, the collapse of the wave function, and entanglement all point to awareness being an intrinsic aspect of reality. Yet we are still trying to understand these phenomena within a worldview that assumes the real world to be that of space, time, and matter, and relegates consciousness to some artifact of brain processes. Yet the one thing of which we are certain is that we are aware. And it is the one thing the current worldview cannot account for. This profound anomaly will ultimately lead to the full paradigm shift to which contemporary physics is, unwittingly, pointing. With consciousness as primary, everything remains the same and everything changes. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry are unchanged. What changes is our assumption as\nto what they are describing. They are not describing the unfolding of a physical world, but the unfolding of a universal self-aware field.\nWe are led to the conclusion that the entire cosmos is a vast field of knowing, knowing itself, and in that knowing creating for itself the appearance of a material world. Why then don't we see it that way? Why does the material world appear devoid of consciousness?\nLooking for consciousness in the material world ‚Äì the world that appears in awareness ‚Äì is like searching a map to find the paper on which the map is drawn.

As far as physics is concerned, consciousness is like free will - it characterizes\neither nothing or everything. Since we are conscious, it is reasonable to regard everything else as conscious, too. If we make this assumption, the question of interest becomes: what systems\nare conscious of what? Physics is fundamentally a theory of interaction, so it can tell us a lot about this. The first thing it tells us is that being conscious of something requires expending energy. How much energy a system can expend determines how much it can be conscious of.

Each tradition has developed different approaches and practices to explore the nature of consciousness, the paths of meditation, inquiry, prayer, art, mantras and movement‚Ä¶\n\nToday the main lens through which our culture understands reality is science. For the past century science has viewed consciousness as something generated by the brain, yet there are major problems with this assumption. A new scientific paradigm is emerging which views consciousness as fundamental. Consciousness cannot be explained in terms of the existing laws of space, time, mass and energy. A new science has to be developed, a science that can accept consciousness as universal while investigating the connections between the existing laws and this new paradigm.\n\nWe might not yet have a theory of consciousness, but the process of studying it holds the key to understanding the universe, while possibly bridging the gap between the mystic‚Äôs experience and the scientific observations.\n\nJoin us to explore this great mystery of existence beyond dogma and doctrine, remembering that life is far more mysterious then we ever imagine!

Kabbalistic methods apply specific approaches for analyzing and interpreting a wide range of meaningful information, and in this presentation these approaches will be demonstrated for a description of biological systems. Although the word ‚Äòlife‚Äô is a noun, something is very fundamental in description of life through processes that distinguish living systems from non-living systems. The properties specific for living systems such as an ability to grow, to reproduce, to die, to metabolize, to maintain internal balance, to adapt to external environment, and to develop hierarchical organization are inseparably linked and interrelated. Kabbalistic approach is not limited to perceiving organisms in terms of isolated elements, but rather is applied to their integrated relationship in the context of connection and meaning. Connection of elements of biological systems can be described in terms of non-locality measuring closeness as a similarity. Two organisms, which resemble each other, are close; in contrast, biological objects that differ are distant. Generation and maintenance of biological diversity is a crucial characteristic of life, but multiplicity of forms can be studied in the way that visible manifestations indicate underlying unity behind the diversity produced by adaptation to local environment. Life manifests itself as pulsation; the principle of \"run and return\" is one of the life's secrets. Biological systems behave as a whole having numerous elements with their own temporal scales. Time in biology is measured through transformation of life forces. Kabbalistic approach is based on personal experience of the biologist and the task selected for a point of view: on what level you investigate the biological process; from which side you look at the biological object; what system of measurements is appropriate; what is a value of your observation?\n\n\nMichael Kosoy PhD is a Research Biologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ZlFTJMMzOo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ZlFTJMMzOo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ZlFTJMMzOo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ZlFTJMMzOo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ZlFTJMMzOo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":752,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8ZlFTJMMzOo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"uPMmnvGvOtDgEGaUeEt8YxRWSCc","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkFPWmpvdmppbER3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-03-21T00:52:49Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Suppression of Nondual Mathematics: A Tragedy in Three Acts, Newcomb Greenleaf","description":"Today‚Äôs mathematical orthodoxy is profoundly dual, visioning a timeless world of absolute truth, a world separate from our contingent, temporal lives. This ‚ÄúPlatonist‚Äù view has ancient roots, but did not become mathematical orthodoxy until the Set Theory created by the German mathematician Georg Cantor was adopted as a ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù for all of math, over the period 1880 to 1900. There have been two significant challenges to this Platonist hegemony: first by the Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer from 1915 to 1930, and later by the American Errett Bishop from 1966 to 1973. Before exploring this history, we must ask how nondual math is different, and why non-mathematicians should care. How does nondual math shed a new light on such concepts as ‚Äúexistence‚Äù, ‚Äúequality‚Äù, ‚Äútruth‚Äù, and ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù? Nondual math by its human focus is naturally hospitable to ethnomathematics, and naturally sensitive to racism and sexism in math classrooms. We use our first two acts‚ÄîCantor‚Äôs sets and Brouwer‚Äôs logic‚Äîto provide context for an extended look at Bishop‚Äôs heroic, ill-fated, seven-year campaign for mathematics to embrace its nondual, constructed nature, a movement I saw from the inside. We will look closely at the methods of suppression, which were systemic rather than organized, and which achieved extreme marginalization rather than extermination. Why is nonduality so difficult for mathematicians to understand? Personally, I doubt that I would have replaced my Platonist faith and achieved a nondual vision\nwithout sustained mentoring from a good friend who was close to Bishop. As a student I had received a thorough indoctrination into Platonism, along with a belief that Brouwer had gone crazy. I note that even today, decades after Bishop showed that nondual math worked, math students are never given the choice of thinking nondually.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOZjovjilDw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOZjovjilDw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOZjovjilDw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOZjovjilDw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":753,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"AOZjovjilDw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"rPwjvtHRnDcUaN1D3tT8hR2G_H0","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkFDMENlUHNWMnJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-03-21T00:48:41Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Non-Dual Conscious Realism ~ Neil Theise","description":"We propose a generalized theory of ‚ÄúNon-Dual Conscious Realism‚Äù addressing the fundamental issue of consciousness. This theoretical framework posits the universing arising from an undifferentiated, non-dual field of pure conscious awareness. From within this universal consciousness emanate the complementary phenomena of Planck scale quantum vacuum and quantum foam, generating space and time, matter and energy.\n\nThrough successive, recursive, creative interactions, phenomena and entities at each level of scale self-organize into emergent phenomena and entities at each next higher scale, comprising the entire cosmos. These triadic principles of complementarity, recursion, and creative interactivity (wherein ‚Äúsentience‚Äù is the special case of the biological) are reflected throughout all scales. Though emergentist/materialist positions predominate in contemporary discourse regarding consciousness, the primacy of this non-dual conscious reality, which we emphasize is the deepest possible ‚Äúpanpsychist‚Äù perspective, is not contradicted by any known scientific phenomena. Also, unlike most emergentist positions, it is inclusive of the inextricable linkage between observer and observed, subject and object, decisively revealed by quantum mechanics. Indeed, at all levels of scale above the quantum realm, quantum-like effects ‚Äì such as uncertainty, complementarity, superposition, entanglement, non-locality - reflecting such interconnectivity are recognized. Corollaries of Non-Dual Conscious Realism include that: materiality is not implicit in the universe, but is entirely a scale dependent phenomenon; the ‚Äúhard problem‚Äù of qualia is subsumed by confirmation that all phenomena of the universe are qualia within consciousness; neural correlates of\nconsciousness are not how consciousness is created, but are, rather, the ways in which the nervous systems (human or other) transduce consciousness into adaptive, species-specific perceptions and behaviors. Individual consciousness and associated qualia are part of the universal, non-dual conscious reality.\n\nNeil Theise, MD\nProfessor of Pathology and of Medicine at Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai\nNeil Theise, MD is a practicing pathologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, where he is Professor of Pathology and of Medicine.

What does the evidence show? If we examine children who remember previous lives and provide details that have been corroborated, accounts of near death experiences, mediums who speak with spirits, the experience of ghost hunters, shamanic practitioners, and the perceptions of enlightened masters, then the simplest conclusion is that our consciousness survives physical death, and existed before birth. If true, this means that our consciousness is not dependent upon a physical brain, and in fact is not dependent at all on the physical world. This implies that consciousness is more fundamental than any physical manifestation, and thus can‚Äôt be described in terms of quantum mechanical wave functions, the zero point field, entangled particles, or any other entity subject to the equations of physics. If true, then there must exist a reality that lies beyond the physical world that our awareness goes to after physical death. In fact, this reality, and consciousness itself, has been explored for thousands of years with subjective techniques such as meditation, inquiry, shamanic journeying, and the use of entheogens such as peyote, mushrooms or ayahuasca. The fundamental question for this conference then changes from ‚Äúhow does the brain generate consciousness‚Äù to ‚Äúhow does our body and brain interface with consciousness?‚Äù Does the randomness inherent in quantum mechanics allow consciousness to affect the physical world?

A deeply rooted stillness and substratum. From the depths of spaceless space, pure potentiality blooms into form and function animated by deep relaxation. It maintains itself with pure strength in a creative tension. As it is all powerful, it can infinitely relax and contract, infinitely weave and return to formlessness. This is its play. A relaxed mind can celebrate the breadth of life and see the intelligence, creativity and mischief. A worried mind cannot but arc between enjoying and suffering. So, our first act of compassion is to show the mind its uncontained naturalness, so it can enjoy the View. This takes no time, as the Mind is already free, loyally pretending to be a small stressed servant rather than the supreme intelligence. Like a golden eagle freed from too small a cage, the mind can soar and explore with graceful curiosity all of creation and the space that holds everything. There is such a delight in looking into the Known and finding a shape shifting all creative deathless intelligence.

Chris Fields","description":"Entanglement or non-separability is the core idea of quantum theory. It is a simple idea: the universe is not a bunch of independent parts, but is rather one entity that evolves through time as one entity. That's it. The problem is that this means there's no such thing as causation. This is very hard to wrap your head around. Quantum theory is extraordinarily accurate, and our knowing quantum theory is why we have things like cell phones and computers. But what is quantum theory, really? Why is entanglement its primary prediction? This talk will explain what quantum theory is. I will show that quantum theory has nothing to do with tiny particles, wave-function collapse, or Schroedinger's cat. Quantum theory is about how observers obtain information about the world. It is, in particular, about how observers who have memories and use language obtain information about the world. It is, in other words, about how you and I interact with perfectly ordinary things like tables and chairs and each other. You will leave this talk with a new understanding of quantum theory, and a new appreciation for entanglement.\n\nChris Fields is an interdisciplinary information scientist interested in both the physics and the cognitive neuroscience underlying the human perception of objects as spatially and temporally bounded entities. His current research focuses on deriving quantum theory from classical information theory; he also works on cell-cell communication and cellular information processing, the role of the ‚Äúunconscious mind‚Äù in creative problem solving, and early childhood development, particularly the etiology of autism-spectrum conditions.  He and his wife, author and yoga teacher Alison Tinsley, recently published Meditation: If You‚Äôre Doing It, You‚Äôre Doing It Right, in which they explore the experience of meditation with meditators from many walks of life.\n\nDr. Fields has also been a volunteer firefighter, a visual artist, and a travel writer.

If correct, what we see in front of our nose is not the real external world, nor even a mental representation of it, but rather an accommodation to external stimulation expressed in our private space-object vocabulary. The capabilities of our mental display and its vocabulary are limited by our evolutionary development and so is the world we believe to be living in. The very stake-your-life-on-it reality we live and die by will change as our mental capability evolves.\n\nI will show how the psychological feeling of one-ness with the universe is actually an internal experience produced by an awareness of ones internal accommodation-model. This model includes both ones body and what are normally taken to be external objects. I will\nargue that the feelings of love and harmony associated with one-ness are due to the recognition that even ones enemies are in fact only characters who are part of us and play their threatening roles for our own good.\n\nI will show that one cannot logically become aware of anything outside ourselves and that the architecture of quantum theory describes the thought process of a conscious being. Entanglement is therefore largely attributed to the one-ness of our internal structure and the collapse of the wave function akin to the collapse of our knowledge of alternative possibilities when a measurement reveals the actuality of a situation. Knowing that this observer knowledge interpretation of quantum theory is discredited I will show that Bell‚Äôs theorem cannot be violated by any recorded measurement result and a flaw in the interpretation of the Aspect experiments is responsible for the popular opinion.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvtDV6aOnDw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvtDV6aOnDw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvtDV6aOnDw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvtDV6aOnDw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvtDV6aOnDw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":759,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gvtDV6aOnDw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dlHbnNDAykZ56bIr0jU4u1t6tMc","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjFwQkNzSEhObGln","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-02-26T03:41:11Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Five Elements Practices, Geshe Chaphur Rinpoche","description":"The Five Elements are an integral part of Tibetan cosmology and essential to understanding the relatedness and interdependence of all things in the universe.  e Five Elements (space/ether, earth, water,  re, and air) are the essential elements or building blocks for all phenomena, not only in the physical universe but also in our physical and energetic bodies. Each element represents not only an energetic quality, but also takes physical form‚Äîand like all forms, each element exists separately but also exists interdependently. Each element needs, supports, and affects the other elements together providing a cohesive whole within an individual being. When the Five Elements are out of balance, illness, negative emotions and disharmony manifest. The Five Elements practices from the B√∂n lineage of Tibetan Buddhism are spiritual practices that help to remove physical, mental, and energetic blocks.  e practices invoke, balance, and harmonize each of the  ve elements through the use of sacred seed syllables, mudras (hand movements), mantras (sacred chants), physical postures, breath work and visualizations. When practiced regularly, these practices help one to attain a healthier lifestyle and to improve one‚Äôs physical, mental and emotional health.\n\nInvoking space clears a cluttered mind and creates spaciousness and recognition of the pure space of being; invoking air transforms pride to peacefulness and helps to support increased flexibility and improved communication; invoking  re transforms greed and desire to generosity and supports increased creativity; invoking water transforms jealousy to openness and supports a peaceful presence; invoking earth transforms ignorance to wisdom and supports a grounding, abiding presence. Chaphur Rinpoche will brie y explain the purpose and qualities of each element and then guide participants in performing the Five Elements practices.\n\n\nGeshe Chaphur Rinpoche is the founder and spiritual director of Gyalshen Institute, an organization dedicated to the preservation and revival of the Zhang Zhung and Tibetan culture and traditions. He travels extensively providing teachings on B√∂n spiritual practices and has many on-going projects involving the preservation, translation, public presentation, and scholarly assessment of sacred B√∂n texts. Born in Amdo Ngaba in Eastern Tibet, he is from the Chaphur lineage, one of the oldest and most important lama family lineages within Tibet, and one of six principal high lama lineages within the Amdo region affiliated with Nangzhig Monastery. At age 16, under perilous conditions, he left Tibet and traveled many days on foot, through Tibet, Nepal and India in order to study at the B√∂n Dialectical School at Menri Monastery, the principal monastery for the B√∂n tradition in exile located in Dolanji, India.

This derivation is based on the fundamental existence of a uni ed reality. In this uni ed reality, the entanglement of systems in the physical world is a very natural and ubiquitous consequence.\n\nWe begin with the following postulate: there is one unifed entity in existence (Self), which perceives the world (itSelf) through localized perspectives, individually, one at a time. After restating that postulate in more physical terms, we arrive at both of the initial\npostulates for special relativity (relativity of physical law, constancy of the speed of light), as well as a fundamental property of quantum mechanics known as the single-framework rule. From this model, we discover that light exists in a timeless and spaceless state. This result  fits very nicely with the phenomenon of entanglement. Far more than an abstract concept applied only to experiments in a physicist‚Äôs lab, entanglement is a property of the\nuniverse providing connection across time and space that may have implications for everyday life. One such suggested implication is the phenomenon of synchronicity.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cR51H0fMJHM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cR51H0fMJHM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cR51H0fMJHM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cR51H0fMJHM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cR51H0fMJHM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":761,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cR51H0fMJHM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yD9Pn0ywQcuTI1TNMzbicLfL68o","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmFqZ2hpdlp2cXNn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-02-17T23:51:08Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Tangled Up in ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù, Chuck Hillig","description":"Whenever ego becomes entangled in a storyline through identification, it spontaneously manifests in the dream world as a separated ‚Äúyou.‚Äù Ego maintains this ongoing illusion of ‚Äúperson-hood‚Äù by holding that its dramatic story is being both sourced by and experienced through an imaginary ‚Äúavatar.‚Äù As such, ego believes itself to be the Thinker-of-its-thoughts, the Feeler-of-its-feelings, the Speaker-of-its-words, and the ‚ÄúDo-er‚Äù-of-its-actions.\nBut, nonduality holds that Consciousness, Itself, is only One, and that ‚ÄúIT‚Äù is really the true source and cause of everything.

Might be the way you have always thought about your mom, or the way you learned to scratch your nose. Physical and mental habits constrain our behavior, until we become aware of them, and\nhow they serve us, so that we can be free to choose them or not. The process of awareness can arise from a variety of experiences: moving, you discover what you did in another place that doesn't seem to make sense here; starting a new relationship, gives you a chance\nto see yourself afresh. Any place of change can be an opportunity to discover something about yourself. Focusing on body sensations and actions can be a powerful pathway in this journey. Each moment our body is entangled with a new now, of which we are part of. Each moment is a possibility of self awareness. Learning to improvise is learning to be present to each moment with its unique combination of world \"stuff\", allow yourself to be the \"stuff\", without knowing what it will become in the next moment. What happens to our brain when we do that? Brains are thought to be making predictions about the world\nall the time, maximizing rewards and minimizing harm, while at the same time looking at the discrepancy between the prediction and the actual event (prediction error), so that we can even better maximize reward and minimize harm. What happens when you are open to the unknown of the future, focused only on the present. How is the brain NOT making a prediction? How can the human NOT care about maximizing reward and minimizing harm? Are these two sides of the same coin? \n\nRita is constantly curious of the place were you can lose yourself into the Self.

Both practices are essentially quite similar in that they are both encouraging the practitioner to rest and abide in a felt sense of presence here and now. The touching into this sense of presence is the \"practice\". The dawning experiential seeing or direct understanding of the fact that this presence has always been present is the \"realization\" that is possible. This could be called either \"God-realization\" or \"Self-realization\", but I feel both terms are pointing to essentially the same realization of the absolute.\n\nEven though essentially quite similar, the two practices can often have a somewhat different \"tone\" to them. The Atma Vichara practice is imbued with a sharp and precise spirit of deep investigation while the contemplative prayer approach has a decidedly devotional or bhakti aspect, which I feel adds a dimension of power to the basic idea of looking at pure consciousness itself, which is really the essence of both practices. Contemplative prayer, rather than simply understood as object-less or non-conceptual awareness, aware of itself, is awareness LOVINGINGLY aware of itself. The author of \"The Cloud\" calls this a resting in the \"blind (non-conceptual) stirring of love\". I think a kind of blending of these two practices could possibly provide a creative synergy that has the potential to accelerate the\npossible effects of the practices by taking the discriminating spirit of profound investigation as found in the Traditional practice of Atma Vichara and combining it with the predominant devotional aspect found in the traditional practice of contemplative prayer.\n\nFrancis Bennett was a Roman Catholic, Trappist monk for a number of years. He lived in two monasteries of the Trappist Order in the US and was also a member of an urban, contemplative monastic community originally founded in Paris, France in 1975. He has lived in France at several monasteries, and in Canada at a small monastic community in Montreal Quebec. He received a five and a half year monastic/spiritual formation with the Trappists before he made his vows as a monk at Gethsemani Abbey in 1983. He graduated from the Pontifical College Josephinum with a BA in Philosophy and completed a two year residency in Clinical Pastoral Education with Ohio Health Hospital System in Columbus, Ohio. He has worked in ministry in the area of spiritual Care in the hospice movement, as a hospital chaplain and in spiritual care of the sick and dying in parish settings. He has lead retreats in both the Vipassana Buddhist Tradition and in the Christian mystical/contemplative Tradition. In 2010, while in the middle of a Church Service in his monastery in Montreal, Francis suddenly experienced what he has come to call, ‚Äúa radical perceptual shift in consciousness‚Äù, in which he discovered the ever present presence of spacious, pure awareness. He came to see that this awareness is actually the unchanging essence of who he really is and always has been; the Supreme Self, talked about by many sages and saints from many spiritual traditions down through the ages. He also came to see simultaneously, that this vast, infinite sense of presence at the center of his being (and at the center of the being of everyone else on the planet) is actually not at all separate from the presence of God, which he had been looking for during his many years as a monk and spiritual seeker.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RIxf2qMW2tw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RIxf2qMW2tw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RIxf2qMW2tw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RIxf2qMW2tw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RIxf2qMW2tw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":767,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RIxf2qMW2tw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NvViQpIOtQ3ONqbUXlPHn15p3To","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkN6SnhRYVBoWU5J","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-02-09T20:13:51Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Duality and Non-Duality of Quantum Mechanics and the Entanglement of Life","description":"How can the dualities of quantum mechanics (QM) nurture our entanglement with others and with nature. I take the dualities seriously. In fact my California license plate since 1977 has been DUALITY. The chief QM duality is the subjective/objective, or I - It split. Having a QM duality is much better than classical mechanics without the need for the subjective. The beauty of the QM cut that separates the two dualistic view is that it is more like an I-Thou, Buber-like entanglement, but not in the way most people think. For me the jump from duality to non-duality is two-fold. First, because of the way entanglements work, the I-It split is movable. Second, because of the more than 20 interpretations of QM, all of which give identical predicted probabilities, we can jump around from ontology to ontology in a marvelous non-duality manner.\n\nStanley Klein, Ph.D.Professor of Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley where he studies the visual system of humans, gathering empirical data and developing models for explaining the data.

Some non-local experiences have a more personal feel to them such as the knowledge of a loved one‚Äôs passing, linked consciousness in twins, synchronicity, and some other paranormal phenomena. Other non-local experiences have a more transpersonal feel to them such as healing at a distance, out-of-the-body experiences involving shamanic journeys to other worlds, and interactions with subtle beings sometimes involving a merging of the local self with a non-local entity or higher self. And in some cases non-local experiences are clearly linked to spiritual awakening. For example, in the secret spiritual autobiography of the famous Buddhist adept Jigme Lingpa, who lived in 18th century Tibet, there are descriptions of Lingpa‚Äôs non-local experiences that he says were essential for his awakening. It is this class of essential non-local spiritual experiences that will be the central focus of this presentation. There is currently a very lively debate whether non-local human experiences might in some way be related to the entanglement experimentally observed in quantum systems. According to Schr√∂dinger, entanglement is a characteristic of a quantum system where two energetic particles that once were in contact, and then are later separated, will remain connected in such a manner that the quantum state of one cannot be completely described without considering the other. The correspondences between non-locality in quantum systems and in exceptional states of consciousness are intriguing and are certainly worth investigating from theoretical, experimental, and experiential perspectives. \n\nFrank Echenhofer is a Professor Clinical Psychology at CIIS.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wqQgNdRnjg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wqQgNdRnjg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wqQgNdRnjg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wqQgNdRnjg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wqQgNdRnjg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":769,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2wqQgNdRnjg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"r_a4nNb4-otzfbqZI2neX9e_lKc","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjltN0JxU0U4UEFv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-29T22:21:55Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Oneness Beyond Belief, Unmani","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nThere is a big difference between believing or thinking that we are all connected or entangled, and actually knowing it for yourself in your own direct knowing.

We meet ‚Äòas if‚Äô we are separate, but really truly we always know that there is never any possibility of separation, or in fact of being connected. Beyond all the thinking and imagining, I am you. I always have been.\n\nUnmani points very directly to who you really are beyond all the words and concepts. If there is a readiness to hear this, then there is a possibility to investigate the reality of everything that you have ever believed in. Realizing more and more that your whole life is based on an assumption of who you think you are, there is a total freefall into not knowing. Unmani travels around the world offering spontaneous and uncompromising nondual Meetings and Retreats in ‚ÄòNot-Knowing‚Äô. These Retreats have an intensely intimate flavor as Unmani invites you to wake up to the way it actually is beyond all your hopes and fears. In having a dialogue with Unmani there is no escape from the unknowable reality of life.\n\nUnmani is the author of two books I am Life itself and Die to Love and is now writing a third book.\n\nhttp://www.die-to-love.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9m7BqSE8PAo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9m7BqSE8PAo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9m7BqSE8PAo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9m7BqSE8PAo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9m7BqSE8PAo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":770,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9m7BqSE8PAo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZEEfJIG1usILV6IwW0pBxpcoux8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lll3NTVCc1RvVlpN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-29T20:27:46Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Robert Lanza: The Theory of Biocentrism,  Part 2","description":"This is Part 2 of Robert Lanza's talk on Biocentrism at the Science and Nonduality Conference 2010. \n\nhttp://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nWatch Part 1 here: http://youtu.be/zI_F4nOKDSM\n\nThe mission of Science and Nonduality (SAND) is to forge a new paradigm in spirituality, one that is not dictated by religious dogma, but rather is based on timeless wisdom traditions of the world, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yw55BsToVZM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yw55BsToVZM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yw55BsToVZM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yw55BsToVZM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":771,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Yw55BsToVZM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EwjM8RKn-nuxbH4KuzS-Q227WzA","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmNncVhYcUFVN0lF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-28T01:33:02Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Panel - Using Entheogens on the Spiritual Path","description":"A panel with Bob Jesse, Tom Pinkson, Merrill Ward with Lyn Hunstad as a moderator.\n\nThis panel discussion will explore how entheogens can be an aid on the spiritual path and to help you evaluate if this work is appropriate for you.

Whilst this realization is undoubtedly a profoundly transformative experience, living this truth is more of a challenge. It seems that awakening is just the beginning: the embodiment of this awakening is the real journey. The adventure begins, not in the rarified atmosphere of transcendence, but in the midst of the turbulence of life. As awakening descends from mind to heart to body, we are called into an uncompromising embracement of both the ocean of inner stillness and the waves of phenomenal expression. One of the most frequent questions on the spiritual path is ‚ÄúHow can we wholeheartedly meet the world without getting lost in it?‚Äù In other words, ‚ÄúHow can we embrace the mystery and mess of the human experience without getting entangled in it?‚Äù\n\nThe capacity of impersonal awakeness to be deeply intimate with what is, is a beautiful paradox of nondual awareness. A whole new dimension of spiritual maturity opens up to us when we recognize that absolute and relative are one, as inseparable as the waves from the ocean. Deep intimacy with what is means that we fully meet - as a present-moment reality -everything that appears in our perceptual field. Everything - both dark and light, form and formless, mundane and transcendent - is seen to be an expression of oneness, and so nothing is avoided, denied or feared. When you deeply accept that every experience is an invitation from the beloved, calling you to abandon yourself into the moment, that which is awake in you as love meets itself in everything and gives birth to a radically new way of living.\n\nAmoda Maa offers a gentle yet uncompromising pointer to authentic freedom. Her teaching ‚Äì which is free of all dogma, ideology or tradition ‚Äì has evolved out a direct experience of awakened presence amidst the depths of personal suffering. Having taken many years for this nod-dual awareness to integrate into ordinary life, today she offers satsangs and retreats to a growing global community. Her invitation is into the untamable fire of truth and to live the luminosity of this truth amidst the mystery and mess of human existence.\n\nAmoda Maa is the author of How to Find God in Everything and Change Your Life, Change Your World, and is currently working on a third book called Radical Awakening. She is also the founder of the ‚ÄòFoundation for Conscious Change‚Äô, a non-profit organization that supports her teaching.\n\nhttp://www.amodamaa.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zE2A1KEQ_lo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zE2A1KEQ_lo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zE2A1KEQ_lo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zE2A1KEQ_lo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zE2A1KEQ_lo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":773,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zE2A1KEQ_lo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"UlsngwhD5Oof8W6baStAw8eUIBQ","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmhoX212YkFVdUN3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-23T19:54:24Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Cerebrospinal Fluid and the Appearance of ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù,  Mauro Zappaterra","description":"To learn more at the junction of medicine, neuroscience and nonduality, visit the SAND Website! https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/ \n\nCertain traditions believe there is a ‚Äòstep-down‚Äô process or condensation that occurs from the Source to our physical self. As this energy condenses it becomes more differentiated and visible to the human eye as physical form. As this condensation occurs, certain traditions believe that the initial ‚Äòstep‚Äô into the body occurs at the third eye, or the brow center.\n\nAt this same location is the third ventricle, a space in the middle of the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As the energy from the Source condenses into physical form, the ‚Äòstep‚Äô into the physical body may be into this fluid that bathes the entire inner and outer surface of the brain and spinal cord. Nisargadatta Maharaj said, ‚Äúfluids come together and the ‚ÄòI Am‚Äô appears.‚Äù The CSF may be the fluid through which the ‚ÄòI Am‚Äô appears. The CSF is a conveyor of energy. An adult produces 500ml of CSF daily. While the CSF is 99% water, the CSF is also rich in proteins, ions, lipids, hormones, cholesterol, glucose, and many other molecules. The CSF is home to many neurotransmitters and signaling molecules providing an elaborate range of biological functions. The CSF utilizes volume transmission and its components can potentially be dispersed quickly and target key brain regulatory centers simultaneously due to its fluid nature. Moreover, along the third ventricle, the pineal gland makes direct contact with the CSF, and releases information directly into the CSF for volume transmission to the rest of the brain. In addition, the CSF contains the ‚Äòspirit molecule‚Äô DMT that is released by the pineal gland.  Therefore, the CSF may serve as a vehicle for immediate signaling to major control centers of the brain and may be significant in regulating consciousness and the sense of ‚ÄòI Am‚Äô.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh_mvbAUuCw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh_mvbAUuCw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh_mvbAUuCw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh_mvbAUuCw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh_mvbAUuCw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":774,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hh_mvbAUuCw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6BT1-XRSK9ZJ1E-h8swYQZH64aw","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lk83TzRJR2dMOE5n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-23T19:53:14Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Meditation and Intimacy, Shauna Shapiro","description":"Enlightenment is intimacy with all things says Suzuki Roshi.

The body is also a window to the depth of one‚Äôs human life and carries forward all of one‚Äôs experience, from infancy through to adulthood. The notion of truth pursued is the cornerstone for this examination of the effects of infant neglect, which has been unwittingly promoted in our culture over the last 90 years. Early trauma is not always visible, coherent, or easily described. This presentation will explore infant trauma due to neglect and provide an understanding of the psychobiological, depth psychological, and spiritual implications it can have on an individual, consciousness, and the culture as a whole.\n\nTrauma is a living, dynamic phenomenon embedded in people‚Äôs everyday activities, encounters, and exchanges. It is experienced as regressing and advancing in a series of entanglements, multiple temporalities, selves, and environments. In each reverberation of neglect lies evidence for the infant that the world is unsafe and life threatening; the infant seeks escape where there is no escape. This takes the form of dissociation and a split of the psyche. The consequences are vast, including structures of defense that are difficult to unearth, a compromised immune system, and a distressing state living in the psyche that may explode or implode at any time. However, trauma has been shown to be regenerative; through embodied healing one can reconnect to one‚Äôs authentic aliveness and wholeness, whereby a profound compassion emerges, which has the ability to hold the complexity of the human experience. The traumas one endures and resolves within the body/mind seem to be a crucial part of opening to deeper levels of compassion while dissolving psychological conditioning, and awakening the spiritual heart which has the capacity to know the Absolute in its entirety.\n\nJulie Brown Yau‚Äôs diverse 28-year background in psychological, somatic, and spiritual traditions provides her with a unique depth of knowledge and direct experience. She holds master‚Äôs degrees in spiritual psychology and depth psychology and is currently working toward her doctoral degree. Julie‚Äôs work is inspired by ancient wisdom, neurobiology, and the importance of embodiment to know the full vitality of life. Embodiment is crucial for maintaining Spiritual insights. Julie teaches somatic and contemplative practices, she also has a private practice in Laguna Beach CA. She specializes in Somatic Experiencing and NARM (NeuroAffective Relational Model) in the resolution of trauma. She also supports those who are actively dying to awaken to the multilevel cosmos. Julie assists both her students and patients to open to deeper dimensions within the body/mind and the living universe to experience authentic vibrancy and joy.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/To-kV9bECgg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/To-kV9bECgg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/To-kV9bECgg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/To-kV9bECgg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/To-kV9bECgg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":777,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"To-kV9bECgg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"08x_EMj1JxVVVrNxntydiH0RDFk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lm1laHhiNFc0MTlF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-01-22T01:39:06Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Second Axial Bodies, Rev. Matthew Wright","description":"Recorded at Science and Nonduality Conference http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nMany thinkers today believe we are entering a ‚ÄúSecond Axial Age‚Äù‚Äîa great shift in consciousness and spirituality equal to that which produced the headwaters of our great religious traditions between roughly 800-200 BCE. This shift is related closely to the process of globalization, and our emerging sense of oneness‚Äîwe are one human family, one planetary body, one intricately interwoven tapestry of life. \n\nWhile the First Axial Age opened for us the possibility of the transcendent and a personal quest for enlightenment or salvation, it also tended to break our earlier, primal sense of collective identity (rooted in tribe) and our deep, felt connection to Earth. In this next shift, we are picking that earlier sensibility back up, not at the tribal, but at the global level. In the process, our religions are being transformed. \n\nRather than being called to step into decline and death, however, they are being asked to offer their practices of devotion and transformation in the shared service of our collective awakening. The blessings, spiritual treasures, and ‚Äúmystical bodies‚Äù of our great religions hold the tools needed to carry us into this next phase of spiritual evolution. They will only flow forward, however, when freed from the exclusivist identities and superiority complexes that have plagued their histories and that do violence to the single human body we are in the process of becoming. \n\nProfound interspiritual permeability will characterize the next phase of religious understanding. Each tradition will have a vital body of practice to continue in the service of the human body. What will this look like for individual traditions? How do independent religious\nbodies begin to interrelate and evolve? Exploring Christianity as an example, we will work with key thinkers such as Teilhard de Chardin, Bede Griffiths, and Raimon Panikkar.\n\nThe Rev. Matthew Wright is an Episcopal priest working to renew the Christian Wisdom tradition within a wider interspiritual framework.  Alongside his practice of Christianity, he draws deeply from the sacred worlds of Islamic Sufism and Vedanta.

In other words distance is not a factor in the transfer and mutual influence of information. This discovery has important implications for human relationships. Although more a metaphor than a proven correlation, it is interesting to note how the principle has parallels in terms of the deep spiritual conditions beyond the time space continuum that can impact experiences within the relational field. We will be investigating how entanglement can be seen as an expression of a kind of union between beings that is more intimate than simply being connected or not separate. How will two people experience this principle within their relationship? What are the implications of this kind of union? What kinds of potential does entanglement speak to that are inherent in our relationships? What does it mean about love, intimacy, delight and pleasure? I posit that it calls into question how we hold these human experiences. We can find that there is more to relationships than we have usually imagined.  at our usual limited ways of experiencing, no matter how pleasurable or fulfilling; there is more mystery to them in ways that we might not have considered before.The presentation is a contemplation of how nonlocal entanglement can manifest itself in relationships.\n\nKaren Johnson participated in the development of the Diamond\nApproach with Hameed Ali since 1970‚Äôs, She has been teaching in the US and Europe for 35 years.

Moderated by Gail Brenner, Ph.D\n\nThe conscious realization of our true nature reveals that who we are is pure being, the source of life that is at the heart of everything. We know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that\nwe are not the separate, limited self de ned by beliefs, habits, stories, and identifications. Yet, this idea of ourselves‚Äîand the conditioning that supports it‚Äîlies deeply embedded in our minds, emotions, and bodies, and for most truth lovers, takes time to unwind. Even after awakening, these patterns continue to play out, despite our best intentions to notice them before they take hold. Traditionally, psychotherapy has offered a forum to help people ease their suffering. But offered from a conventional perspective, it is necessarily limited because it fails to directly explore the actual root of the problem‚Äîthe identification as a separate person. Psychotherapy with a therapist who understands how we mistakenly identify as the separate \"I\" holds much potential to support and deepen awakening. Guided to see through attachment to stories and identify ways we resist what arises, we are offered the invitation to continually fall into the recognition of pure presence. Our panel of experienced practitioners will discuss how they work with trauma, emotions, conditioned habits, entrenched belief systems, and the body to facilitate releasing the identification as separate and living the realization of our true nature as ever-present, free of history, and infinitely at peace.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPj21NgFapM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPj21NgFapM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPj21NgFapM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPj21NgFapM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPj21NgFapM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":785,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LPj21NgFapM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"b9e6c-grZ0myL6NJ6Zx8ZISYDNk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnVFdmdXWEE1d3Fv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-12-27T01:43:55Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Quantum Physics and Romanesque Art - Lothar Sch√§fer, Ph.D.","description":"Deep Truths Are Eternal.

The discovery of Quantum Physics that there is an invisible part of the world, which doesn't consist of things, but of non-material forms, is such a truth. We find it, for example, in the\nwork of the European Romanesque Artists, between 1000 ‚Äì 1120 CE. the artists at that time believed that the basis of reality is an invisible mystery, and they wanted to reveal that mystery in their art. In this lecture the parallels between the world view of Quantum Physics and that of the Romanesque Artists will be described, which suggest that our mind is connected with a Cosmic Mind, which expresses its principles as thoughts in our mind and as material structures in the external world.\n\nLothar Sch√§fer is Distinguished Professor (emeritus) of Physical Chemistry at the University of Arkansas.

I evaluate this assumption, using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms that study perceptual evolution, and find that it is almost surely false. Our perceptions of space-time and objects are a species-specific adaptation, not an insight into objective reality. In consequence, I propose a formal theory of consciousness‚Äîthe theory of ‚Äúconscious agents‚Äù‚Äîthat takes consciousness to be fundamental, rather than derivative from objects in space-time. I use the theory of conscious\nagents to solve the combination problem of consciousness, both for the combination of subjects and of experiences. I show that entanglement follows as a consequence of the combination of conscious subjects. I then discuss the relationship of these findings to the account of entanglement given by quantum-Bayesian interpretations of quantum theory.\n\nDonald Hoffman, Ph.D.Cognitive Scientist and Author, Department of CognitiveSciences, U.C.

These two questions have remained unanswered since the beginning of the human race. Science has made tremendous progress in understanding physical reality, but consciousness has remained largely a mystery. In human experience, reality has an inner, subjective aspect, and an outer, objective aspect, yet science insists in a materialistic position where everything in the universe, including consciousness, is supposed to derive from matter. For science, then, only outer reality exists, and inner reality must therefore be an epiphenomenon.\n\nFor the last 400 years, western culture has lived suspended between a Cartesian mindbody dualism and a monism based on scientific materialism. On the other hand, for more than 4000 years, many eastern spiritual traditions have held that consciousness is fundamental, and physical reality derives from it. How can we resolve this debate and find unity between inner and outer realities?\n\nIn this presentation, I will describe my attempt at unification with a hypothesis that starts where the eastern traditions leave off, and weaves a narrative that is intended as a first step toward uniting science and spirituality. This narrative is intended to create a conceptual framework for a future mathematical theory of consciousness, where consciousness is held as a primary property of nature. This hypothesis starts by postulating that the fundamental energy of which space, time and matter are made contains also the seeds of consciousness, therefore the evolution of our universe is in reality a co-evolution of consciousness and matter. This co-evolution is driven by the desire of consciousness to know itself, and matter serves as a kind of mirror to help consciousness do so. Thus, the complexity of living matter reflects the self-knowing of consciousness.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5REKKkKZpY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5REKKkKZpY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5REKKkKZpY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5REKKkKZpY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K5REKKkKZpY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":788,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"K5REKKkKZpY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vt1f-_WVsKOwOTzNhbeSpP527bU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnF1ZnlZNEpIVTRN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-12-27T01:36:28Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Scientific Views and Meaning of Entanglement","description":"A panel discussion with Henry Stapp, Federico\nFaggin, Neil Theise; moderated by Menas Kafatos.\n\nEntanglement has a well-understood meaning in quantum mechanics.

We are also endowed with the wisdom to recognize the nourishment and pass over the noxious weeds.\n\nWhen we encounter different faiths, our task is to excavate and sift to find the jewels that lie at the heart of each tradition. Every religion contains a treasure trove of wisdom teachings and transformational practices, and each one is also burdened with divisive messages and a history of violence and oppression. The inter-spiritual seeker dares to dive down and lift up the teachings of love, and refuse to drink the poison.\n\nThe emerging inter-spiritual movement does not insist that all the world‚Äôs religions are the same. Rather, it affirms that all the world‚Äôs religions recognize and proclaim that all beings are one. It is in this sense that the inter-spiritual path is unifying.\n\nThe goal of the inter-spiritual life is to move beyond inter-religious dialog and into a direct experience of the sacred in multiple traditions‚Äîan encounter that, by its very nature, dissolves historical boundaries and calls all beings into our essential interconnected state. By cultivating radical spiritual nakedness, we transcend theology and enter the mystery, where we may be transformed by love.\n\nIn this session, we will follow the streams of mystical longing and social justice that emanate from and return to the heart of the world‚Äôs religious traditions. Through readings from the ecstatic poetry of the mystics, sitting in contemplative silence, chanting the names of God in an array of languages, and engaging in deep dialog, we build community and invigorate our inter-spiritual quest, so that we may live in deeper peace and be of greater service to all beings.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4YOpuAt-8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4YOpuAt-8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4YOpuAt-8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4YOpuAt-8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd4YOpuAt-8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":792,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"cd4YOpuAt-8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"j5x7bwkOxZ72fMLzmxITrmRjgbM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnF6Z2psS0RtU2VJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-12-11T03:39:43Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"What Can Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Teach us About The Brain, Mind, And Self? - Rudolph Tanzi","description":"Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is the most common form of dementia affecting the elderly and is characterized by global cognitive decline in learning, memory, reasoning and judgment. AD is strongly influenced by both genetic factors and lifestyle. While certain rare genemutations guarantee onset of AD before 60 years old, most cases of AD involve genetic susceptibility factors that interplay with each other as well as environmental factors and life exposures to determine life-long risk. Lifestyle factors include diet, levels of exercise, intellectual stimulation and social engagement, as well as sleep patterns.  The genetic and environmental factors contributing to risk for AD will be reviewed along with emerging therapeutic strategies for treating and preventing this devastating disease. In addition, the effects of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease on the brain, mind, and consciousness will be considered. In particular, the question of how the concept of ‚Äúself ‚Äúcan be further refined in view of the effects of Alzheimer‚Äôs on the brain and mind will be discussed.

But how do non-conscious mental processes interact with events that take place in time? By definition, we aren‚Äôt privy to our non-conscious minds, so to get at this question, we have to use some tricks. I will first briefly describe current neuroscientific and psychological ideas about how everyday conscious awareness creates a sense of order and temporal flow. Then we will delve into the methods used to examine how non-conscious processes interact with events, and how the results of such experiments can inform our understanding about the nature of reality and time. Specifically, I will describe the methods and implications of experiments examining non-conscious ‚Äútime bending‚Äù (i.e., differences between our everyday conscious version of time and the versions accessed by non-conscious processes), including presentiment/precognition experiments and their implications. Finally, I will discuss a new model describing how the so-called past, present, and future collapse under the influence non-conscious processing. Taken from another point of view, this model also addresses how the past, present, and future are manufactured for use by everyday conscious processes.\n\nJulia Mossbridge is a Staff Scientist and the Director of the Innovation Lab at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), the Science Director at Focus@Will Labs, and a Visiting Scholar in Psychology at Northwestern University.

It is outside of all previous articulations of the Diamond Approach. We are in uncharted territory. This new view, which I call the view of totality, reveals that the Diamond Approach cannot be mapped because reality itself cannot be captured in a map. Reality is not a monolithic, static truth that can be defined in a fixed way. It is actually way more alive and mysterious than that. We might feel chagrined by this if we believe that we have reached some final, eternal truth about reality; or we might feel delighted by the freedom of not having an end or a goal to reach.

It can take a heavy toll unless it is recognized and managed effectively and insightfully. Western medicine, in theory and practice, tends to treat mind and body as separate entities.  is separation, which has always gone against ancient human wisdom, has now been demonstrated by modern science to be not only artificial, but false.  e brain and body systems that process emotions are intimately connected with the hormonal apparatus, the nervous system, and in particular the immune system. Emotional stress, especially of the hidden kind that people are not aware of, undermines immunity, disrupts the body's physiological milieu and can prepare the ground for disease.  ere is strong evidence to suggest that in nearly all chronic conditions, from cancer, ALS, or multiple sclerosis to autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or Alzheimer's, hidden stress is a major predisposing factor. In an important sense, disease in an individual can be seen as the ‚Äúend point‚Äù of a multigenerational emotional process. If properly understood, these conditions can provide important openings for compassion and self-awareness, which in turn are major tools in recovery and healing.\n\nDr. Mat√©‚Äôs presentation includes research findings, compelling and poignant anecdotes from his own extensive experience in family practice and palliative care, and illuminating biographies of famous people such as athlete Lance Armstrong, the late comedienne Gilda Radner, or famed baseball legend Lou Gehrig.

Yet we are still trying to understand them in terms of a worldview that believes the real world to be that\nof space, time, and matter, and relegates consciousness to some artifact of brain processes.\n\nYet the one thing of which we are certain is that we are aware. And it is the one thing the current worldview cannot account for.  is profound anomaly will ultimately lead to the full paradigm shift to which contemporary physics is, unwittingly, pointing.\n\nWith consciousness as primary, everything remains the same and everything changes. Mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry are unchanged. What changes is our assumption as to what they are describing.  They are not describing the unfolding of a physical world, but the unfolding of a universal self-aware  eld. We are led to the conclusion that the entire cosmos is a vast  eld of knowing, knowing itself, and in that knowing creating for itself the appearance of a material world. Why then don't we see it that way? Why does the material world appear devoid of consciousness?\n\nFrom the deep pools of Eastern wisdom, to the fast-paced rapids of the West, Peter Russell has mastered many fields, and synthesized them with consummate artistry. Weaving his unique blend of scientific rationale, global vision, and intuitive wisdom, Peter brings a sharp, critical mind to the challenge of self-awakening. The next great frontier of human exploration, he shows, is not outer space, but inner space‚Äîthe development of the human mind.\n\nHe has degrees in theoretical physics, experimental psychology, and computer science from the University of Cambridge in England, and has written ten books in this area, including The Global Brain Awakens, Waking Up in Time, and most recently, From Science to God: A Physicist‚Äôs Journey into the Mystery of Consciousness.\n\nhttp://www.peterrussell.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g04RHQ1ysb4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g04RHQ1ysb4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g04RHQ1ysb4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g04RHQ1ysb4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g04RHQ1ysb4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":803,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"g04RHQ1ysb4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"nBGzuqFTAVe6mMsInTN_6XTtdQU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnY3M1M0QmtJdHJj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-11-18T18:16:20Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Panel: Quantum Theory and Free Will - Chris Fields, Henry Stapp & Donald Hoffman","description":"Quantum theory incorporates two seemingly-contradictory ideas about free will.

No one is \"looking at\" the universe as a whole - all observers are inside the universe by definition - so the time evolution of the whole universe must be perfectly deterministic.  This clash between indeterminism and determinism is sharpened by the existence of a strong theorem, the Conway-Kochen \"free will theorem,\" that says that if human (or any other kind of) observers are assumed to have free will, everything\nelse in the universe, even electrons, has to be assumed to have free will, too.

And even if they could mimic the interconnectedness of the neurons in the human brain, they would be hard-pressed to recreate actual human consciousness. For that, you would need a mechanism that connects you to the fundamental spacetime geometry of the universe.\n\nThis universal approach to consciousness depends, in large part, upon quantum mechanics. In classical physics, you see a separation between basic units like protons, neutrons and quarks. But when you view the universe through a quantum lens, the separation, the void, drops away.

Wheeler is a natural consequence of measurement theory in standard John von Neumann quantum view established more than 80 years ago. Recently, entanglement has been demonstrated in macroscopic diamond crystals, implying that non-trivial quantum e ects are not con ned to the microscopic realm. Quantum theory in its foundations implies a primary role for the mind and interactions of observers with objects under observation. Yet, despite these profound experimental results confirming quantum physics, neuroscience assigns mental activity to physical process and seeks explanations in neuronal connections and processes with no obvious role for the observer or agency implied by quantum physics. Although advancing our knowledge of correlates of conscious experience and yielding great medical advances, brain science through its fundamental physicalist assumptions has yielded little in the actual understanding of experience and mind.\n e emerging view proposed here is that entanglement, nonlocality and coherent structures are all manifestations of the universe which is basically living and conscious. Consciousness manifesting as awareness, of objects and the observing agent, is primary,\nrather than derived through blind processes as current materialist approaches claim. Entanglement is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanical phenomena at microscopic scales. It is instead the natural feature of the primacy of consciousness, operating through three fundamental principles of complementarity; creative interactivity and sentience; and recursion. The main issue is not how such the universe is nonlocal and entangled but rather how it appears as made of distinct, physical objects. What is proposed is that the mind creates a veiling of undivided wholeness. It is both the new and also ancient vision of non-duality, which we should pass on to the next generations.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRNcTr_KnZY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRNcTr_KnZY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRNcTr_KnZY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRNcTr_KnZY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRNcTr_KnZY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":807,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"fRNcTr_KnZY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"H-iB0BoQPGf-xEuf8EIEdtwZ3qw","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lm9pV1NsQzlWM0Mw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-11-16T01:56:04Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Opening Ceremony SAND14","description":"Opening Ceremony of SAND14 with the singer and activist Jennifer Johns followed by the opening remarks of Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo (SAND founders). \n\nhttp://www.scienceandnonduality.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiWSlC9V3C0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiWSlC9V3C0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiWSlC9V3C0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiWSlC9V3C0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oiWSlC9V3C0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":808,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oiWSlC9V3C0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WLLHgCVxGV8K7D6P_hkP-dZimjM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkJLck44dnFBQVZn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-11-14T19:20:04Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Science Meets Spirituality","description":"A Taste of Science and Nonduality Gathering http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\n‚ÄúThis is the place where big questions ‚ÄòWho am I?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat is life?‚Äô can be explored utilizing all lenses.‚Äù \n\n\"No question is off limits, every question is worth asking.\"\n\n‚ÄúIs there a basis for what we perceive in the manifest world as spiritual?

What kind of spiritual perception or insight parallels, or may account for, such property of entanglement? Is nondual perception sufficient to account for entanglement? Or do we need to look at another characteristic of consciousness - the fundamental spiritual element - to  find a realization that parallels the phenomena of entanglement, where there is no time or distance between objects or events? What is the experience of reality in such spiritual realization, and can it give us more insights about quantum entanglement?

Almaas","description":"Many people have experienced some form of realization, such as dissolution of or dis-identification with body or ego and are beginning to recognize themselves as awareness. However, a fully embodied, lived, and expressed realization is another step altogether, and many seekers experience difficulties bridging this gap. What does it take for our understanding to fully penetrate body and mind and to be lived as a permanent reality wholly expressed in the world? How do our ideas of what it means to live life from one's deepest realization get in the way of actually living it? Which difficulties do we encounter, which delusions and misunderstood ideas, and how do they limit realization itself? Are there useful descriptions of stages to realization, or do they actually hinder the spontaneous unfolding of presence?\n\nHameed Ali (A. H. Almaas) Ph.D., Founder of the Diamond Approach¬Æ  - a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Freedom is living our realization, a dynamic enlightenment where our transcendent nondual truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization. Almaas' books include: The Inner Journey Home, Essence, The Pearl Beyond Price, Luminous Night‚Äôs Journey, and The Unfolding Now. Almaas' latest book is Runaway realization.

His teachings are an open invitation to stop, inquire, and recognize what is true and liberating at the core of all existence. Asked to teach in 1996 by his Zen teacher of 14 years, Adyashanti offers teachings that are free of any tradition or ideology. ‚ÄúThe Truth I point to is not confined within any religious point of view, belief system, or doctrine, but is open to all and found within all.‚Äù He teaches throughout North America and Europe, offering satsangs, weekend intensives, silent retreats, and a live internet radio broadcast.

If separation is illusory, then any attempt to not be separate is rooted in a dualistic perspective. So the basic principle of any guidance which attempts to transform an illusory state of being separate into a state of at-oneness is based on the belief in a divided reality and cannot therefore claim to be non-dual.\n\nHowever, as long as oneness appears as a seeker with personal needs there will also arise a personal response and guidance from others together with a description of their approach to satisfying those needs. Teachings apparently happen together with recommendations and processes to help the seeker change or be more open to a better experience. This personal guidance assumes the existence of free will, choice and the ability and need to pursue a progressive path leading to personal fulfillment.\n\nThe open secret perception is that what is ultimately longed for cannot be taught, given, attained or known.\n\nThe view here is that the sense of seeming separate is an illusory state which drives the apparent seeker to search for another illusory state called enlightenment.

Perspectives from\nScience and Kashmir Shaivism, Maria Syldona, PhD\n\nMyriad questions remain unanswered about perception despite decades of scientific research in numerous fields from neuroscience to quantum physics. This leaves many accomplished scientists wondering why key discoveries have not yet been made. Perhaps it's attributable to science's inherently limited perspective on perception -- as a phenomenon relative only to the apparently external, objective world.\n\nKashmir Shaivism (Pure Trika System) is by definition the 'science of man and his world', and in addressing the mundane aspect of perception, potentially holds important keys to continuing scientific conundrums. The scope of the purpose of perception in Kashmir Shaivism is significantly broader than in science. Here perception is seen also as a means of active human evolutionary development that culminates in our living in the state of the Supreme Self as a human being -- our birthright. In addition, this evolutionary process promotes the development of intuitional perception ('direct perception') that produces the 'AHA' moments of creativity that enhance our professional and personal endeavors to make our world the peaceful paradise it was meant to be. Swami Laksman Joo, the last living master of Kashmir Shaivism, once said that the reason the universe exists is purely for our development. This statement implies an answer to yet another one of the major questions of science -- 'Why are we here'? Human psychospiritual development appears to be the reason for our time and experience here on earth.\n\nThis presentation spans contemporary scientific research in areas including perception and physics, and concepts in Kashmir Shaivism that either parallel those of science or which may point the way to other lucrative avenues for scientific inquiry. Experiential practice aspects of Kashmir Shaivism are also included, reflecting both the sound theoretical and practice arms for which Kashmir Shaivism is known.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaqEuOpnt34/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaqEuOpnt34/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaqEuOpnt34/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaqEuOpnt34/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaqEuOpnt34/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":841,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xaqEuOpnt34"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"wOWt1trPEXE-6g3eg6s4PvZUqs8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkxQaGdEZlQ0WnBj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-07-19T23:43:53Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Is Consciousness the Unified Field?, John Hagelin","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nProgress in theoretical physics during the past decade has led to a progressively more unified understanding of the laws of nature, culminating in the recent discovery of completely unified field theories based on the superstring. These theories identify a single universal, unified field at the basis of all forms and phenomena in the universe.\n\nAt the same time, cutting-edge research in the field of neuroscience has revealed the existence of a 'unified field of consciousness'‚Äîa fourth major state of human consciousness, which is physiologically and subjectively distinct from waking, dreaming and deep sleep. In this meditative state, a.k.a. Samadhi, the threefold structure of waking experience‚Äîthe observer, the observed and the process of observation‚Äîare united in one indivisible wholeness of pure consciousness.\n\nThese parallel discoveries of a unified field of physics and a unified field of consciousness raise fundamental questions concerning the relationship between the two. We present compelling theoretical and experimental evidence that the unified field of physics and the unified field of consciousness are identical‚Äîi.e., that during the meditative state, human awareness directly experiences the unified field at the foundation of the universe.\n\nWe show that the proposed identity between pure consciousness and the unified field may be required to account for experimentally observed 'field effects of consciousness.' We present the published results of a National Demonstration Project‚Äîin which 4,000 advanced meditators markedly reduced violent crime in Washington, DC. We briefly discuss mechanisms from quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and superstring theory that could explain the proposed link between human neurphysiology and the unified field of physics.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPhgDfT4Zpc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPhgDfT4Zpc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPhgDfT4Zpc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPhgDfT4Zpc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPhgDfT4Zpc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":842,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LPhgDfT4Zpc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mDXMI0xxEBANv-BPSPW5JWijL84","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LllMeGRZaGJOak9j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-07-15T05:33:15Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Entanglement of Life","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nEntanglement is one of the strangest parts of quantum mechanics ‚Äî so strange, in fact, that Albert Einstein famously referred to it as \"spooky action at a distance.\" An entangled system shows a property that has been measured for the whole but not for parts. For instance, we may know that the sum of the spins of a pair of two particles is zero, but neither of them is in a definite state (a condition referred to as superposition), particle until one is measured, causing the other particle to assume the opposite state. The effect is instantaneous, even if the two particles reside on opposite ends of the universe.\n\nCuriously, when science drills down into the core of even the most solid-looking object, separateness dissolves, and all that remain are relationships extending throughout, and possibly beyond, space and time, revealing a deeper reality which evokes what sages from all ages and traditions have been describing as one substance ‚Äî call it consciousness, call it energy ‚Äî comprising all the universe and giving rise to all appearances.\n\nWhen we begin to explore the fabric of reality either through the lens of science or through the lens of spirituality, a deeper understanding and experience of what we call reality emerges as infinite, ever present, interconnected whole.\n\n- What is the nature of the universe?\n- What is the nature of awareness that makes it possible for us to experience the universe?\n- Is there a scientifically viable way to explain consciousness?\n- What is the connection between consciousness and the phenomenon of entanglement?\n- Is our current scientific paradigm based on a subject/object split equipped to answer the bigger questions of    life?\n- Is there evidence of quantum entanglement on a macro scale?\n\nThese and many more questions will be explored at the next SAND14!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLxdYhbNjOc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLxdYhbNjOc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLxdYhbNjOc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLxdYhbNjOc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLxdYhbNjOc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":843,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YLxdYhbNjOc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"hkqvI6V2eC-tb6j5nBGbZW_UfLM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LlBlQ1pHOFNjZTd3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-07-10T20:50:24Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Stopping thought, Stopping Time, Gary Weber","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nRamesh Balsekar, Nisargadatta's translator, and a well-known non-dualist, said \" e core of our problem, then, lies in thought, which is the creator of time\". This opens a window into an approach for ending the tyranny of conceptual/mental time. If thought can be modified, slowed, or stopped, then time can be modified, slowed, or stopped. Following many years of yoga and meditation practice, the speaker, a PhD. in the physical sciences and an industrial and academic researcher and manager, had his self-referential thoughts abruptly stop.  is state has continued, with few exceptions, for 12 years. Time has similarly largely stopped as an on-going phenomenon on a day-to-day basis. \"Chopping wood and carrying water\", and even planning and learning, have continued, but without self-referential thoughts, they occur without a clear sense of their happening \"in time\". Drawing upon Zen, advaita and yoga of different types, diverse experiential and practical approaches to reducing the intensity, type and number of thoughts, as well as potentially stopping them, will be presented. These approaches are derived from the speaker's book \"Happiness Beyond thought: A Practical Guide to Awakening\", and his presentations and articles.

In the togetherness of the satsang, in her response to questions being asked about all aspects of life, there is a spontaneous expression of universal truth, as an ongoing encouragement to come to rest in natural peace. http://www.prajnaparamita.nl","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5p0SMWVbMo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5p0SMWVbMo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5p0SMWVbMo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5p0SMWVbMo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5p0SMWVbMo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":860,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"j5p0SMWVbMo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"gOXUs1DmwzkWLgAkUDlL8ExTegA","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnVjT3pXYW5kZ1BR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-05-06T18:39:20Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Is the self an unanswerable mystery? - Sue Blackmore","description":"This is an excerpt from the interview with Sue Blackmore at the Science and Nonduality Conference 2013 featured in the 3DVD set \"Science and Nonduality Anthology Vol.4\".

Happily, there is an important exception: sometimes while dreaming, we become conscious that we are dreaming. This remarkable state of consciousness is referred to as \"lucid dreaming\" and is learnable and rewarding. Scientific research has proven the objective reality of lucid dreams, and has led to the development of new methods of inducing them. I will provide a brief overview of lucid dreaming, touching on techniques and technology for achieving lucid dreaming; a model of dreaming and waking consciousness; scientific research on mind-body relationships during REM sleep; and several applications of lucid dreaming ‚Äî exploring consciousness, enhancing creativity, personal development and self-integration, dream yoga, and transcendent experience.\n\nOf the many applications and implications of lucid dreaming, the one of greatest, deepest meaning is its potential to stimulate spiritual awakening. Implicit in lucid dreaming is the knowledge that one is dreaming, which is to say, that one is not awake. Yet this is the paradox: as the beginning of wisdom is \"to know that one knows nothing,\" so too, the beginning of awakening is to know that one is not awake. If we suppose we already are awake, as we do in both the dreams we call \"false awakenings\" and also those we do not call dreams at all, but presumptively term \"waking life,\" how can we even frame the possibility of waking up? We already (believe) we are. Yet as both ancient Eastern spiritual teachings and recent Western psychological science agree, much of ordinary life is lived in such an automatic unconscious manner, that to say that most of us somnambulate through life seems little exaggeration. \n\nIn the words of Bahauddin Naqshband (d. 1388) \"Here we are all of us in a dream caravan. A caravan, but a dream. A dream, but a caravan. And we know which are the dreams. Therein lies the hope.\"\n\nSTEPHEN LABERGE, PH.D.\nFounder of The Lucidity Institute\nStephen LaBerge is the first scientist to empirically prove the existence of the phenomena of lucid dreaming. His work has developed this technique into a powerful tool for studying mind-body relationships in the dream state and he has demonstrated the considerable potential for lucid dreaming in the fields of psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine. His book on the subject, Lucid Dreaming, Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming and his more academic Conscious Mind, Sleeping Brain have received enormous popular interest. He is the founder of The Lucidity Institute, an organization that promotes research into lucid dreaming, as well as running courses for the general public on how to achieve a lucid dream.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QRs8sR3B2AY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QRs8sR3B2AY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QRs8sR3B2AY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QRs8sR3B2AY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QRs8sR3B2AY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":869,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QRs8sR3B2AY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"MHU2_3Mv3fO79hYJ4EoP5sRDOUg","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmdjbzAxU3NjSE44","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-02-06T20:10:41Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Fearless Science, Cassandra Vieten","description":"The frontier of science is the investigation of consciousness--in particular, the nonlocal,\ncausal, and nondual aspects of consciousness.

From adaptive mutation to psi phenomena to water memory to UFOlogy, from plant consciousness to morphic resonance, the \"excluded other\" in science points to a transition in the defining mythology of civilization. Each bespeaks a universe in which intelligence, purpose, and consciousness are not the sole province of human beings, vitiating a key pillar of dualistic thinking. Because they pose such an ideological and psychological threat, these theories incite a more-than-intellectual hostility. This talk will explore the crisis of science and the emergence of a new mythology that might, not replace, but transcend and include it.\n\nCHARLES EISENSTEIN\nCharles Eisenstein is a teacher, speaker, and writer focusing on themes of civilization, consciousness, money, and human cultural evolution.

Perception, often treated as if it were only physical, h needs better tools. The one thing we do know about any sensory information is that it undergoes a transformation from being something outside of ourselves to being experienced internally. Every sense impression undergoes a series of changes once it touches those parts of the body able to perceive it. What we receive is the final result of complex reorganizations of those incoming sensations.\n\nRemarkable perceptions, which could be subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation, arise from the interaction of psychedelics, the sensory apparatus and the perceiving brain. What conventional science has missed is the possible use of these substances to more deeply understand the interface of brain and external sensation. Putting aside the spiritual, therapeutic, and recreational uses of psychedelics, we can see that the substances and the way they transform conventional sensory inputs makes them powerful tools in, as yet, barely used ways. The ability to repeatedly induce visual phantasmagoria, synesthesia, as well as shifting the locus of perception from inside the personality to other ways of perceiving should have already changed the scientific investigational methodologies for the understanding of perception.\n\nCertainly, the changing scientific paradigm about these substances‚Äîfrom illegal and by definition, no uses‚Äîto an appreciation of the novel and multiple uses of each of the different substances, will lead to their acceptance for scientific exploration and elucidation, as valuablein its way as the electron microscope in deepening our understanding of basic processes. We will look at some of the available data, and its implication for the understanding not only of perception, but of the unbinding of perception from its usual companion, personal identity.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62AA4F40RNc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62AA4F40RNc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62AA4F40RNc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62AA4F40RNc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62AA4F40RNc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":872,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"62AA4F40RNc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"rvJ10eh0l4v8OuyUoS_Gd6tTuS4","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmozN2NESHN5OXpr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-01-16T22:18:29Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Laura Inserra Hang Concert SAND13","description":"Composer and multi-instrumentalist Laura Inserra is a classically trained musician with\na strong improvisational background.

We might ask the same questions about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Milarepa, or a host of other historically prominent figures associated with special illumination, wisdom, or grace. Did these people just sport great tans and know how to work a crowd, or did they understand something genuinely deep about the human condition, about consciousness, and about our capacities, that are not yet within the purview of science?\n\nAsking such questions about revered religious icons is asking for trouble, so we may consider a more contemporary figure. The Dalai Lama regularly hosts discussions between scientists and Buddhist scholars as part of an ongoing series of dialogs sponsored by the Mind and Life Institute. Do the scientists who compete for a coveted slot at one of those celebrated meetings secretly believe that the Dalai Lama is a backwards country bumpkin, and they're just humoring him long enough to get their photo taken with a famous Nobel Laureate so they can post it on their Facebook page? Or does the Dalai Lama know something that science ignores publicly but is fascinated by privately?\n\nThis presentation will offer answers to these questions based not on opinion, but on analysis of decades of experimental data collected in dozens of laboratories around the world,and regularly published in scientific journals.\n\n\nDEAN RADIN, PH.D\nSenior Scientist at the IONS\nSenior Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) and Adjunct Faculty in the Department of Psychology at Sonoma State University.

Neuroscience assigns mental activity to physical process. This has yielded little in the actual understanding of the mind. Relying on physicalist assumptions actually assumes a world view put to rest by quantum theory more than 80 years ago.\n\nWhat I propose is an uncompromising view of the fundamental nature of underlying consciousness, the source of the mind. It is based on the \"amazing hypothesis\", reality is amazing because at some levels is very simple, while at the same time mysterious. The universe is much richer than our perceptions tell us, infinitely so. Perception limits what we view as reality because it depends on our senses, our own specific environment in our own planetary system, our own species. It is a prism that distorts underlying reality.\n\nThis underlying reality is universal Consciousness, which operates at every level of existence of the universe, the physical, the mental, the beyond. It is founded on the fundamentalI awareness, which is the true Self. The Self projects the universe out of its own infinite existence, through a series of fundamental principles, which apply at all levels, by first separating Itself from Itself, in what appear as infinite numbers of objects. However, it never loses its own I-ness. In the unfoldment of the universe, qualia, the collection of vast numbers of subjective experiences, play a fundamental role, for all species, of all individual organisms. Perception is based on qualia, perception is in fact qualia.\n\nThe sages of ancient monistic schools, the philosophers, taught through practical steps the experience of the Self. Its names are infinite, its nature mysterious because it can never be studied through perception or through the mind. But it is the one, amazing truth: The creative process can be experienced in one's own being. The Self should be understood and experienced as the ultimate Witness Consciousness. In this vision, the Universe is participatory, consisting of countless acts of observation, forming a web of entangled processes at all levels, obeying fundamental principles which the Self utilizes in the creative process. The new, emerging science will be seen as Observer-based Science, distinguishing it, but complementary to, current Object-based Science.\n\nMENAS KAFATOS\nProfessor of Computational Physics and Director of Excellence at Chapman University\nDr. Menas Kafatos is The Fletcher Jones Endowed Professor of Computational Physics and Director of Excellence at Chapman University.

These forms are real, even though they are invisible, because they have the potential to act on us. They form a realm of potentiality in the background of the visible reality and all empirical things and concepts are emanations out of this realm.

All\nwe know of thoughts, sensations and perceptions is the experience of thinking, sensing and perceiving. And all we know of thinking, sensing and perceiving is the knowing of them. In fact, we never find the 'them'.\n\nWe just know Knowing. And what is it that knows this Knowing? Is it known by something other than itself? No! It knows itself. It is Knowing that knows Knowing. All experience is the light of pure Knowing being and knowing itself alone, and, because it never knows or comes in contact with anything other than itself, we can also say, loving itself alone. However, in order to know itself, Knowing does not separate itself into two parts, and become a subject, located in and as the body, that knows an object, other or world. There is no subject-object relationship in its knowing of itself.\n\nNot to know an object as an object is the experience of beauty; not to know an other as an other is the experience of love. Beauty is the essential nature of all perception; love is the essential nature of all feeling. Beauty and love, the essential nature of all experience: two names for the knowing of our Being, its knowing of itself, as it truly is.\n\nRUPERT SPIRA\n\nFrom an early age Rupert was deeply interested in the nature of Reality.

This is troubling, since we have a large body of correlations between brain activity and consciousness, correlations normally assumed to entail that brain activity creates conscious experience. Here I explore a solution to the mind-body problem that starts with the converse assumption: these correlations arise because consciousness creates brain activity, and indeed creates all objects and properties of the physical world. To this end, I develop two theses. The interface theory of perception states that perceptual experiences do not match or approximate properties of the objective world, but instead provide a simplified, species-specific, user interface to that world. Conscious realism states that the objective world consists of conscious agents and their experiences; these can be mathematically modeled and empirically explored in the normal scientific manner.\n\nIn support of the interface theory of perception, I present Monte Carlo simulations of evolutionary games in which perceptual strategies that see the truth compete with perceptual strategies that do not see the truth but are instead tuned to fitness. The result is that natural selection drives true perceptions to swift extinction. Our perceptions have evolved to guide adaptive behaviors, not to report the truth.\n\nIn support of conscious realism, I present a dynamical theory of consciousness in which the observer and the observed have precisely the same mathematical structure, i.e., in which there is a mathematically precise nondualism. I then derive the quantum wave function of the free particle from the asymptotic behavior of the conscious dynamics. This is a step toward solving the mind-body problem from the assumption that consciousness, not physics, is fundamental.\n\nDONALD HOFFMAN, PHD\nDonald Hoffman is a cognitive scientist and author of more than 90 scientific papers and three books, including Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See (W.W. Norton, 2000). He received his BA from UCLA in Quantitative Psychology and his Ph.D. from MIT in Computational Psychology. He joined the faculty of UC Irvine in 1983, where he is now a full professor in the departments of cognitive science, computer science and philosophy. He received the Distinguished Scientific Award of the American Psychological Association for early career research into visual perception, and the Troland Research Award of the US National Academy of Sciences for his research on the relationship of consciousness and the physical world. He was chosen by students at UC Irvine to receive a campus-wide teaching award, and to be included in Who's Who Among America's Teachers.\n\nHoffman studies visual perception, visual attention and consciousness using mathematical models, computer simulations, and psychological experiments. His empirical research has led to new insights into how we perceive objects, colors and motion. His theoretical research has led to a \"user interface\" theory of perception‚Äîwhich proposes that natural selection shapes our perceptions not to report truth but simply to guide adaptive behavior. It has also led to a \"conscious realism\" theory of consciousness‚Äîwhich proposes a formal model of consciousness and the mind-body problem that takes consciousness as fundamental.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDP34a-epI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDP34a-epI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDP34a-epI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDP34a-epI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDP34a-epI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":883,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dqDP34a-epI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"crzLjHToGyfYgN2DDF-BVY4bNoo","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lmx5N1c2YzdST0dj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-12-09T18:27:22Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Wisdom from Our Spiritual Ancestors - Mathew Fox","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nToday's science assures us that perception is a less passive activity than we have sometimes been taught: In fact, much of what we perceive we create.

Richards and MLK Junior, and more, to learn anew how their perceptions can and have rocked our worlds. Also some scientists such as Einstein, Darwin and Rupert Sheldrake. On the dark side, we will consider shadow perceptions in our midst put forth recently by the Supreme Court in two decisions that threaten to lay waste the liberating perceptions of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln. Meister Eckhart says: \"God is present with all his bliss and all the angels inside of me but I do not perceive this.\" What holds us back from deeper and surer perceptions?

Many teachings emphasize that enlightenment is seeing how things actually are. However, the vision of reality given by the various teachings vary in significant ways. Does this mean one of them is the right one or are all correct? What are the implications about reality in either case? I will present a vision of perception in spiritual realization that parallels the view in quantum theory of the relation between the observer and reality. Since in spiritual realization reality is more fundamental than the observer, actually manifesting the observer, the vision brings in the subtleties of realization and why there are many kinds.

The proposed changes involve the nature of consciousness and its relationship to matter, dimensions of the human psyche, the roots of emotional and psychosomatic disorders, and therapeutic strategy. In the light of the new observations, spirituality appears to be an essential attribute of the human psyche and of existence in general.\n\nWithout these changes, the understanding of psychogenic emotional and psychosomatic disorders and their therapy will be superficial, unsatisfactory, and incomplete. Psychiatry and psychology will lack genuine comprehension of the nature and origin of spirituality and of the important role that it plays in the human psyche and in the universal scheme of things. Many potentially healing and transformative experiences (\"spiritual emergencies\") will be misdiagnosed as psychotic and treated by suppressive medication. In addition, a large array of the experiences and observations from the research of holotropic states will remain mystifying \"anomalous phenomena\", events that according to the current scientific paradigms are in principle not be possible and should not occur. \n\nSTANISLAV GROF, M.D., PH.D.\nStan Grof, M.D., Ph.D. is a psychiatrist with more than fifty years experience researching the healing and transformative potential of non-ordinary states of consciousness.

No longer deny and no longer ignore your very wisdom heart. There is nothing to acquire, self-realisation is beyond any domain of attaining or doing. It is a revelation, a realisation of the undividable, all pervading mystery. A shift of perspective, a shift from I to Thou. I, your point of reference evaporates, and you are no longer anchored in I, but in the heart of all.\nI, the root of all delusion and suffering, is an imagined separation from totality. We have come to see ourselves as an aspect of life, but we are life itself. The ensuing loneliness and constant craving push more and more people into a journey to search for the missing part, whereas all it takes is a shift of perspective. In this shift I cannot continue. I simply dissolves and your being comes to rest in All. Once this standpoint dissolves, your view becomes wide open and ideas become objects to play with.\n\nYou come to live your best life, where all your qualities are fully expressed. Nothing needs to be avoided or suppressed any more. You are simply present, simply aware. There is no more fight and no more fear.

And our natural response is to jump to the conclusion that seeing is easy. There seems to be a conscious 'me' inside my head who is looking out through my eyes at a world outside. The trouble is -- this impossibly dualist conception would entail a little homunculus inside who in turn has eyes and a brain to see with, and so on to an infinite regress. So we have to throw out that idea.\n\nBut there is worse to come. Even if we think we can get rid of the separate observer, we are still tempted to think that the brain must build a picture inside the head that corresponds to the vivid picture we see in front of us. Yet this too has to be false. Research reveals that when it comes to conscious vision, we cannot be seeing what we think we are seeing, and we must be deeply deluded about how our perception works.\n\nWith demonstrations and help from the audience I shall explore some of the ways in which we misunderstand our own minds. Multiple images show that we can see something that we have not even looked at. The phenomenon of change blindness shows that the richness of our visual world must be an illusion: we think we see a rich and vivid image of the world around us but our visual system never constructs anything like such a picture, and never pulls together all the things we believe we can see all at once. Demonstrations of inattentional blindness show that we can look right at something and not see it at all. Vision cannot be what it seems to be.

The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true. Niels Bohr: Quantum Physicist and Nobel Prize Winner\n\nThe theme of this years conference is 'perception'. In this presentation Tim Freke will outline the essence of his paralogical philosophy, (which is based on an understanding of the paradoxical nature of life), so that we can directly experience the radical change in perception that arises from it. Freke discriminates logical thinking and paralogical thinking. Logical thinking adopts an 'either/or' perspective. It is based on the principle that something is either true or it isn't true, so the opposite of a logical truth is false. Paralogical thinking adopts a 'both/and' perspective. It is based on the realisation that essentially life is paradoxical, so the opposite of a paralogical truth can also be true.\nIf we want to understand the surface of life logical thinking works perfectly. But to understand the depths of things we need to think paralogically, because the universe is essentially paradoxical. We need to see things from two opposite perspectives at once.\nTo help us directly experience the paralogical perspective, Tim Freke explores:\n‚Ä¢ The wave-particle duality as an example of the paradoxical nature of reality.\n‚Ä¢ Binocular vision as a metaphor for paralogical perception.\n‚Ä¢ The coexistence of the dual and non-dual perceptions of the universe.\n‚Ä¢ Experiencing each other as objective and subjective beings.\n‚Ä¢ Honoring both the separateness of the soul and the oneness of being.\n‚Ä¢ Apperceiving that the world is both real and unreal.\n‚Ä¢ Taoism, yin/yang and paralogical philosophy\n‚Ä¢ The paralogical compatibility of deep spirituality and deep science.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZmJUYIsp98/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZmJUYIsp98/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZmJUYIsp98/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZmJUYIsp98/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZmJUYIsp98/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":898,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nZmJUYIsp98"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"xusyiFK66vDoSehy1GrYbbErNVg","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjdfWjkydGVIdzZN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-08-07T00:15:57Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Idealism Reloaded: The End of the Perception-Imagination Duality, Bernardo Kastrup","description":"www.scienceandnonduality.com\nThis lecture was presented at SAND13 Europe in Doorn (The Netherlands).\n\nIdealism Reloaded: The End of the Perception-Imagination Duality, Bernardo Kastrup \n\nIt's curious how we seem to differentiate our mental categories: We assume that perceptions (what we see, hear, smell, touch, or taste) come from 'outside,' while thoughts, affections, and imagination unfold 'inside.' Yet, they are all phenomena of mind, witnessed in consciousness in exactly the same way. Why, then, do we make the categorical split?\n\nThere are two reasons for it: Firstly, the existence of a world outside of mind seems necessary to explain the fact that we all seem to share a common reality. Secondly, while we feel that we have some degree of control over our thoughts, emotions, and imagination, the world we perceive with our sense organs seems entirely autonomous. To explain both of these observations we postulate the existence of a whole abstract universe of particles and fields, fundamentally independent of subjective experience, which supposedly leaves a consistent imprint on our sense organs. Moreover,\nwe go on to postulate that it is the abstract particles and fields in this strongly objective universe that, somehow, give rise to the concreteness of subjective experience itself.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_Z92teHw6M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_Z92teHw6M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_Z92teHw6M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_Z92teHw6M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7_Z92teHw6M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":899,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7_Z92teHw6M"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZGEgKAZzehlaLlAmBKJAteZ6vr8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjFJbm9rOWhaZzVN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-08-05T16:56:23Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Now We Are Awake, Are We Going to Save The Planet?","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\n\"So, Now We Are Awake, Are We Going To Save The Planet?\", a panel conversation with Elisabet Sahtouris, John Hagelin, Jeff Warren facilitated by Conscious TV.

Likewise, if the body and mind are considered to be real in their own right, there is a distinction to be made between Myself and them.\n\nHowever, having discovered Me, pure Knowing, as the ever-present and limitless reality\n'behind' all changing appearances of the body, mind and world, these appearances themselves can be revisited and discovered to have no real, independently existing reality of their own, just as there is no actual 'thing' called an image, independent of the screen. 'Image' is simply a temporary name and form of the screen, which is their true reality. The apparently limited body, mind and world are temporary names and forms of My ever-present, unlimited reality.\n\nIn other words, having discovered Me as the ever-present and unlimited background of all\nexperience, I am now revealed as its very substance or reality. I, pure Knowing, am not just independent of the body, mind and world, I am intimately one with them; not just transcendent, but immanent. I am not just freedom; I am love.\n\nAnd now, having discovered Me as the sole reality of all experience, it is no longer necessary or even possible to name Me, for there is nothing left with which to compare Me. As such, I have no name or form but appear as all names and forms.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjwBWE64fG0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjwBWE64fG0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjwBWE64fG0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjwBWE64fG0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjwBWE64fG0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":901,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xjwBWE64fG0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NG_iXXbXeqSBEX0XjqpF48JtaxU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lmp6YWZCNk5LSGlz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-07-15T16:12:01Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Lothar Schafer: Quantum Reality and the Spiritual Mind","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nLothar Schafer draws from Quantum Science and Ancient Mystics ways to unleash\nour creative potential.\n\nLothar Sch√§fer is a Distinguished Professor (Emeritus) of Physical Chemistry at the University of Arkansas.

Neuroscience assigns mental activity to physical process. This has yielded little in the actual understanding of the mind. Relying on physicalist assumptions actually assumes a world view put to rest by quantum theory more than 80 years ago. What I propose is an uncompromising view of the fundamental nature of underlying consciousness, the source of the mind. It is based on the \"amazing hypothesis\", reality is amazing because at some levels is very simple, while at the same time mysterious. The universe is much richer than our perceptions tell us, infinitely so. Perception limits what we view as reality because it depends on our senses, our own specific environment in our own planetary system, our own species. It is a prism that distorts underlying reality.\n\nThis underlying reality is universal Consciousness, which operates at every level of existence of the universe, the physical, the mental, the beyond. It is founded on the fundamental I-awareness, which is the true Self. The Self projects the universe out of its own infinite existence, through a series of fundamental principles, which apply at all levels, by first separating Itself from Itself, in what appear as infinite numbers of objects. However, it never loses its own I-ness. In the unfoldment of the universe, qualia, the collection of vast numbers of subjective experiences, play a fundamental role, for all species, of all individual organisms. Perception is based on qualia, perception is in fact qualia.\n\nThe sages of ancient monistic schools, the philosophers, taught through practical steps the experience of the Self. Its names are infinite, its nature mysterious because it can never be studied through perception or through the mind. But it is the one, amazing truth: The creative process can be experienced in one's own being. The Self should be understood and experienced as the ultimate Witness Consciousness. In this vision, the Universe is participatory, consisting of countless acts of observation, forming a web of entangled processes at all levels, obeying fundamental principles which the Self utilizes in the creative process.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mGELW08Q9w/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mGELW08Q9w/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mGELW08Q9w/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mGELW08Q9w/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mGELW08Q9w/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":903,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3mGELW08Q9w"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Z4ytWYW-kQz1rttM6AQXCedlx-0","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmF2eVVzUGdJdVEw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-07-05T19:36:57Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Mystery of Perception During Near Death Experiences - Pim van Lommel","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\nhttp://www.pimvanlommel.nl\n\nPIM VAN LOMMEL, MD\nCardiologist/Author\n\nIn our prospective study of 344 patients who survived cardiac arrest we had to come to the surprising conclusion that all the reported elements of a Near-Death Experience (NDE) like an out-of-body perception, meeting with deceased relatives or a life review were experienced during a transient functional loss of the cortex and of the brainstem, with a flat line EEG. During their cardiac arrest people can have veridical perceptions from a position outside and above their lifeless body. NDE-ers have the feeling that they have apparently taken off their body like an old coat and to their surprise they appear to have retained their own identity with the possibility of perception, emotions, and a very clear consciousness. This out-of-body experience (OBE) is scientifically important because doctors, nurses, and relatives can verify the reported perceptions, and they can also corroborate the precise moment the NDE with OBE occurred during the period of CPR. This proves that an OBE cannot be a hallucination, because this means experiencing a perception that has no basis in \"reality\", like in psychosis, neither it can be a delusion, which is an incorrect assessment of a correct perception, nor an illusion, which means a misleading image. Moreover, one needs a functioning brain for experiencing hallucinations, delusions or illusions. Additionally, even people blind from birth have reported veridical perceptions during NDE and OBE. Based on several NDE-studies it seems inevitable to conclude that veridical perception is possible independently of brain function. In my lecture I will give several examples of veridical perceptions during NDE, and discuss the differences between seeing with the eyes during waking consciousness (who is seeing? what is seeing?) and perceiving during the period of a non-functioning brain ('apparent unconsciousness during clinical death').","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avyUsPgIuQ0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avyUsPgIuQ0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avyUsPgIuQ0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avyUsPgIuQ0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avyUsPgIuQ0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":904,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"avyUsPgIuQ0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2vr1gXC33gYhV3XbbZ-JeewqJh8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmVEM1h2a2Nibjdj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-07-02T07:27:40Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Tony Parsons' Talk and Q&A at SAND13 Doorn, The Netherlands","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\nhttp://www.theopensecret.com\n\nA unified reality in which there are \"not two\" or there is \"nothing apart\" surely confirms the illusory nature of separation. If separation is illusory, then any attempt to not be separate is rooted in a dualistic perspective. So the basic principle of any guidance which attempts to transform an illusory state of being separate into a state of at-oneness is based on the belief in a divided reality and cannot therefore claim to be non-dual.\n\nHowever, as long as oneness appears as a seeker with personal needs there will also arise a personal response and guidance from others together with a description of their approach to satisfying those needs. Teachings apparently happen together with recommendations and processes to help the seeker change or be more open to a better experience. This personal guidance assumes the existence of free will, choice and the ability and need to pursue a progressive path leading to personal fulfillment.\n\nThe open secret perception is that what is ultimately longed for cannot be taught, given, attained or known.\n\nThe view here is that the sense of seeming separate is an illusory state which drives the apparent seeker to search for another illusory state called enlightenment. Any activity which supports this construct is apparently only reinforcing and perpetuating the same dualistic illusion and attempting to create personal experiences that can make the sense of separation more acceptable... for a while.\n\nIt is all only oneness playing a game of hide and seek. The open secret exposes what it sees as the myth of separation and personal enlightenment. It will also attempt to describe the nature of what is and isn't and point to the paradox of no thing simultaneously appearing to be everything. http://www.theopensecret.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eD3Xvkcbn7c/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eD3Xvkcbn7c/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eD3Xvkcbn7c/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eD3Xvkcbn7c/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eD3Xvkcbn7c/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":905,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eD3Xvkcbn7c"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"kPJ5_phv32NMm0v0aJUuDtRX2Q8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lmhvb2ZPOUJhS2tV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-05-14T20:22:59Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"No You and No Me, Just the Loving Awareness in Which All Appears - Rick Linchitz","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\"No You and No Me.

The brain, to create meaning where there is possibly none, processes perception from the unperceived and thought from the unthinkable. The process of perception is in fact one of creation. What we perceive is not what is out there or within. There is no inherent value in the incredibly complex patterns of light that fall onto our eyes, and yet we see coherent forms and motions that enable us to survive. Exploring the nature of perception can help us glimpse life beyond experiencer and experience, perceiver and perception. \n\nVideo  by: Zaya and Maurizio Benazzo\nMusic by: Olive Musique","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fn4dwcO9yLA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fn4dwcO9yLA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fn4dwcO9yLA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fn4dwcO9yLA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fn4dwcO9yLA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":907,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"fn4dwcO9yLA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"K8QjRvThEY-5kt7lvqllQpo2nEg","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjFSeFIwNDBtZzJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-04-05T00:37:13Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Body-Mind - temporary modulation of awareness, Rupert Spira","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nClip from Rupert Spira's talk at SAND'12.

Quantum field theory assigns the origin of the Higgs and all fields to the quantum vacuum. Far from being empty, the quantum vacuum contains ubiquitous fields, filling all space. These virtual fields, although not appearing in the usual physical sense, they are nevertheless \"there\" and they are \"felt\". In fact, physicists have known for more than fifty years that quantum fields and, ultimately, at the limit of unification of gravity with quantum theory, at the Planck dimension, the \"emptiness\" of the vacuum overwhelms everything of physical substance in terms of potential energies and huge numbers of particles. Out of the quantum vacuum, not only do particles emanate, because of the uncertainty principle, entire universes can pop out. The discovery may even help us understand why it appears that all the visible matter in the universe makes up only 4% of whatever there is. The rest may be dark matter and even more (repulsive) dark energy. Not only is the vacuum full of stuff, it is full of dark stuff!\n\nThe quantum vacuum may even be involved in living and even brain processes. This would not be surprising, if everything physical owes its existence to the vacuum, shouldn't (those who follow a physicalist view of the cosmos would agree) then even life and consciousness ultimately be tied to the vacuum? It is all in the emptiness.\n\nFor us, seeking a non-dualist paradigm, these statements about the quantum vacuum, point to something else that is vast, empty, beyond thoughts, while at the same time being the source of all thoughts, all object awareness, blissful awareness in Being, manifesting throughout the universe. With the progress brought about through the development of quantum theory, the act of observation has taken a central role: No quantum properties exist without the act of observation. Our universe is a participatory one, it would not exist without observations. Besides following what science and mathematics imply, direct experience is most important. Beyond thoughts, the emptiness of the Self, in analogy to the quantum vacuum, contains everything. Let's explore these possibilities and realities together.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0K117Zxcq0s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0K117Zxcq0s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0K117Zxcq0s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":913,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"0K117Zxcq0s"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"nJ9u1aq9Kj-ivw_n5FTpgtFWKA0","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LldLS01MWEl4UWRv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-01-13T00:07:39Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Nature of Self - Gangaji","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nClip from Gangaji's talk at SAND'12, California.

Although such experiences have been described by mystics and religious figures throughout the ages, there are few meaningful prospective experimental studies because such experiences usually occur at low rates and often unpredictably. Recent studies at Johns Hopkins showed that, under carefully controlled conditions, psilocybin can occasion profound personally and spiritually meaningful mystical-type experiences in the majority of healthy participants. Analysis showed that mystical-type experiences mediate sustained positive changes in attitudes, moods, personality, and behavior. With regard to attitudes about Self, volunteers endorsed feeling more personal integration, inner authority, creativity, authenticity, and self-confidence. They also reported an increased sense that all of life is interconnected, and less concern with thoughts and feelings about their bodies. An ongoing study in novice meditators is exploring whether psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experiences can further enhance the positive persisting effects of meditation and other spiritual practices. Therapeutic studies are currently investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of anxiety and depression in cancer patients and psilocybin-facilitated cigarette smoking cessation using a cognitive-behavioral approach. Further research with psilocybin can be expected to provide unique insights into the biology and psychology of mystical experience, and may hold promise as a paradigm-shifting treatment approach. \n\nRoland Griffiths, Ph.D. is a professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neurosciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztMvt4Fxzg8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztMvt4Fxzg8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztMvt4Fxzg8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztMvt4Fxzg8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":915,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ztMvt4Fxzg8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"FP1lmO3oTzY4aLV2rQHc68KZA0Q","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkZHMWdaLWFnanZZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-01-11T20:57:10Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Exploring the Self Scientifically - Magic Mushrooms or Meditation - Gary Weber","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nThis is a clip from Gary Weber talk at Science and Nonduality Conference 2012 for more talks visit: http://fora.tv/conference/science_and_nonduality_sand_conference_2012\n\nExploring the Self Scientifically - Magic Mushrooms or Meditation - The Same Route, The Same Result\n\nMagic mushrooms, with psilocybin as their active ingredient, have been used at least since 10,000 BCE for purposes ranging from shamanic healing to spiritual awakening through mystical experiences. Meditation has similarly been used for millenia for various purposes, including spiritual awakening in many traditions, often accompanied with mystical experiences. Only recently has the cognitive neuroscience been developed to determine how each of these powerful approaches operates in/on the brain.\n\nJust released work on psilocybin in one of the most prestigious journals done at some of the world's top universities is the first known scientific investigation to reveal the operations of the centers and networks in the brain involved in generating the effects of psilocybin. The latest fMRI technology and arterial spin labeling perfusion have been coupled to determine what the cerebral blood flow in individual brain centers is and how those centers are activated and coupled with other centers as the psilocybin levels are increased.\n\nComparing this work with the latest work coupling cognitive neuroscience and meditation, the astonishing finding is that the same centers involved in generating the transcendent and mystical effects in meditation are the same ones that are manipulated by psilocybin.\n\nNot only that, but recent studies on the mystical experiences of persistently non-dual meditators as measured by the Hood Mystical Scale show that some of these meditators score at the highest possible score; a group of them has the highest average on this scale. Surprisingly, the group that had the average mystical score closest to the persistent non-dual meditators was the psychedelics.\n\nThe amazing conclusion is that both non-dual meditation and magic mushrooms produce very similar or the same mystical experiences by the same cognitive neuroscientific route.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FG1gZ-agjvY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FG1gZ-agjvY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FG1gZ-agjvY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FG1gZ-agjvY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":916,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FG1gZ-agjvY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6NYZJe4zN6mV7TqQ049J7B1BiMQ","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmIyU1JWcjg5R0ZV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-01-10T02:32:19Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Centering Prayer and the Foundations of Non-dual Awareness - Cynthia Bourgeault","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\n\nClip from Cynthia Bourgeault talk at SAND'12, California.

What Christian mystics have long known as the practice of surrender, powerfully encapsulated in Centering Prayer's distinctive method of meditation, proves itself to be a powerful foundation for the movement beyond the dualistic perception (with the subect/object dichotomy as its driveshaft) into a unified‚Äîi.e., nondual‚Äîfield of perception.

In this lecture I explore the idea that we are dynamically distributed, boundary crossing, offloaded, and environmentally situated, by our very nature. What explains our inability until now to understand consciousness is that we've been searching for it in the wrong place. To better understand ourselves, we need to get out of our heads! \n\nAlva No√´ is a writer and philosopher at UC Berkeley, where he is also a member of the Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences and the Center for New Media.

How can long-term meditative practices enable us to live less Self-centered lives that are more compassionate, and happier?\n\nMeditation turns out to train our two complementary forms of attentiveness. When starting off in concentrative meditation, our Self still tends to stay 'in there' --- trying to 'do it' in --- an egocentric, top-down manner. Receptive meditation helps us let go of this exclusively Self-centered frame of reference. Its global awareness stays poised to notice any relevant stimulus, one that might arrive unexpectantly from 'out there.' This 'bottom-up' spatial awareness operates reflexly, other-referentially, allo-centrically, choicelessly.\n\nRecent neuroscience research has identified a dorsal attention pathway on the outside surface of the brain. It does more than attend to our external environment; its trajectory also overlaps these fronto-parietal regions that actively process the representations of our physical Self (our soma). Functional MRI shows that when this lateral attentive system is activated, our Self-relational network (mostly on the inside of the brain) is deactivated. Up, in the pre-frontal cortex, these medial representations process many autobiographical aspects of our psyche. Farther back in parietal regions, their I-Me-Mine functions blend into a memory-based consortium that helps us navigate through the details of our environment.\n\nConcrete examples illustrate ways to cultivate a balanced program of mindfully attentive meditative training. Over the long-term, how can this blend of complementary capacities --- combining the assets of both focused and global attentiveness --- nurture the brain's inherent potentials for non-dual consciousness? By reducing our maladaptive tendencies toward Self-centeredness.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Edgqlsy9QM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Edgqlsy9QM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Edgqlsy9QM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Edgqlsy9QM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Edgqlsy9QM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":920,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2Edgqlsy9QM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9hG0DZEWQYnXj3YwKOFtfPcvXrM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjVqUWtXWW5BOVZR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-12-18T22:25:43Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"I have no Name or Form but Appear as All Names and Forms - Rupert Spira","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nClip from Rupert Spira's talk at SAND'12.

The spiritual is said to \"transcend\" the physical universe. But the new cosmology challenges this whole outlook on reality -- not by telling us what the spiritual is but by clarifying what the physical is. It turns out that most of the universe is many orders of magnitude either larger or smaller than the sizes we're used to, and the result is that events on all those exotic size scales are not physical in the ordinary sense and can never be directly experienced, even though they are real and governed by laws of physics. There is no dichotomy between physical and spiritual. Physical-to-spiritual is a continuum, and our physical world is at the center. This insight can explode our consciousness out of the narrow sliver of human experience and intuition to grasp the astonishing completeness that encompasses, and is, us. This must be the universe's way of knowing itself, since complex consciousness like ours can only exist in creatures that, like us, are approximately in the middle of all possible sizes. Appreciating the vast range of size scales and timescales that lie beyond direct human experience is a new kind of cosmic consciousness. It can not only expand our personal identities but also reveal new directions toward solving the global-scale problems that seem intractable from within today's small-scale perspectives.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w2JFnpbPeQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w2JFnpbPeQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w2JFnpbPeQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2w2JFnpbPeQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":922,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2w2JFnpbPeQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"goDaO7VekS05CvpHUW5yoKdAqag","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Ll9PcS1jaVh6QmhR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-12-17T23:46:02Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Consciousness of the Cosmos - Joel Primack","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nClip from Joel Primack's talk at SAND'12.

For one thing, it is 99.5% invisible -- everything visible makes up only about half of one percent of the cosmic density. But a combination of observations, theory, and supercomputer simulations has allowed us to visualize the evolution and structure of the entire universe, the invisible as well as the visible, from the Big Bang to the present and into the future. The invisible dark matter and dark energy control the evolution and future of the cosmos. In the far future, the visible universe will consist of just the nearby galaxies that are bound together by gravity.

I will discuss how enlightenment can be seen as self realization or selfless realization. However, I will focus on the obstacle of the self, its physical/psychological/spiritual nature, the illusiveness of this nature, and the question of whether it is our creation or a natural expression of reality. What does freedom from self means? \n\nHameed Ali (A. H. Almaas), ph.d.\nFounder of the Diamond Approach¬Æ\n\nHameed Ali (A. H. Almaas), was born in the Middle East, but at age 18 he moved to the USA to study at the University of California in Berkeley. Hameed was working on his Ph.D. in physics, where he was studying Einsteirn's theory of general relativity and nuclear physics, when he reached a turning point in his life and destiny that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. Hameed is the founder of the Diamond Approach¬Æ - a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Freedom is living our realization, a dynamic enlightenment where our transcendent nondual truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization. Almaas' books include: The Inner Journey Home, Essence , The Pearl Beyond Price , Luminous Night's Journey , and The Unfolding Now.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwyJhreVPZA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwyJhreVPZA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwyJhreVPZA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwyJhreVPZA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":928,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lwyJhreVPZA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"jOew3ZB_TOy0Q1kJrTBQI_tYkqI","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lk1iXzBkQ2dWbkZJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-09-27T18:44:39Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Self Illusion - Susan Blackmore","description":"http://www.ScienceAndNonduality.com\n\nThis is a clip from  Susan Blackmore's talk at Science and Nonduality Conference 2012 in The Netherlands. \n\nSue Blackmore is a psychologist and writer researching consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the University of Plymouth.

Is awakening a state? Does the experience of time only exist in relation to the separate self? In the awakening process, is there something that the 'I' has to achieve? What is the function of our emotions? When do emotions become psychological suffering? What is acceptance? How are the nondual teachings evolving? Is there a universal \"now\"?

The remarkable system of methods they developed is today known as shamanism. Shamans are especially distinguished by the use of journeys to hidden worlds otherwise mainly known through myth, dream, and near-death experiences. A core feature of shamanism is that the Universe is divisible into three worlds: the Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Middle World, in which we live, has both its ordinary and non-ordinary (or non-spiritual and spiritual) aspects, and belongs only to this immediate moment in time. The Upper and Lower Worlds, in contrast, are purely spiritual and are found only in nonordinary reality, where they exist outside of time. The trained shaman can make \"out of body\" journeys to these worlds, moving back and forth with discipline and purpose in order to help and heal others. In these journeys, the shaman transcends time, going back to look at the past or traveling into the future to seek assistance on behalf of others from compassionate beings found there. In these worlds, there is no separation between the shaman and everything else. He or she knows, as ancient Siberian shamans knew that, \"Everything that is, is alive.\" The Universe is experienced as a unified whole, and the shaman partakes of the love and the ecstasy of this transcendent reality.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/27DCN0f_1fc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/27DCN0f_1fc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/27DCN0f_1fc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/27DCN0f_1fc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":945,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"27DCN0f_1fc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ND43kGSOLxRz78As6D2UGQWSm6g","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjdlbURXS05jY2Vz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-03-31T19:09:39Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Inquiry intro the Nature of Time with Hameed Ali (A.

The remarkable system of methods they developed is today known as shamanism. Shamans are especially distinguished by the use of journeys to hidden worlds otherwise mainly known through myth, dream, and near-death experiences. A core feature of shamanism is that the Universe is divisible into three worlds: the Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Middle World, in which we live, has both its ordinary and non-ordinary (or non-spiritual and spiritual) aspects, and belongs only to this immediate moment in time. The Upper and Lower Worlds, in contrast, are purely spiritual and are found only in nonordinary reality, where they exist outside of time. The trained shaman can make \"out of body\" journeys to these worlds, moving back and forth with discipline and purpose in order to help and heal others. In these journeys, the shaman transcends time, going back to look at the past or traveling into the future to seek assistance on behalf of others from compassionate beings found there. In these worlds, there is no separation between the shaman and everything else. He or she knows, as ancient Siberian shamans knew that, \"Everything that is, is alive.\" The Universe is experienced as a unified whole, and the shaman partakes of the love and the ecstasy of this transcendent reality.\n\nScience and NonDuality Conference 2011, San Rafael, CA\nhttp://www.scienceandnonduality.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qalP06R-dYs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qalP06R-dYs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qalP06R-dYs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qalP06R-dYs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qalP06R-dYs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":950,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qalP06R-dYs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"XqMdl-0Cwmwr0x3wwaICZJzj5Vk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjRFcmRfUVdfSXNR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-01-24T21:49:30Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Can the presence of awareness ever lack something? - Rupert Spira, SAND11","description":"Science and NonDuality Conference 2011, San Rafael, CA\r\nhttp://www.scienceandnonduality.com\r\n\r\nTIME IS NEVER EXPERIENCED\r\nRupert Spira, Artist and Nonduality Teacher\r\nAll experience is now. Try to step out of now into a past or future. Where do we or could we go? It is not possible to experience a past or future. We experience thoughts about a past or future but never the past and future themselves. This very now is the only now there is. It is not a moment in time. There is no 'present moment.' There is no time present in which the now could move forwards or backwards. It is eternally now. \r\n\r\nUnhappiness is always an avoidance or rejection of the now. Our self, aware presence, is intimately one with all experience in the now. It knows no rejection of the now and is, therefore, happiness itself. The thought-made self is a movement of resistance or seeking, away from the now into an imaginary past or future. All avoidance and seeking is for the thought-made self, never for the true and only self of aware presence. The belief that time is real is essential to the perpetuation of this imaginary self; such a self feeds on the past and future. The now is the only place the separate self cannot stand. The now, in which all peace and happiness reside, is the only place the true and only self can be. \r\n\r\nAll the imaginary self's seeking longs only for the happiness that is inherent in the now. The imaginary self approaches the now like a moth approaches a flame. It longs for the flame but cannot experience it. It can only die in it. Likewise the imaginary self longs only for the happiness that resides in our self. However, it cannot experience it; it can only die in it. That death is the experience of happiness. This happiness lies at the heart of all experience, never imposing itself but never veiling itself, simply waiting with open arms to be recognized.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Erd_QW_IsQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Erd_QW_IsQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Erd_QW_IsQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Erd_QW_IsQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Erd_QW_IsQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":951,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4Erd_QW_IsQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WJSw4_7tRL39NnNV5UwXVMNfvZs","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjEtQ21ZRXloelY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-01-06T22:06:30Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"A Buddhist Perspective on the Eco-crisis - David Loy, Part 1","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\r\n\r\nHealing Ecology: A Buddhist Perspective on the Eco-crisis, part 1\r\nDavid Loy, Zen teacher\r\n\r\nClip from David Loy's talk at Science and Nonduality Conference 2011.\r\n\r\nDo Buddhist teachings imply a different way of understanding our relationship to the biosphere, which can really help us at this critical time when we are doing so much to destroy it? There are reasons to doubt it: Buddha lived in a very different time and place, Iron Age India. But the Buddha did know about dukkha, the term usually translated as 'suffering'‚Äö yet to be understood in the broadest sense: dissatisfaction, discontent, anxiety‚Äö basically, our manifest inability to be happy, which does not mean that life is always miserable but that even those who are wealthy and healthy experience a dis-ease that keeps gnawing. That we find life frustrating, one damn problem after another, is not accidental, because it is the nature of an unawakened mind to be bothered about something. What, if anything, does that imply about the ecological crisis? This presentation will point out the precise and profound parallels between our usual individual predicament, according to Buddhism, and the present situation of human civilization. This suggests that the eco-crisis is as much a spiritual challenge as a technological and economic one.

These theories identify a single universal, unified field at the basis of all forms and phenomena in the universe. At the same time, cutting-edge research in the field of neuroscience has revealed the existence of a unified field of consciousness‚Äö a fourth major state of human consciousness, which is physiologically and subjectively distinct from waking, dreaming and deep sleep. In this meditative state, the threefold structure of waking experience‚Äö the observer, the observed and the process of observation‚Äö are united in one indivisible wholeness of pure consciousness.\r\n\r\nThese parallel discoveries of a unified field of physics and a unified field of consciousness raise fundamental questions concerning the relationship between the two. We present compelling theoretical and experimental evidence that the unified field of physics and the unified field of consciousness are identical‚Äö i.e. that during the meditative state, human awareness directly experiences the unified field at the foundation of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe show that the proposed identity between consciousness and the unified field may indeed be required to account for experimentally observed field effects of consciousness. We present the findings of a National Demonstration Project‚Äö the largest controlled sociological experiment in history‚Äö in which 4,000 advanced meditators markedly reduced violent crime in Washington, DC. We briefly explore the practical applications of proven meditative procedures for developing total brain functioning, higher states of consciousness‚Äö preventing social conflict and promoting peace on a national and global scale.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fqdcdky9wR4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fqdcdky9wR4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fqdcdky9wR4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fqdcdky9wR4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fqdcdky9wR4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":958,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Fqdcdky9wR4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WZ_NiMhcyHD4eLpQhurlsxa6Qy4","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnZzQ1p5cXQwMGJZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-12-15T00:43:07Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Visualizing Cosmic Models: A Situated Approach, David McConville - SAND 2011","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\r\n\r\nDavid McConville - Dir of Noospheric research -- The Elumenati\r\n\r\nModels of the cosmos profoundly influence our interpretations of reality, shaping the lenses through which we perceive the world.

These theories identify a single universal, unified field at the basis of all forms and phenomena in the universe. At the same time, cutting-edge research in the field of neuroscience has revealed the existence of a unified field of consciousness‚Äö a fourth major state of human consciousness, which is physiologically and subjectively distinct from waking, dreaming and deep sleep. In this meditative state, the threefold structure of waking experience‚Äö the observer, the observed and the process of observation‚Äö are united in one indivisible wholeness of pure consciousness.\r\n\r\nThese parallel discoveries of a unified field of physics and a unified field of consciousness raise fundamental questions concerning the relationship between the two. We present compelling theoretical and experimental evidence that the unified field of physics and the unified field of consciousness are identical‚Äö i.e. that during the meditative state, human awareness directly experiences the unified field at the foundation of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe show that the proposed identity between consciousness and the unified field may indeed be required to account for experimentally observed field effects of consciousness. We present the findings of a National Demonstration Project‚Äö the largest controlled sociological experiment in history‚Äö in which 4,000 advanced meditators markedly reduced violent crime in Washington, DC. We briefly explore the practical applications of proven meditative procedures for developing total brain functioning, higher states of consciousness‚Äö preventing social conflict and promoting peace on a national and global scale.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjNjxDtLOjk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjNjxDtLOjk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjNjxDtLOjk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjNjxDtLOjk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjNjxDtLOjk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":960,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xjNjxDtLOjk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"36UrkSr6clt9vGTp6A8ih3bgKwk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnRsUVlUSG9lYkQ0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-12-07T22:28:25Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Q&A with Puppetji at SAND 2011","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\n\nSAND in house guru, Puppetji, answers questions from the audience.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlQYTHoebD4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlQYTHoebD4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlQYTHoebD4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlQYTHoebD4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tlQYTHoebD4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":961,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tlQYTHoebD4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"F_XHsjFCdRz4ZHWH1bf01c89Ia8","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LldsaVdXWVVQb0Fj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-12-07T21:01:26Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Sound of One Hand Laughing.

Michael Bernard Beckwith says, \"David's performance is actually a transformance which assists in breaking barriers so one may experience the excellence within.\" As a performer, humorist, author, and speaker, he's inspired a quarter of a million people worldwide to laugh and uncover a boundless sense of being - from The United Nations Society of Enlightenment and Transformation, to Mother Theresa's orphanage. At an early age, he studied how to create worlds in space and silence through the ancient art form of pantomime under the teaching of a Kabbalah master. David is known for his physically hilarious performance skills, enlightened characters, and astute commentary on this human adventure of remembering who we really are. His new book, The Ocean of Now focuses on the boundless benefits and joy of living in the present moment.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WliWWYUPoAc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WliWWYUPoAc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WliWWYUPoAc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WliWWYUPoAc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WliWWYUPoAc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":962,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WliWWYUPoAc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"3i8hoK0yTmwDCQ6fKzfptdzSkV4","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmUwREV2RktmYVhr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-11-23T17:53:32Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"A Cosmology of Connection: Poetry, Justice and Nonduality - Drew Dellinger, SAND11","description":"http://www.scienceandnonduality.com\nClip from Drew Dellinger's talk at Science and Nonduality Conference 2011 on \"A Cosmology of Connection: Poetry, Justice and Nonduality\".

Discontentment, suffering, and pervasive dissatisfaction are 'hard-wired' intrinsic deep structures that appear to us from early human and pre-human evolutionary realms. Those early hominids that mated or ate and then rested on their laurels were less likely to past their genes on to future generations than those who kept on going, never feeling satisfied, mating, eating and wanting more. In a very real sense, the current human organism is the living, genetic heritage of all that. We think, it's my unhappiness, but it's much more impersonal than that. It's all of ours, and to the extent we accept this, which is Buddha's truth, is to the extent we start to become free of it. That's why it's called a Truth--- it's not something to be overlooked---and why the 1st and 2nd Noble Truths precede the deep realizations offered by the 3rd and 4th Noble Truths. In other words, it's hard to \"wake up\" to non-dual awareness when you're still doing battle with your humanness.\"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sK9IP4ODSDE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sK9IP4ODSDE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sK9IP4ODSDE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":968,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sK9IP4ODSDE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"F7ykJUL61ndBOUxS2KnHdDKV_PM","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LjZBdVFQcUpQU0tF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-08-22T02:25:11Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"The Symphony of Time","description":"A musical celebration of the concept of Time. http://www.scienceandnonduality.com/\r\n\r\nFeaturing Dean Radin, Robert Lanza,  Maurizio Benazzo, Alan Watts, Michio Kaku, Brian Cox,\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPHONY OF TIME (lyrics) \r\nOur experience of time is an illusion; there is no clock out there in the world.\r\nNo Clock, keeping time!\r\nNo Clock, out there in the world!\r\nSpace and time are tools of our understanding.\r\nTime is just a concept, an illusion, a construct of the mind.\r\nThe concept of the time, creates what we call the self.\r\nWhat is the I without time?\r\nThe only reason for time to exist is so everything does not happen at once.\r\nYour mind has the capacity to put this together and add to what's going on.\r\nTime is like a super glue keeping our story in order while we navigate the world around us.\r\nWhile we navigate the world around us!\r\nScience says that's space and time are these whole external objects.\r\nWhat we need to do is readjust the way of thinking.\r\nThe concept of time creates what we call the self, what is the I without time?\r\nThe concept of time, creates what we call the self, what is the I without time?\r\nFor all human beings time is a matter of extraordinary importance and perhaps this is one of the principle ways in which we differ from animals.\r\nTime drives every second of our lives in ways we can scarcely imagine.\r\nIs one of the greatest mysteries in all of nature!\r\nIt's time that makes us uniquely human and it's knitted into the fabric of our being.\r\nTime is also intimate.

We therefore observe this nothingness and it is our mind that gives it the appearance of solidity.  Which is the conclusions reached by mystics trough the ages. Maybe it is not a nonduality of matter but a nonduality of consciousness we should explore.\r\n\r\nThe new hard question is not how brain gives rise to consciousness but how do our minds take on all the different forms that we experience as reality?\r\n\r\nThe nondual perspective to this question is that all is one, there is no difference between form and emptiness, mind and matter.\r\n\r\nCould this nondual prospective heal the split between science and spirituality?","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ltZMVJPljg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ltZMVJPljg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ltZMVJPljg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ltZMVJPljg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ltZMVJPljg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":1001,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3ltZMVJPljg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"8Y_6XARKvoofrD1DxmrcGTN8BUk","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LkYteHVKeURFVHdv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2010-07-24T02:10:10Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Beyond the \"I\"?","description":"Robert Dittler will be leading a workshop on \"Reacquainting with The (Nondual) Mind of a Child\" at Science and Nonduality Conference, October 20, 2010, San Rafael, CA","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-xuJyDETwo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-xuJyDETwo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-xuJyDETwo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-xuJyDETwo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-xuJyDETwo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":1002,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"F-xuJyDETwo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"x9fr-TKBdXeN7NxwkSQ7PMpq2_Q","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LmdJa3ZfMUNXdkhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2010-07-23T20:59:30Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Who is aware?","description":"Robert Dittler will be leading a workshop on \"Reacquainting with The (Nondual) Mind of a Child\" at Science and Nonduality Conference, October 20, 2010, San Rafael, CA","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gIkv_1CWvHo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gIkv_1CWvHo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gIkv_1CWvHo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gIkv_1CWvHo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gIkv_1CWvHo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":1003,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gIkv_1CWvHo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dF3bwvwzFKY-w8WAKu-sX4VbK7U","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53LnYtMmIycUFMVk1n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2010-07-12T01:57:34Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"Invitation to Science and Nonduality Conference 2010","description":"www.ScienceAndNonduality.com\r\nInvitation to Science and Nonduality Conference 2010 by Maurizio&Zaya Benazzo.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-2b2qALVMg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-2b2qALVMg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-2b2qALVMg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-2b2qALVMg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-2b2qALVMg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","playlistId":"UUG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","position":1004,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"v-2b2qALVMg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Science and Nonduality","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4GIOEmf6uYS58gzc8hSLEpCWmOU","id":"VVVHOV8zTVAzMC1QREFNdUV0ZThIVU53Lk5RNHJxNEVVSkxj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2010-07-03T02:21:51Z","channelId":"UCG9_3MP30-PDAMuEte8HUNw","title":"AN EXTRAORDINARY ABSENCE trailer - Jeff Foster","description":"www.NetiNetiMedia.com\r\n\r\nIf you think that 'awakening' is a special state reserved only for enlightened masters and gurus, then think again...\r\n\r\nIn an intimate series of interviews filmed exclusively for this DVD, Jeff Foster shares the timeless message of non-separation in a simple, human and down-to-earth way. He invites you to forget everything you know, everything you've ever been taught, everything you've ever read about 'spiritual awakening', 'Oneness', 'enlightenment', 'nonduality' and 'Advaita', and to consider a new possibility: the possibility of absolute freedom, right now, right here in the midst of this very ordinary life. The possibility that you were never for one moment separate from life, and that at the heart of experience there is an intimacy beyond words.\r\n\r\nJeff is not affiliated with any spiritual path, teacher, tradition or lineage. He sees that truth - that which is present and alive - is absolutely free and cannot be captured by any religion, ideology, philosophy or belief system. However, perhaps it can be shared, in friendship and openness, with those who are ready to go beyond their ideas, concepts and beliefs, and discover who they really are.\r\n\r\n'This DVD is a love letter to the exhausted spiritual seeker who is simply longing to come Home.'","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQ4rq4EUJLc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQ4rq4EUJLc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQ4rq4EUJLc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQ4rq4EUJLc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQ4rq4EUJLc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Science
