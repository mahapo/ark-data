artistically"},{"startMs":491699,"durationMs":3981,"subtitle":"interesting in the beginning

I"},{"startMs":499259,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"think that it was more of this personal"},{"startMs":501660,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"practice to"},{"startMs":504419,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"um understand my own suffering and or or"},{"startMs":507360,"durationMs":9720,"subtitle":"do something about it that was I think"},{"startMs":512399,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"probably felt us anxiety or this uh"},{"startMs":517080,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"floating thing and that I was feeling uh"},{"startMs":521279,"durationMs":4581,"subtitle":"then"},{"startMs":522320,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"always Zen and Buddhism has been"},{"startMs":525860,"durationMs":4539,"subtitle":"epistemically interesting for me in"},{"startMs":528180,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"relationship to the philosophical part"},{"startMs":530399,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"and all that"},{"startMs":532019,"durationMs":7081,"subtitle":"um but it has been a progressive merging"},{"startMs":535920,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"probably in relationship to"},{"startMs":539100,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"um what what what it means and uh going"},{"startMs":543600,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"back a little bit to"},{"startMs":545640,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"in my own professional development I"},{"startMs":549120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"actually have a degree in Psychology and"},{"startMs":550860,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"cognitive science so

different"},{"startMs":556500,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"whatever I'm doing and different"},{"startMs":558180,"durationMs":6719,"subtitle":"instantiations of trying to

influences"},{"startMs":575519,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"in my work"},{"startMs":577519,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"and then probably with the time and the"},{"startMs":580500,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"Aging"},{"startMs":581660,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"I've been"},{"startMs":583580,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"enjoying the benefits of

ongoing"},{"startMs":625440,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"practice"},{"startMs":627660,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"um and then it became more obvious when"},{"startMs":630660,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"I was going on retreats"},{"startMs":633660,"durationMs":6359,"subtitle":"yeah so and then I think in 2014

is"},{"startMs":684420,"durationMs":5359,"subtitle":"consciousness and"},{"startMs":686880,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"um and included
