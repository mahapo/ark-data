uh"},{"startMs":558779,"durationMs":4861,"subtitle":"adapt to it so sometimes I just describe"},{"startMs":561720,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"it as if you if people know what a"},{"startMs":563640,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"clarinet is if you take the mouthpiece"},{"startMs":565620,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"off the clarinet take all the keys

to"},{"startMs":581820,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"to make it a little less of a sharp edge"},{"startMs":586440,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"um it's different wood though right"},{"startMs":589380,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"well these yeah and that's the other key"},{"startMs":591120,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"feature is that this is this is bamboo"},{"startMs":593040,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and it's a root end bamboo which is a"},{"startMs":595260,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"development that it's a little"},{"startMs":597240,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"mysterious when that started happening"},{"startMs":599279,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"but it's a very cool aspect"},{"startMs":601980,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"um in terms of the lower end what would"},{"startMs":604260,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"be the bell of the

ground"},{"startMs":612480,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"so it's it's pretty fun to both just"},{"startMs":615000,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"sort of stare at that and be in"},{"startMs":617399,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"amazement at that physical part you know"},{"startMs":620940,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"nature constructed

bamboo"},{"startMs":642540,"durationMs":3979,"subtitle":"so yeah the bamboo aspect for me is a"},{"startMs":645000,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"big"},{"startMs":646519,"durationMs":2621,"subtitle":"aspect"},{"startMs":648480,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":649140,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"to

because"},{"startMs":765660,"durationMs":6479,"subtitle":"for one thing the the didge has no"},{"startMs":769620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"finger holes right so it's a it's a"},{"startMs":772139,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"single fundamental based tube whereas"},{"startMs":775500,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"our tube has a couple not many not

standard"},{"startMs":780300,"durationMs":3779,"subtitle":"flutes"},{"startMs":781560,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"yeah normal is not something I normally"},{"startMs":784079,"durationMs":5161,"subtitle":"say but uh yeah so more common let's say"},{"startMs":787440,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"flutes are going to have six or seven"},{"startMs":789240,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"finger holes to get your diatonic scales"},{"startMs":792360,"durationMs":5219,"subtitle":"we have five finger holes and one

holes"},{"startMs":799920,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"so that means okay where are the other"},{"startMs":801480,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"eight notes if the chromatic scale going"},{"startMs":803639,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"to come from but that's a sort of a"},{"startMs":805260,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"separate question it's already got"},{"startMs":806639,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"finger holes so it's designed"},{"startMs":808380,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"essentially to do melodic stuff as well"},{"startMs":810600,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"as you could do drones"},{"startMs":813120,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"um uh once you start circular breathing"},{"startMs":815820,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"which is something I do it's also not"},{"startMs":818399,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"super common on shakachi but

out"},{"startMs":840120,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"one little sound so circular breathing"},{"startMs":842700,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"and a constancy of tone and this"},{"startMs":846060,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"Elemental quality to the tone that's"},{"startMs":847860,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"also something I feel like we have in"},{"startMs":849660,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"common"},{"startMs":850380,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"uh but the tone production method is uh"},{"startMs":853740,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"it shares with brass instruments it's a"},{"startMs":856320,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"lip Buzz tone production yeah"},{"startMs":859800,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"um which is very different than"},{"startMs":861240,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"generating"},{"startMs":862380,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"um an Airstream that is specifically"},{"startMs":864420,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"aligned with the edge of the tube which"},{"startMs":867060,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"is what flu fluting is so the tone"},{"startMs":870120,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"Productions are"},{"startMs":871620,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"vastly different and then how on"},{"startMs":874860,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"didgeridoo you're going to be layering"},{"startMs":876959,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"vertically it doesn't just play the"},{"startMs":879240,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"fundamental but you're you're basing the"},{"startMs":881279,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"fundamental and then pulling harmonics"},{"startMs":883620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"above that so you have a basically a"},{"startMs":886260,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"polyphony inside the tube happening"},{"startMs":889500,"durationMs":2699,"subtitle":"um which we could do a little bit of"},{"startMs":890820,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"that with harmonics but it's a little"},{"startMs":892199,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"more like other instruments in the sense"},{"startMs":894839,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"that you're changing pitches and doing"},{"startMs":897600,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"something that's Melody based not drone"},{"startMs":900600,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"based and could you uh just quickly"},{"startMs":903680,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"describe circular breathing for people"},{"startMs":905880,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"that might not be familiar with that"},{"startMs":907440,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"term"},{"startMs":908760,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"yeah so sometimes I had been saying this"},{"startMs":910860,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"is more properly called uh constant"},{"startMs":913440,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"exhale or something like this or"},{"startMs":915680,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"Perpetual exhale"},{"startMs":917820,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"we could say and so because of the way"},{"startMs":920100,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"the respiratory tract in the head in in"},{"startMs":923820,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"the nose and the mouth is

one"},{"startMs":957660,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and then breathe in note number two"},{"startMs":960480,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"that's called phrasing and and so that's"},{"startMs":963420,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"become the way that all wind instruments"},{"startMs":965820,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"are perceived as their primary

a"},{"startMs":985320,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"singer so a lot of melodic understanding"},{"startMs":987779,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"is based on either birds or singers
