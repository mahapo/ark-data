hole."},{"startMs":769666,"durationMs":3962,"subtitle":"Eventually, the villagers knocked the sheep out and dropped it into the hole."},{"startMs":773652,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"About halfway in, the sheep woke up and let out a terrifying scream."},{"startMs":778266,"durationMs":2547,"subtitle":"It continued for a while, then stopped."},{"startMs":780838,"durationMs":4303,"subtitle":"The villagers quickly retrieved the sheep, but Mel saw that it was dead."},{"startMs":785166,"durationMs":2629,"subtitle":"The cause of the death was unknown."},{"startMs":788209,"durationMs":2833,"subtitle":"Over the years, several theories have been put forth"},{"startMs":791067,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"to explain Mel's Hole mysteries."},{"startMs":793452,"durationMs":3452,"subtitle":"The first explanation was volcanic caves."},{"startMs":797028,"durationMs":4970,"subtitle":"Caves of various types and sizes can occur where volcanic rocks are exposed."},{"startMs":802023,"durationMs":3247,"subtitle":"They are created by flowing lava near the land's surface,"},{"startMs":805295,"durationMs":2762,"subtitle":"and are easily destroyed by erosion."},{"startMs":808157,"durationMs":4570,"subtitle":"The longest and most complex form of volcanic caves are lava tubes."},{"startMs":812752,"durationMs":2990,"subtitle":"They are formed from the courses of lava rivers"},{"startMs":815767,"durationMs":4291,"subtitle":"that formerly flowed downslope from a volcanic vent or fissure."},{"startMs":820083,"durationMs":4945,"subtitle":"Lava tubes form best in highly fluid lava, particularly basalt rock."},{"startMs":825361,"durationMs":3834,"subtitle":"The state of Washington rests on a highly active volcanic hotspot,"},{"startMs":829219,"durationMs":3842,"subtitle":"and it could be that Mel's Hole was a very resilient lava tube"},{"startMs":833086,"durationMs":1813,"subtitle":"formed thousands of years ago,"},{"startMs":834924,"durationMs":3766,"subtitle":"but that doesn't explain all the other strange occurrences in the hole."},{"startMs":838966,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"The second theory is connected to the Hollow Earth theory,"},{"startMs":842491,"durationMs":2899,"subtitle":"of which we have an entire 40-minute documentary"},{"startMs":845415,"durationMs":4551,"subtitle":"in which we present many scientific clues that support this theory."},{"startMs":850166,"durationMs":5134,"subtitle":"This is the idea that the Earth is hollow below a rather small layer of rock."},{"startMs":855452,"durationMs":1427,"subtitle":"Concerning Mel's Hole,"},{"startMs":856904,"durationMs":4905,"subtitle":"the idea is that the fishing line and items tossed in never seem to hit bottom"},{"startMs":861834,"durationMs":3613,"subtitle":"because the hole led to the empty interior of the planet."},{"startMs":865880,"durationMs":4724,"subtitle":"The next theory was the entire thing was some kind of secret government project."},{"startMs":870671,"durationMs":3665,"subtitle":"The fact that the pit was located near the Yakima Training Center"},{"startMs":874361,"durationMs":2258,"subtitle":"also made this story plausible."},{"startMs":876644,"durationMs":3084,"subtitle":"However, how come the government allowed people to discover"},{"startMs":879753,"durationMs":4475,"subtitle":"and use the hole as a garbage disposal unit for so many years?"},{"startMs":884595,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"On December 20, 2002,"},{"startMs":887280,"durationMs":4467,"subtitle":"Mel Waters appeared again on Coast to Coast AM for the last

the second hole"},{"startMs":898747,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"were communicating with some kind of interdimensional creature"},{"startMs":902472,"durationMs":2404,"subtitle":"that used the hole for communication."},{"startMs":904970,"durationMs":2230,"subtitle":"He claimed that the creature described itself as"},{"startMs":907224,"durationMs":2522,"subtitle":"capable of traveling through worlds,"},{"startMs":909771,"durationMs":2984,"subtitle":"and it issued a dire warning to humanity."},{"startMs":912780,"durationMs":4194,"subtitle":"The creature warned of the use of weapons using the power of two holes,"},{"startMs":916999,"durationMs":3315,"subtitle":"and that if we harness that power for military purposes,"},{"startMs":920339,"durationMs":1937,"subtitle":"we would destroy ourselves."},{"startMs":922301,"durationMs":3907,"subtitle":"It said that other beings on other planets were waiting for our destruction"},{"startMs":926233,"durationMs":2990,"subtitle":"so they could come in and resettle our planet."},{"startMs":929480,"durationMs":2672,"subtitle":"After this most strange and shocking broadcast,"},{"startMs":932177,"durationMs":3374,"subtitle":"nothing was heard about Mel Waters ever again."},{"startMs":935576,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"He didn't sell any books or plug any much."},{"startMs":938738,"durationMs":1533,"subtitle":"He just disappeared."},{"startMs":940914,"durationMs":3857,"subtitle":"The true location of Mel's Hole also remained a mystery."},{"startMs":944919,"durationMs":2813,"subtitle":"But what exactly was Mel's Hole?"},{"startMs":947757,"durationMs":4690,"subtitle":"Was it a top secret military project or some kind of time travel gate?"},{"startMs":952476,"durationMs":3036,"subtitle":"Or was it a portal to an alternate dimension"},{"startMs":955537,"durationMs":2676,"subtitle":"like the wormholes of quantum physics?"},{"startMs":958238,"durationMs":3384,"subtitle":"These are questions that may never be answered in our time,"},{"startMs":961647,"durationMs":2638,"subtitle":"not when all records of Mel Waters and the hole"},{"startMs":964310,"durationMs":2409,"subtitle":"may have been erased from history."},{"startMs":967076,"durationMs":3365,"subtitle":"Mel's inability to give concrete photographic evidence"},{"startMs":970466,"durationMs":2853,"subtitle":"also contributes to the mystery around this phenomenon,"},{"startMs":973344,"durationMs":4636,"subtitle":"and leaves many people to think that the entire thing is just a hoax."},{"startMs":978247,"durationMs":3372,"subtitle":"Tell
