May spent the first part of his research career in his chosen Ph.D. discipline, Low Energy, Experimental Nuclear Physics, which he earned in 1968 at the University of Pittsburgh. Before leaving that career, he had published 10 papers in the \npeer-reviewed physics literature including his report of the first measurement of the singlet state of the deuteron which appeared in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nHe became interested in serious research of psi phenomena in late 1975 when he joined the ongoing U.S. Government-sponsored work at SRI International (formerly called Stanford Research Institute). In 1985, he became that program’s director, but in 1991, he shifted the effort to Science Applications International  Corporation, another US Defense Contractor.  His  association with  the government-sponsored psi research ended in 1995, when the program, then called STAR GATE, was closed by the \nUS Government. \n\nWhen the research was finally declassified in 2000, Dr. May could publish ground-breaking results and theories in the peer-reviewed literature. \n\nDr. May has managed complex, interdisciplinary research projects for the US federal government since 1976. He presided over 70% of the funding ($20M) and 85% of the data collection for the government’s 22-year involvement in parapsychological research. \n\nDr. May and his colleague Dr. Sonali Bhatt Marwaha have published four-volumes of The Star Gate  Archives.  The  Honorable  William  S.  Cohen,  former  Secretary  of  Defense  in  the  Clinton administration, wrote a foreword to this collection.\n\n\nLinks:\n=======================\nhttps://www.lfr.org/lfr \n\n\nBooks:\n=======================\nA Link to the books; is here: https://www.lfr.org/book-store\n\nThe Star Gate Archives: Reports of the United States \nGovernment Sponsored Psi Program, 1972–1995.

I also didn’t want to add any new acronyms to the growing list of RV methods so I just called it by how it works – a flow.\n\nIt’s a remote viewing method born of Ingo Swann’s CRV, but one that promotes a symbiotic relationship with its practitioners that allows a flowing development of practitioner and method together. \n\nSo there you have it. Chris - that's why I write this on my RV. \n\n‘flow’ for me is at its core CRV but with a different way of thinking behind it, a different philosophy of its form, function, and its use by us as individuals. \n\nIt’s a remote viewing method born of Ingo Swann’s CRV, but one that promotes a relationship with its practitioners that allows a flowing development of practitioner and method together. \n\nI wish you all the very best on your RV journey.\nNamaste!\nDaz\n\nsources:\n====================================\nRemote viewing Methods map 2021 - https://www.remoteviewed.com/remote-viewing-methods-map/\n\nUniversity of West Georgia Ingo Swann archives. https://uwg.galileo.usg.edu/repositories/2/resources/274\n\nUWG Ingo Swann files documenting the progress of CRV R&D and training 1981-83\n\nJune 3, 2021 Did Ingo Swann Add More Stages to Controlled Remote Viewing? – https://wp.me/p71QFz-qk\n\n1985 – Tom McNear training notes – https://www.remoteviewed.com/crv-manuals/\n\nThe CRV training manuals and SRI documents - https://www.remoteviewed.com/crv-manuals/\n\nMen who stare at squiggles –The Ideogram Controversy - https://psi-unit.com/en/?p=3641\n\nNEW revised Open Source CRV guide (pdf download) - now renamed FLOW. - https://www.remoteviewed.com/crv-manuals/\n\n\n\n🚀Remote Viewing information:  ✅💥 https://www.remoteviewed.com/\n\n💥http://www.eightmartinis.com/ - FREE RV magazine\n💥https://signalline.podbean.com/ - Remote Viewing podcast\n💥https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers - join us on Facebook\n💥https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/ - join us on Reddit\n\nOTHER LINKS:\n=================================================\n💥What is Remote viewing? - https://www.remoteviewed.com/what-is-remote-viewing/\n\n💥A beginners guide to Remote Viewing - https://www.remoteviewed.com/a-beginners-guide-to-remote-viewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJLZUg9ujVY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJLZUg9ujVY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJLZUg9ujVY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJLZUg9ujVY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJLZUg9ujVY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sJLZUg9ujVY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fxG8Hyuno8C9WQQlRjlefSgnc38","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLmhZSzJ4VElROU9Z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-08-27T13:25:14Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing discussion with Michelle Freed 26 Aug 2022","description":"Todays video and chat was a two-part affair.

There is also a link to further information and a pdf download file of the manual itself. If anyone owns the copyright on this, email me. It says ©Prudence Calabrese and she left the field some years back.\n\nThe TDS Remote Viewing System - larger universe - 2002\nCreated by Prudence Calabrese.\n\nThe TransDimensional approach to controlled remote viewing is unapologetically progressive. We've taken our own and other viewer's subjective experiences, the extensive and objective knowledge gained from our work with training and advanced viewer development at The Farsight Institute, and what has been done in the RV field specifically and generally since Ingo Swann's original conception of RV, as informed vantage points for taking a fresh look at how controlled remote viewing seems to work in general. Of course, the more one figures out how something works on the use level, the more leads there are to discovering what is happening on the level of scientific principle.\n\nThere is also a wealth of evidence to be culled from the entire body of psi research and anecdotal accounts of \"paranormal\" visions. From all these diverse sources, scientific and anecdotal, we have developed a substantially revised system of those physical and mental routines which a viewer utilizes to access and describe a given target. It has entirely new components as well. But what we think really sets it apart is the dynamism that the parts give to the whole. It is dynamic in several important respects. In fact, we almost dubbed it Dynamically Controlled Remote Viewing, but decided that that should be an actual sub-category of controlled remote viewing.

It is dynamic in several important respects. First of all, numerous techniques and tools are discretionary, being used in response to the nature of the objective (target) particulars, the style of the viewer, and the level of information that the viewer or tasker wants to obtain. This means that the process of remote viewing can be more intuitive, flexible, and efficient, yet there is no loss of structure or clarity. Secondly, many system components are intentionally devised so that, over the course of time, a given viewer can gradually consolidate, customize, or even discard sub-components to make the whole process more natural. In many cases, these components would then only exist in the viewer's psyche as mnemonic templates for data-gathering routines.\n\nFor further details and a download of the TDS remote viewing method - click here: https://www.remoteviewed.com/tds-manuals/\n\nRemote Viewing from the Ground Up - Book - Jon Knowles - https://is.gd/OjCLqy\n\nJohn Vivanco TDS trainer - https://www.righthemispheric.com/\n\n\n\n🚀Remote Viewing information:  ✅💥 https://www.remoteviewed.com/\n\n💥http://www.eightmartinis.com/ - FREE RV magazine\n💥https://signalline.podbean.com/ - Remote Viewing podcast\n💥https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers - join us on Facebook\n💥https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/ - join us on Reddit\n\nOTHER LINKS:\n=================================================\n💥What is Remote viewing? - https://www.remoteviewed.com/what-is-remote-viewing/\n\n💥A beginners guide to Remote Viewing - https://www.remoteviewed.com/a-beginners-guide-to-remote-viewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOltosN_tzA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOltosN_tzA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOltosN_tzA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOltosN_tzA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOltosN_tzA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":18,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KOltosN_tzA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dve2eSJuh1zuYvaPBEJ7iYG18lQ","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLmlQMmpYVDlXYU1Z","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-16T22:42:41Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"TDS - Part 6   Matrix Procedures","description":"Note from Remoteviewed: In an effort to record and keep as many remote viewing resources as we can in one central location, I have added the seven-disk TDS remote viewing videos created and owned by Prudence Calabrese to this youtube channel.

So Dick and myself took the info and created this short film as we felt it important to share.\n\nRemote viewer Daz Smith sets out on an incredible journey as he works a blind remote viewing target for the Farsight Institute. He's told nothing more than \"this is target 14-A,\" but finds himself witnessing the John F. Kennedy assassination, and Kennedy's transformation at his moment of physical death. This video gives an inside look at the remote viewing process and a dramatic example of where it can take you.\n\nThe Farsight original DVD set part1 and 2 are free on youtube here:\nhttps://youtu.be/GAXrZl96S20\nhttps://youtu.be/9Ka_vjCU-qg\n\nThe Remote-Viewing Targets for This Project:\n\nPart 1: The Shooters:\nThe viewer will remote view the assassination of John F. Kennedy as it occurred in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Friday, November 22, 1963. The viewer will perceive the assassination itself in all of its complexity as well as any preparatory activity immediately prior to the assassination that may be related to the assassination.\n\nPart 2: The Organizers\nThe viewer will remote view the highest level organizational and planning meeting that orchestrated the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The viewer will perceive the individuals involved in the meeting, the thoughts and emotions of those individuals, and the hierarchical structure around which those involved in the assassination are organized.\n\nNote: The above target descriptions were given to the remote viewers only AFTER all of the remote viewing was completed and delivered for this project.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDT3_iXIUhM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDT3_iXIUhM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDT3_iXIUhM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDT3_iXIUhM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDT3_iXIUhM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"uDT3_iXIUhM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"24aJ5YdfogYJz1SpMOfA3xPGCFg","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLnpid0I1a3NROTdR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-27T18:40:23Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing discussions - Dick Allgire answers questions about the HRVG methodology.","description":"Dick Allgire was a television newscaster for 34 years. In 1996 he became interested in remote viewing. He trained in SRV at The Farsight Institute, learned from Ed Dames and studied TRV. Dick also studied the CRV manual. In 1997 he began in classroom training with The Hawaii Remote Viewers’ Guild.\n\nThat weekly in-house training lasted 18 years, and the research and development continues to this day. Allgire is probably the most published remote viewer in the world. Not that he is the best; but in terms of showing actual work performed under blind conditions, there are literally hundreds of examples of printed and videotaped published sessions. Dick has been a featured speaker and master of ceremonies at numerous IRVA conferences. His presentations included, “A Method For Determining Location In Remote Viewing,” “An Introduction To Consensus Analysis,” “An Introduction To The HRVG Method,” “Masking and Entrainment,” and “A Message To The Past.” Allgire is currently a full-time paid professional remote viewer for “Cryptoviewing.”\n\nCryptoviewing: https://www.patreon.com/cryptoviewing\nHRVG: https://hrvg.org/\n\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links: \n===========================================\nThe Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/\nDaz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nSignal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTf\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbwB5ksQ97Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbwB5ksQ97Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbwB5ksQ97Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbwB5ksQ97Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbwB5ksQ97Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":37,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zbwB5ksQ97Q"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"y6HQEUvx5IGsKHKNntB-8Rg3tW0","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLk1GeUZ6SXdleHhZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-23T10:17:20Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing the Nimitz TIC TAC UAP encounter.","description":"This project was a BLIND remote viewing target tasked to the remote viewing group Hellfire in September 2021.

If anyone owns the copyright on this, email me. It says ©Prudence Callabrese  and she left the feild some years back.\n\nThe TDS Remote Viewing System - larger universe - 2002\nCreated by Prudence Callabrese.\n\nThe TransDimensional approach to controlled remote viewing is unapologetically progressive. We've taken our own and other viewer's subjective experiences, the extensive and objective knowledge gained from our work with training and advanced viewer development at The Farsight Institute, and what has been done in the RV field specifically and generally since Ingo Swann's original conception of RV, as informed vantage points for taking a fresh look at how controlled remote viewing seems to work in general. Of course, the more one figures out how something works on the use-level, the more leads there are to discovering what is happening on the level of scientific principle.\n\nhere is also a wealth of evidence to be culled from the entire body of psi research and anecdotal accounts of \"paranormal\" visions. From all these diverse sources, scientific and anecdotal, we have developed a substantially revised system of those physical and mental routines which a viewer utilizes to access and describe a given target. It has entirely new components as well. But what we think really sets it apart is the dynamism which the parts give to the whole. It is dynamic in several important respects. In fact, we almost dubbed it Dynamically Controlled Remote Viewing, but decided that that should be an actual sub-category of controlled remote viewing. Instead, we call it the TransDimensional Remote Viewing System, or TDRVS for \"short.\" (We honestly don't like acronyms, but they do make it easier to write a sentence!)\n\nThe TDRV system is a complex of integrated, progressive, and hierarchical techniques and tools. It is dynamic in several important respects. First of all, numerous techniques and tools are discretionary, being used in response to the nature of the objective (target) particulars, the style of the viewer, and the level of information which the viewer or tasker wants to obtain. This means that the process of remote viewing can be more intuitive, flexible and efficient, yet there is no loss of structure or clarity. Secondly, many system components are intentionally devised so that, over the course of time, a given viewer can gradually consolidate, customize, or even discard sub-components to make the whole process more natural. In many cases, these components would then only exist in the viewers psyche as mnemonic templates for data-gathering routines.\n\nFor further details and a download of the TDS remote viewing method - click here: https://www.remoteviewed.com/tds-manuals/\n\nRemote Viewing from the Ground Up - Book - Jon Knowles - https://is.gd/OjCLqy\n\nJohn Vivanco TDS trainer - https://www.righthemispheric.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kK6iJdpZVY0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kK6iJdpZVY0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kK6iJdpZVY0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kK6iJdpZVY0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kK6iJdpZVY0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":47,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kK6iJdpZVY0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"cdsEqL9BFAVx8HoKGGW_LSUWAgQ","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLmNpdngzYzhuRlBN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-09-05T12:07:03Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"A community Remote viewing chat with Joseph McMoneagle on friday 3 September 2021.","description":"Commonly known as Viewer no.001 or 372.

Its great to see another group of mixed RV method (CRV/TDS/TRV/ERV) remote viewers working together, and publishing full projects showing their Rv data.\n\nThe BLIND Target - from my online (Target monkey) pool was: \nPhobos II satellite loss, March 27 1989'\n\nCue: Move to the optimum position/location and describe the event as it unfolds. Describe the event that led to the loss of the satellite.\n\n**Background:**\n\nPhobos ll arrived in January 1989 and entered an orbit around Mars as the first phase towards its real destination, a small Martian moon called Phobos.\n\nThe mission was flawless until the craft aligned itself with the moon.\n\nOn March 28, 1989 an elliptical object was detected moving towards the satellite seconds before it failed. \n\nOn March 31, 1989, headlines dispatched by the Moscow correspondents of the European News Agency (EFE) stated:\n\n\"Phobos 2 Captured Strange Photos of Mars Before Losing Contact With Its Base.\"\n\nSoviet News magazine Vremya revealed yesterday that the space probe Phobos II, which was orbiting above Mars when Soviet scientists lost contact with it on Monday, had photographed an UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT on the Martian surface seconds before losing contact.\"\n\nScientists described the UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT as a thin ellipse 20 KILOMETERS LONG!\n\nIt was further stated that the photos could not be an illusion because it was captured by 2 different color cameras as well as cameras taking infrared shots.\n\nOne controller at the Kaliningrad control center concluded that the probe was now spinning out of control. It would seem that something struck or shot the Phobos II Probe. \n\nThe full project details with ALL the remote viewing session data and the contact details for the remote viewers involved - can be seen here: https://www.rvprojects.hu/?p=40&fbclid=IwAR0EfTnV2N_yJrRASOiJDGtqiadoNPuMIC2YMDbP5FWaXf0t0L9WVRUwWkg\n\n\n**Daz recommended Remote Viewing links**\n===========================================\nThe Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/\nDaz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nSignal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTf\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxXGol8izlE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxXGol8izlE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxXGol8izlE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxXGol8izlE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxXGol8izlE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":54,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZxXGol8izlE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"bNAozAiXkAiAzavMI-sg--2Qd6A","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLjdsUGZwQ1pSMzJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-14T14:47:14Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing Open Community Chat - Aug 13, 2021","description":"Today's podcast was a community remote viewing discussion involving topics of: telepathic overlay, time, sketching in RV/CRV, stage5, mind maps, technology for RV, modelling in CRV, RV hints and tips and more.\n\nClick here for an explanation doc on how I Stage5 in RV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19REayU2cO7xJQk-QsRf3Db4exyUnkEGn/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links: \n===========================================\nThe Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/\nDaz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nSignal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTf\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lPfpCZR32A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lPfpCZR32A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lPfpCZR32A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lPfpCZR32A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lPfpCZR32A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":55,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7lPfpCZR32A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HhsnSoQ1K5cGaJaAo6YhAWHaVZI","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLnFPWUZqN2d6ZURJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-07T13:12:44Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Community Open Remote Viewing discussion Aug 6, 2021","description":"A great community chat with topics including: CRV history, ARV, methods, RV community issues, The Phobos II remote viewing project, student experiences working with Dr Ed May, stage 2 impressions, tips and advice and more.\n\nWhat is Remote viewing?

Corso in his book The Day after Roswell.\n\nThe BLIND tasking for this project was: \n5417-8651\nRoswell Silicon Chips – Purpose, Origin, & Impact\n\nTasking1. Viewer will describe the purpose and function of the silicon chips recovered form the Roswell crash, as reported by Colonel Philip J. Corso in his book The Day after Roswell.\n\nSubtasks:\n\n1. Viewer will identify the intelligence behind the creation of the silicon chips found at the Roswell crash. (*note ʹviewer is to focus on the original chips recovered, not any reproductions that may have been made)\n\n2. Viewer will describe the impacts this technology will have on human society.\n\n3. Viewer will describe the impacts this technology will have on human consciousness and physiology.Background:In 1997, Colonel Philip J. Corso released his book, “The Day After Roswell.” In his book, he claims to have worked for the Pentagon with the task of taking recovered debris from the Roswell Crash and covertly sending them to labs to be reverse engineered.\n\nWhen looking at the tiny silicon chips (integrated circuits), Corso speculated on the following possibility, which can be found in Chapter 12 of his book:It was as if from the year 1947 to 1980 a fundamental paradigm shift in the ability of humankind to process information took place. \n\nComputers themselves almost became something like a silicon-based lifeform, inspiring the carbon-based lifeforms on the planet Earth to develop them, grow them, and even help them reproduce. With computer-directed process-control programs now in place in virtually all major industries, software that writes software, neural-network-based expert systems that learn from their own experience in the real world, and current experiments under way to grow almost microscopically thin silicon-based chips in the weightless environment of earth orbit may be the forerunner of a time when automated orbital factories routinely grow and harvest new silicon material for microprocessors more sophisticated than we can even imagine at the present. Were all of this to be true, could it not be argued that the silicon wafers we recovered from Roswell were the real masters and space travellers and the EBE creatures their hosts or servants? \n\nOnce implanted successfully on Earth, our culture having reached a point of readiness through its development of the first digital computers, would not the natural development stream, starting from the invention of the transistor, have carried us to the point where we achieve a symbiotic relationship with the silicon material that carries our data and enables us to become more creative and successful? Maybe the Roswell crash, which helped us develop the technological basis for the weapons systems to protect our planet from the EBEs, was also the mechanism for successfully implanting a completely alien non-humanoid life-form that survives from host to host like a virus, a digital Ebola that we humans will carry to another planet someday. Or what if an enemy wanted to implant the perfect spying or sabotage mechanism into a culture? Then the implantation of the microchip-based circuit into our technology by the EBEs would be the perfect method. Was it implanted as sabotage or as something akin to the gift of fire? Maybe the Roswell crash in 1947 was an event waiting to happen, like poisoned fruit dropping from the tree into a playground. Once bitten, the poison takes effect.\n\nThe Full paper remote viewing session reports are here:https://www.remoteviewed.com/hellfire-club-remote-viewing-the-roswell-crash-silicon-chips/\n\nDennis Nappi II and his podcasts and more can be found here: https://is.gd/B76wHu\n\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links: youtube:===========================================The Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/Daz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/Eight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/Signal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTfFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewersReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlEAhgyp7TE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlEAhgyp7TE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlEAhgyp7TE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlEAhgyp7TE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlEAhgyp7TE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":57,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QlEAhgyp7TE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"CgYJCkalJgrdCX0MTjrTFVfV9II","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLkx2Ml9HUDRvaFlV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-07-31T12:36:41Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Associate remote viewing AMA with Debra Lynne Katz.","description":"Associate remote viewing AMA with Debra Lynne Katz.\nRecorded 30 July, 2021.\n\nDebra Lynne Katz, has a Ph.D in psychology with an emphasis in human consciousness and society and holds a Masters's Degree in Social Work. \n\nShe is also the Director of the International School of Clairvoyance, one of the first schools of its kind to offer successful distance training programs via teleseminar and webinar. \n\nDebra is an accomplished clairvoyant, remote viewer, medium and energy healer who works for some of the leading business manufactures, stockbrokers, and whose clientele include some of the top celebrities in the nation. \n\nShe has been conducting remote viewing and parapsychological research for a number of years and worked/studied in the Ingo Swann remote viewing archives for three years at the University of West Georgia. \n\nShe is the author of the landmark books: \"The Complete Clairvoyant; A Trilogy\"; \"You Are Psychic: The Art of Clairvoyant Reading and Healing\"; \"Extraordinary Psychic: Proven Techniques to Master Your Natural Abilities\";  and \"Freeing the Genie Within\".

Because of his skills, he quickly became a professional Remote Viewer and Director of Operations for one of the few successful civilian remote viewing think tanks to date – Trans Dimensional Systems.\n\nHe remote viewed and ran teams of remote viewers on client projects; from the technology and financial sector, to counter-terror for the FBI, and some mysterious projects for other alphabet agencies.\n\nAfter closing down in the early 2000’s due to death threats, and continual harassment by a covert group intent on shutting the business down, John turned his focus to pursuing his interest in TV and media, while still running a team of Remote Viewers, and training under RightHemispheric.\n\nHe worked with National Geographic on a number of projects. He also appears on the History Channel’s, Ancient Aliens and William Shatner’s The UnXplained, as well as other TV Networks like The Travel Channel. \n\n\nhttps://www.righthemispheric.com/\n\n\nWhat is Remote viewing? - https://www.remoteviewed.com/what-is-remote-viewing/ \n\nA beginners guide to Remote Viewing - https://www.remoteviewed.com/a-beginners-guide-to-remote-viewing/\n\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links: youtube:\n===========================================\nThe Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/\nDaz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nSignal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTf\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcSebeGOpts/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcSebeGOpts/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcSebeGOpts/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcSebeGOpts/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcSebeGOpts/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":61,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pcSebeGOpts"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fMxOu-i0JcwqE3Vhp8_3YL2e8tY","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLlNVb2hMMDlMbTFJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-07-10T13:27:17Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote viewing community discussion 9 July, 2021.","description":"Remote viewing community discussion 9 July, 2021.\n\nA great discussion with a little heated debate on great topics like: CRV, tasker intent, telepathy, project management, is accuracy needed? and many more...\n\nWhat is Remote viewing? - https://www.remoteviewed.com/what-is-remote-viewing/ \n\nA beginners guide to Remote Viewing - https://www.remoteviewed.com/a-beginners-guide-to-remote-viewing/\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links: youtube:\n===========================================\nThe Signal Line - Remote viewing podcasts: https://signalline.podbean.com/\nDaz RV Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nSignal Remote viewing group - https://signal.group/#CjQKIIN--u8ZZzJhcC5ZMvJxcEcYA0EyRUHE_XPZsvX3Sj1CEhB6LCOYYVTiBiKNVGmtRNTf\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/\nRussell Pickering's Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJY9HNjfRd8uvGtwuKd_cA","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUohL09Lm1I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUohL09Lm1I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUohL09Lm1I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUohL09Lm1I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SUohL09Lm1I/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":62,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SUohL09Lm1I"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZZpCrjvdajNFvmFSsFriWURoacI","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLnBXc0VGclNzQ2pr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-07-04T13:03:46Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"A remote viewing community discussion with David Oates about reverse speech.","description":"Recorded on July 2, 2021.\n\nDavid John Oates was born in rural Australia on October 30th 1955, the first born son of a young Methodist minister.

Six remote viewers blindly worked this target knowing only that our topic of targets in this group involved mysteries.\n\nFrederick Valentich was an Australian pilot who disappeared while on a 125-nautical-mile training flight in a Cessna 182L light aircraft, over Bass Strait on the evening of Saturday 21 October 1978.\n\nValentich radioed Melbourne air traffic control at 7:06 pm to report that an unidentified aircraft was following him at 4,500 feet (1,400 m). He was told there was no known traffic at that level. Valentich said he could see a large unknown aircraft which appeared to be illuminated by four bright landing lights. He was unable to confirm its type, but said it had passed about 1,000 feet (300 m) overhead and was moving at high speed. Valentich then reported that the aircraft was approaching him from the east and said the other pilot might be purposely toying with him. Valentich said the aircraft was \"orbiting\" above him and that it had a shiny metal surface and a green light on it. Valentich further reported that he was experiencing engine problems. Asked to identify the aircraft, Valentich radioed, \"It's not an aircraft.\"\n\nThis has been a case I have followed for thirty years - but to be honest there is not much to follow as fed, or his plane have never been found. Full disclosure - based on the available evidence - primarily the last conversation Fred had with air traffic control - my pre-intent for this target was that this was most probably a UFO encounter. Other than that I had no other expectations what-so-ever.\n\nOK, so take a look at the viewers as hey summarise their data in this video - then feel free to download and view the 320 pages of remote viewing data and make your own opinion of what you think may have happened that day.\n\nThe full 320 page remote viewing sessions can be downloaded here: https://www.remoteviewed.com/remote-viewing-the-fred-valentich-incident/\n\nThe intro for this video was given with permission from: \nDREAD: THE UNSOLVED Special Edition – “The Flight Beyond” They can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/c/DreadCentral/videos","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykfbh5d4afI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykfbh5d4afI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykfbh5d4afI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykfbh5d4afI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ykfbh5d4afI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":70,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ykfbh5d4afI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"5x6c8hywd5WMMuF77UsJEUcWU_8","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLjIxa0ZlaE01aklB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-05-15T12:36:06Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote viewing AMA with John Herlosky, 14 May, 2021.","description":"John Herlosky is the author of: A Sorcerer's Apprentice: A Skeptic's Journey into the CIA's Project Stargate and Remote Viewing.

Remote Viewing project","description":"The Georgia Guide stones and its message. Remote Viewing project\n\nThe Target: In Elbert County, Georgia there’s a set of stones called the Georgia Guide stones. They were put there in 1979, with a set of ten guidelines, in eight modern languages and four dead ones, carved onto the slabs. But that’s pretty much all anybody can agree on about them.\n\nNot only were the stones supposed to give messages, but their arrangement was meant to be a Stonehenge like astronomical device. Sullivan writes that the man commissioned to build them had to seek outside help to make that dream a reality:\n\nThe astrological specifications for the Guide stones were so complex that Fendley had to retain the services of an astronomer from the University of Georgia to help implement the design. The four outer stones were to be oriented based on the limits of the sun’s yearly migration. The centre column needed two precisely calibrated features: a hole through which the North Star would be visible at all times, and a slot that was to align with the position of the rising sun during the solstices and equinoxes. The principal component of the capstone was a 7\\8-inch aperture through which a beam of sunlight would pass at noon each day, shining on the center stone to indicate the day of the year.\n\nIn May of 2020, Edward Riordan tasked Daz Smith with one specific message from the Guidestones that he wanted information on:\n\n“UNITE HUMANITY WITH A LIVING NEW LANGUAGE”.\n\nThe video and Daz's paper Remote Viewing sessions show how Daz delves into some very strange topics including; esoteric symbolism, the quantum world, sound and wave communication and much more, all set in motion by a group on non physical entities with a message for mankind and its future.\n\nThe paper remote viewing session can be found here: https://www.remoteviewed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Georiga-guidestones-RV-Session-Daz-final.pdf\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links:\n===========================================\nDaz Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - FREE Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nWhatsapp group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVVpWa8JfBUHikCxKJvjGw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nTelegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Nvl6G1Q04YueN3q6i_t7Lg\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnWb3yBjATo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnWb3yBjATo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnWb3yBjATo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnWb3yBjATo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pnWb3yBjATo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":76,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pnWb3yBjATo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9gq773IAzSZBQaa-gNhEjpOx-h8","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLjFBekVkMnlmcjBj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-04-17T19:00:55Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Julia Mossbridge 16 April, 2021 on Love, Time Travel & remote  viewing.","description":"A remote Viewing community discussion with Julia Mossbridge, PhD is an Affiliate Prof. in Physics & Biophysics @ U.

As with ALL remote viewing - remember to evaluate the data using OTHER sources of information.\n\nOn the morning of June 30th, 1908, an explosion occurred in Siberia, Russia. It happened near the Stony Tunguska River in a sparsely populated area known as Eastern Siberian Taiga. Approximately 800 sq. miles, or more than 2,000 sq. kilometers were flattened.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the explosion. 30 million trees were flattened, and there was an area of approximately 200 sq. kilometers where the vegetation was burned. There have been many estimates of the force of the explosion, and they range from 10 to 90 Megatons. 15 megatons is about 1,000 greater than the nuclear explosion that destroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II.\n\nThere were approximately 700 witnesses, and they report seeing at least one object flying horizontally across the sky. Some evidence suggests there were two intersecting objects coming from different directions. There was a huge shock wave producing an impact on the ground that was similar to a 5.0 magnitude earthquake, using the standard Richter scale. Some of the witnesses, albeit distant from the explosion, were knocked off their feet by the shock wave as it travelled outward.\n\nThe target tasking for this project was:\nTarget #17: The viewer will remote view the event known as the \"Tunguska Event\" that occurred on the morning of 30 June 1908. This event involved a large explosion over Eastern Siberian Taiga, near the Stony Tunguska River, in Yeniseysk Governorate (now Krasnoyarsk Krai). This event resulted in the flattening of forest over more than 2,000 sq. km, or 800 sq. miles. The viewer will perceive the explosion itself, as well and the cause of the explosion. The viewer will also perceive other elements that attract the attention of the remote viewer that directly relate to the explosion and its cause.\n\nNote: The above target description was given to the remote viewers only AFTER the remote viewers had completed and delivered all remote viewing (paper sessions and video) for this project.\n\n\nMy paper remote viewing sessions for this target can be found here: https://www.remoteviewed.com/remote-viewing-the-1908-tunguska-explosion/\n\n\nThis project was originally done for The Farsight Institute - http://ww.farsight.org\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links:\n===========================================\nDaz Website: https://www.remoteviewed.com/\n\nEight Martinis - FREE Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nWhatsapp group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVVpWa8JfBUHikCxKJvjGw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nTelegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Nvl6G1Q04YueN3q6i_t7Lg\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1w2lrs1pDo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1w2lrs1pDo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1w2lrs1pDo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1w2lrs1pDo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g1w2lrs1pDo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":80,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"g1w2lrs1pDo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"45yhNqwxKKxonLFsnJ1KxOdPf7I","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLngtWTBiQWNuR3hN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-03-20T13:38:01Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing discussion - Signal and Noise, 19 march 2021","description":"Friday Night Remote Viewing discussions.

One can only speculate. Nonetheless, the session is fascinating, and Farsight is offering it now to the public simply because the session is interesting. All remote-viewing sessions done in all projects at The Farsight Institute are conducted under blind conditions.\n\n*This video was re-posted with Kind permission from Courtney Brown and Farsight: http://farsight.org*\n\n==========================================\n*Daz recommended Remote Viewing links:*\n===========================================\nDaz Website: www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - FREE Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nWhatsapp group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVVpWa8JfBUHikCxKJvjGw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nTelegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Nvl6G1Q04YueN3q6i_t7Lg\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/\nRussell Pickering's Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJY9HNjfRd8uvGtwuKd_cA","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6idtQW8rZlY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6idtQW8rZlY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6idtQW8rZlY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6idtQW8rZlY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6idtQW8rZlY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":85,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6idtQW8rZlY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yARaZ4R3Owchbl6j1yonXtn9YJ4","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLlIzMENRWUFPTnBR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-27T14:30:28Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing community chat with john Cook and Pam Coronado from IRVA, Feb 26, 2021","description":"A Zoom chat: FEB 26, 2021.Hosted by Daz Smith with GUESTs:  John Cook & Pam Coronado, The President & Vice President of IRVA\n(International Remote Viewing Association)\n\n\nIRVA:\nThe International Remote Viewing Association (IRVA) was organized March 18, 1999, by selected scientists and practitioners meeting in Alamogordo, New Mexico in conjunction with the first professional conference on Remote Viewing in Ruiduso, New Mexico.\nhttps://www.irva.org/\n\n\n\nJohn Cook - President | Director\n\nJohn Cook has been entangled with remote viewing since 1998.

Zoom Remote viewing community discussion with Guest Elly Flippen.\n\nElly is the Niece of Ingo Swann and one of the people in charge of his estate. We  discussed the latest manuscript release MASTER OF HARMLESSNESS and Ingo Swann's other published works, his art, his remote viewing, and Elly shared some amazing phonographs and memories of growing-up with Ingo.A fantastic community talk with lots of great questions and comments.\n\nThe Book - Master of Harmlessness on Amazon - https://amzn.com/B08RX9DFFH\nThe Ingo Swann website - https://ingoswann.com/\n\nAbout Ingo Swann:\nProminent American psychic research subject, parapsychologist, and author. Born September 14, 1933, at Telluride, Colorado, he studied at Westminster College, Salt Lake City, Utah, receiving a double bachelor’s degree in biology and art. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and served three years in Korea, after which he worked for twelve years at the United Nations Secretariat while pursuing an independent art career.\n\nSwann’s active participation in parapsychology research began in 1969 when he was 36 years old. During the next twenty years he worked only in controlled laboratory settings with scientific researchers. Although he lectured widely on the importance of psychic faculties and potentials, he has never publicly demonstrated his abilities. Because of his participation in hundreds of thousands of experimental trials, author Martin Ebon wrote of him as “parapsychology’s most tested guinea pig,” and Psychic News and other media often refer to him as “the scientific psychic.”\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links:\n===========================================\nDaz Website: www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - FREE Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nWhatsapp group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVVpWa8JfBUHikCxKJvjGw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nTelegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Nvl6G1Q04YueN3q6i_t7Lg\nReddit -  https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/\nRussell Pickering's Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJY9HNjfRd8uvGtwuKd_cA","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWcF4Ub0ocg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWcF4Ub0ocg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWcF4Ub0ocg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWcF4Ub0ocg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWcF4Ub0ocg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":87,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dWcF4Ub0ocg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Pw-3QS7d9axMxIc90Eb5k7EVysM","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLno4NkdlNEF4cnBr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-13T16:45:36Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Open Community Remote Viewing Discussion Hosted by Russell Pickering 12 Feb, 2021.","description":"The discussion consisted of a range of interesting topics including: general remote viewing questions, CRV, future predictions, Ingo Swann, Scientology and remote viewing, and way more...\n\nRussell Pickering's Youtube channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJY9HNjfRd8uvGtwuKd_cA\n\nDaz recommended Remote Viewing links:\nDaz Website: www.remoteviewed.com/\nEight Martinis - FREE Remote Viewing magazine - http://www.eightmartinis.com/\nWhatsapp group - https://chat.whatsapp.com/CVVpWa8JfBUHikCxKJvjGw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/remoteviewers\nTelegram - https://t.me/joinchat/Nvl6G1Q04YueN3q6i_t7Lg\nReddit Remote Viewing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z86Ge4Axrpk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z86Ge4Axrpk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z86Ge4Axrpk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z86Ge4Axrpk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z86Ge4Axrpk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":88,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"z86Ge4Axrpk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"TdGFpPgy1gFYTb164nVftmMkz-4","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLkZ2T3FMUnJqYWZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-06T22:04:12Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"Remote Viewing Discussion with Star Gate remote viewer Angela Ford","description":"This is a 2hour Zoom Chat with Guest Angela Ford, hosted by Daz Smith and with questions from the Remote Viewing community.

This was a BLIND remote viewing experiment as part of Farsight's ongoing Mysteries series. \n\nArea 51 is the common name of a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. Area 51 was first made famous by Bob Lazar and his video of the UFO test flights in the late 80's. The legends and rumours have continued to this day. \n\nThis amazing video is the raw video footage of Daz's final remote viewing session captured LIVE on camera.

The data was not what I was expecting.\n\nBackground:\nOct 2 1999 - Jaryd Atadero, 3, went on  a hike up the Big South Trail in Podure  Canyon, CO with a group of adults and  his 6 year old sister. His father, Allyn Atadero stayed at the lodge he owned  and operated.\n\nWhile on the trail, the adults were split between two groups, and the kids were running between the groups.  This was the last time he was spotted.\n\nA five day search for Jaryd was held by Larimer Co Sheriff's office, but was thwarted by a SAR helicopter crash on Oct 5th, and snow that rolled into the Rocky Mountains. \n\nHe was believed to be spotted by two fisherman on the trail, who he approached and asked them if there were bears nearby.\n\nThe case went cold for a number of years, until hikers found clothing consistent with a young boy on the trail 3.5 years later, on June 4, 2003. \n\nHairs were also found on the clothing, which were not consistent with Jaryd's dark hair. Allyn Atadero identified the clothing as Jaryd's. \n\nPartial remains were found on June 14th, 2003. The remains were parts of a skull cap and a tooth link Both  the remains and the clothing were found on a cliff above the trail, which was difficult to traverse. \n\nAllyn contests that his son's pants were inside out, as if they were pulled off of him when he received pictures to identify. \n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.canammissing.com/jaryd-atadero.html\nMissing 411 trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDy2srebK8\nThe Missing 411 full documentary available to purchase here: https://is.gd/JvZzhZ","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quihTPKJDXs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quihTPKJDXs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quihTPKJDXs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quihTPKJDXs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/quihTPKJDXs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"RemoteViewed","playlistId":"UUECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","position":112,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"quihTPKJDXs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"RemoteViewed","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"oM5-aXbav2dEQ68ocQpJBgipeLU","id":"VVVFQ2prRDhRMVZyajd4NmNULTVmeTJRLjZjNmdVY0JGekZB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-11-23T14:24:50Z","channelId":"UCECjkD8Q1Vrj7x6cT-5fy2Q","title":"remarkable review","description":"My name is Daz smith and this is my two month plus review of using the Remarkable Tablet device for the sole use of Remote Viewing.\n\n//reMarkable - the only digital device that feels like paper.
