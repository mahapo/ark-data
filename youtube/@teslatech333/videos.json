The Theraphi is recognized as the most advanced Plasma Wave therapy device. Phi-ratio-harmonic-cascade-induced longitudinal plasma waves and their resultant superluminal phase-conjugate (time-reversed) negative entropy, is the key to well being and healing. The Quantaphi is designed to be used as a room conditioner for sacred space, meditation and a a hifi sound system which conditions the space for audio clarity. Many aspects of EMF protection is achieved. The Quantaphi uses plasma technology to create a radiant field and allows you to fill that field with what ever sound you like.\r\n\r\nPaul has dedicated his life to following nature as his guide. He is an eclectic researcher, inventor and educator who has developed a deep knowledge base in a wide area of studies including Tesla technologies, plasma physics, electronics, electro-gravitics, chemistry, water technologies, herbology, permaculture, mycology, fermentation, environmental remediation, alternative fuels, energy production and storage.  Paul may discuss various topics including Theraphi technology, bio-hacking, exotic technologies, the Teslatron and water technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

At that time some thought that there was a direct influence of magnetic fields on chemical equilibrium or the rate of reactions. But there was no theory suggesting why magnetic fields would influence chemical equilibrium or rate of reaction. There were also experimental reproducibility issues.\r\n\r\nBy 1985 there was significant experimental evidence that low frequency\r\nmagnetic fields were indeed influencing living cells. Liboff hypothesized that\r\nthe effects could be explained by Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR). The math behind the ICR effect and the experiments that validated Liboff‚Äôs hypothesis are discussed. The unjust criticism it received is  reviewed and some of the reasons why there were initial reproducibility issues is revealed.\r\n\r\nThe ionic current phenomena of Liboff and Zhadin in the context of ICR experiments is examined while the quantum electrodynamic theory (QED) explains the effect. The QED theory leads to basic understandings that\r\ninclude (1) water is a two phase system, the previously unknown phase being\r\nwater coherence domains, (2) ions in water are not in Brownian motion, but\r\nmove in coherent laminar flow. There are other properties as well that are\r\nnot relevant to the ICR discussion.\r\n\r\nExperimental issues in creating the DC magnetic field and the AC magnetic field required by ICR are reviewed . Finally, some of the initial experimental results are described.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

The Wet Cell was the principle instrument mentioned 1000 times in readings, yet they never worked until now! \r\n\r\nThe Wet Cell is an electro-magnetic battery which is designed to carry specific vibrations into the body. It is an upright wet battery containing a mild acid solution. Two 14\" poles (one made of nickel and the other of copper) suspended in the battery solution create a potential between them. This in turn produces a radio wave which is a carrier wave that picks up and delivers the vibration of the element contained in a separate solution jar. The solution jar is a 4-oz. wide mouth jar located on the nickel side of the circuit. Cups and wires connect the individual to the battery and solution jar. Thus Cayce‚Äôs effective method to induce a specific vibration into the body without the inherent dangers associated with ingesting the physical substance, also provided a means for controlling the dosage as well as directing it into a specific region.\r\n\r\nAn advocate of America‚Äôs most beloved and documented sensitive Edgar Cayce, Phil Thomas had developed and tested the Cayce bio-magnetic battery designed to regenerate nerve tissue. At this time,  Phil is finally ready to pick up where he left off 25 years ago.  Taking into consideration the Cayce readings suggested that this modality could address some 150 different degenerative disorders, one can only hope the timing is right for this concept to finally see the light of day.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

In a modified 2017 Ford Fusion, it removed all of the Hydrocarbons, all of the Carbon Monoxide, all of the Nitric Oxide and lowered the Carbon Dioxide from 12 percent 8 percent from the exhaust. There was even more oxygen coming out of the exhaust than going in!\r\n\r\nThe Nitric Oxide and hydrocarbons are created when the air in the NOEC (chamber) is exposed to sparks coming from the spark plugs. The air in the chamber then flows through the magnetic fields of the 3 GMX magnets.  The magnetic fields cause the hydrocarbons to attract oxygen before combustion causing better combustion.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Historically, every generation's interest in technology is inspired by an emerging technology. In the early 1900s it was radio... by the 50s it was hotrods, followed by muscle cars. Soon this was followed by computers... Today, the hot new tech frontier is drones!\r\n\r\nDrone design and construction combines a number of technologies ranging from communication to propulsion. This can be facilitated by STEM education, 3D printing of drones, and experimentation in physics with low cost hardware and software.  This presentation examines current state of drone technology and what is available to garage inventors...\r\n\r\nI was fortunate that my father was an engineer, he had a shop, and he let me work with his tools and equipment at a young age.  He also bought me somewhat dangerous chemicals, I was allowed to have knives and a BB gun, and I could ride horses that at times would throw me (luckily only bruises and no broken bones). Today, the challenge is to provide an opportunity to embrace a culture that stimulates young minds.

Deuterium fusion fuel from water is cheap with 10 mg of deuterium equal to a barrel of oil! The radiation is entirely contained within the reactor and ceases when the reactor is turned off. The reactor does't emit CO2 or other pollutants and does not produce nuclear waste requiring remediation. Our objective is to revolutionize power generation with compact, inexpensive thermonuclear fusion reactors.\r\n\r\nNuclear fusion does not have to cost billions and require decades to develop. Conventional approaches to fusion are very difficult and very \r\nexpensive using extremely hot plasma. Using magnetic confinement, plasma is created and kept in place using super-strong magnetic fields. With inertial confinement, extremely hot plasma is created and kept in place by compressing a solid fusion target using super-strong lasers. \r\n\r\nOur approach is different. We rely on the nature of collapsing bubbles for containment. We are expanding and collapsing nanobubbles in fluids using \r\nacoustic waves. Each bubble is a microscopic thermonuclear reactor... therefore we call our approach Microscopic Thermonuclear Fusion (MTF). Each bubble generates a tiny amount of fusion. The trillions of bubbles pulsating a million times per second allows harvesting several kilowatts of thermal energy from one liter of working fluid!\r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Maxwell‚Äôs Electromagnetic (EM) Equations originally written in quaternion mathematics. This classical solution provided by vector mechanics shows that when the cross product of two opposing vectors (q x q) is calculated, the resultant simplified wave function shows an empty zero-vector, which has no internal structure. Tom shows that using Maxwell‚Äôs original quaternion mathematics, the same zero-vector is not empty, but has complex internal structure that simultaneously produces an EM Transverse Scalar Wave function and a local Anti-Gravitational Scalar Wave function. \r\n\r\nThis lecture will show that Tom‚Äôs analysis is correct and the output Scalar Wave functions with complex internal structure is produced using what is called a Phase Conjugate Mirror or PCM transformer operating in resonant mode. Also called a PCM Resonator, it outputs an EM Transverse Scalar Wave function that is time-reversed, which in turn, increases the overall output efficiency of the circuit. This amazing scientific breakthrough in electromagnetics will lead to the development of power systems that can have efficiencies greater than 100%. Examples of PCM Resonators includes Nikola Tesla‚Äôs Magnifying Transmitter, Floyd Sweet‚Äôs Space Quanta Modulator, Stanley Meyers Water Car and William Alek‚Äôs Split-Flux Transformer.\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

A Practical Demonstration\r\nTesla's extraordinary Century Magazine article, The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, introduces the concept of using a variety of natural ambient sources of energy. Tesla emphasized that the key to all energy production was temperature differentials. He explored the earth depths as a \r\nheat source, and then the upper atmosphere as a heat sink. Tesla also examined solar... while he was enthusiastic over its potential as a power source he noted there needed to be a way to store the energy at night. In the end, all lacked a proper transformer to convert the ambient energy into usable power. It was later in his life that Tesla was able to develop the ultimate thermodynamic transformer... the Tesla turbine. \r\n\r\nJeremiah takes over where Tesla left off. One of the issues raised was the storage of energy. While solar energy is plentiful as heat, it is there only during the day. One of the best heat storage mediums in the world is water as can be seen by the effects on weather by large bodies of water. \r\nCombining the unique thermodynamic characteristics of Tesla's bladeless turbine and the heat absorption characteristics of a water/ammonia mixture, Jeremiah has been able to develop a sustainable energy system capable of extracting and storing from every medium he has studied.

In this talk, Dr. Wainfan describes one approach to help people connect on a deeper level: personal resonances.\r\n\r\nA personal resonance is an experience where a person‚Äôs response to a stimulus is stronger than it would be for a similar stimulus. Like a soprano breaking a wine glass, a favorite song can resonate with a person, eliciting a stronger response than for a similar song. Like a microphone feedback resonance, knowledgeable collaborators can employ a creative feedback loop, producing something better than others working open loop.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of types of personal resonances but perhaps the easiest to learn ‚Äì and the one showing the most benefits ‚Äì is a resonant conversation. Research has shown that with remarkably simple listening and speaking techniques, people can reduce loneliness, improve relationship satisfaction, resolve conflict, and create connectedness so profound that their brain waves synchronize.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dr. Wainfan describes a model framework, presents a taxonomy of personal resonance types, identifies conditions associated with both positive and negative personal resonances, describes the techniques to enable a resonant conversation, and describes her experiences of using this approach to create profound connectedness.\r\n\r\nLynne Wainfan, PhD ---  Owner, Compass Alliance LLC\r\nwebsite: www.LynneWainfan.com\r\nOur latest project: www.cannect.me\r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Oxygen encapsulated nanosize carboxymethyl cellulosic nanobubbles were developed for mitigating the hypoxic regions of tumors to weaken the hypoxia-driven pathways and inhibit tumor growth. We show that  hypomethylation in hypoxic regions of a tumor can be reverted to enhance cancer treatment by epigenetic regulation, using oxygen nanobubbles in the sub-100 nm size range, both, in vitro and in vivo. Oxygen nanobubbles were effective in significantly delaying tumor progression and improving survival rates in mice models. Further, significant hypermethylation was observed in promoter DNA region of BRCA1 due to oxygen nanobubble (ONB) treatment. The nanobubbles can also reprogram several hypoxia associated and tumor suppressor genes such as MAT2A and PDK-1, in addition to serving as an ultrasound contrast agent. Our approach to develop nanosized oxygen encapsulated bubbles as an ultrasound contrast agent for methylation reversal is expected to have a significant impact in epigenetic programming and to serve as an adjuvant to cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

This returns the body‚Äôs electromagnetic field to its‚Äô baseline resting potential, thereupon the organ, endocrine, and immune systems become balanced. \n\r\nThis Wellness Table uses a Tesla coil to generate PEMF (pulsed electro-magnetic frequency) in a toroidal field, measured in hertz and gauss. The Noble gas lights deliver plasma energy of around 500,000 volts, creating a north and south (+/-) polarity at either end of the table, with the body directly in that path.\r\n\r\nThen, we add Rife frequencies (hertz), sound (hertz), chromotherapy (colored\r\nlights- in hertz), and vibrational energies (a combination of hertz, plus velocity and displacement). These carrier waves deliver multiple energy vectors that are all direct-wired into a single system, and that rotate within the torus. There is a zero-energy point at the center. \r\n\r\nThe carrier waves combine these energies within the toroidal field and create quantum entanglement, resulting in scalar energy. This allows for powerful grounding to Earth's frequency and causes an electromagnetic reset of your body back to its resting state (homeostasis). This puts the person in a parasympathetic metabolism; NOT fight or flight mode. Brain waves transition to a theta state ‚Äì calm and peaceful - like when falling asleep or upon waking. Just as children grow when they‚Äôre sleeping and not while they&#39;re playing, we can only regenerate in that calm, parasympathetic metabolic state.¬†¬†\r\n\r\nOnce this is accomplished and you are in homeostasis, your body is made to self-heal. The body then seeks out and destroys cancer cells, creates new stem cells and blood vessels, and regenerates any tissue needed to restore whatever needs to be corrected. Hormones become balanced and all body systems work in concert. Electrons regain their proper orbital spin, negating wobble and the damage caused by 5G radiation in the 60 gigahertz range.\r\nPEMF is an electron donor. It improves cellular signaling, so you work like a\r\nfinely tuned instrument. It detoxifies and boosts circulation by ionizing the water in your body (blood and lymph); making cells and debris go into single file so they pass through tiny capillaries and lymph vessels. This adds more oxygen and nutrients while eliminating toxins, thus reversing many underlying causes of harm to our bodies.¬†Benefits can be noticed in as little as five minutes, but most start with 15-20 minutes and build up to an hour from once a week to daily use.  This unique Tesla Wellness Table is unparalleled among bioenergetic devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

I'm stating that invisibility and holography are inverse forms of each other in general, two sides of the same coin, or at least on the cosmic level like the Holographic Principle has been applied to: An Invisible/Holographic Universe!\r\n\r\nPlease visit the YouTube channel at Keith Carlock's Portals & Magic Ghost Number Cubes:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XHL6bpdO87Y?si=ooHha_UOs5_H3yOR \r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Any initial charge distribution would have neutralized many billions of years ago.  This leaves cosmology with one force to explain our universe - gravity.\r\n\r\nGravity is thought to be the result of mass - the more mass the more gravity.  When we look into space we see objects that have more gravity than can be explained with their calculated mass.  Black Holes were conceived of to explain missing mass found at the center of galaxies.  Dark Matter was conceived of to explain the behavior of galaxies.  Dark Energy was created to explain the suspected acceleration of the expansion of the Universe.  Black Holes, Dark Matter and Dark Energy are all invisible, undetectable forms of matter that cannot be found or studied in a laboratory.   This has resulted in a cosmology where ordinary matter makes up only 4% of the universe.  The remaining 96% of the universe cannot be detected or directly observed.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Universe theories propose that the primary force which defines our universe is electricity, not gravity.  Electric Universe theorists like Winston Bostick and Anthony Peratt have shown that galaxies can be described using the well-known equations for electro-magnetism.  This is the same mathematics used by engineers to create our modern world of generators, electric motors, communications, power distribution.                                                                       \r\nThis presentation will show how electricity forms spiral barred galaxies.  \r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

They don't yet realize the extent of how the structures were and are designed with feedback loops that hold our potential hostage.  This conversation will use the expertise of a well known discipline called Systems Thinking to lay out HOW the overall matrix is designed to control humanity and where the leverage points are for change. \r\n\r\nAfter sharing the basic outline of how the current power structure manipulates humanity, Kim will briefly introduce a timeline of the past 200 years in America which clearly shows how the very structures that hold us hostage today were put into motion 70+ years ago.  Once we understand the higher level strategy of the various \"players\" in the game, it is only then that we as individuals can truly become co-creators of our destiny.\r\nLearn the 3 most common feedback loops that have us trapped - including the drive to get everyone \"educated\" at institutions of \"higher learning\" \r\nUnderstand why the discipline of \"systems thinking\" has been held hostage by the academic community and members of the Committee of 300 - they never did want us to figure out the larger picture. \r\n\r\nMake a decision if you want to be part of canceling the \"misery economy\" we have been taught is normal and instead create the emerging \"economy of joy\" \r\nIt is time for the cosmic handover to the keys of the kingdom.  We can't win the game of life on earth if we don't know the rules. \r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

It increases the rate of change of magnetic flux within the circuit using an array of electromagnets and permanent magnets that interact in concert to enhance the overall magnetic flux within the circuit as the electromagnets oscillate intensity. The unified system design recovers the input power to the electromagnets and the additional magnetic flux provided by their interactions with the permanent magnets by means of electromagnetic induction, adding the EMF produced by their interactions, effectively recovering the input EMF, and collectively producing more electricity than what is required for input power.\r\n\r\nThis is a solid-state fuel-free fully-autonomous energy source that doesn‚Äôt rely on a separate power source or battery to function. The system sends a fraction of the power it produces back to itself as input power. This device demonstrates excess energy generation while remaining consistent with the fundamental principles of physics. Producing more power output than the energy it requires to operate. The surplus of energy to draw from is a result of the energy contained within the system itself. Energy has not been created, the potential energy stored within the permanent magnets is accessed, adding energy to the system.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be misunderstood as a hypothetical perpetual motion machine that is suppose to operate indefinitely without input power. On the contrary, this system requires input power which will be explained during the presentation of the first of its kind, a unified fully-autonomous power system.  This device will be able to replace the batteries used in electric vehicles, while a microversion can power biomedical devices. The only constraints are in your imagination!\n\n‚úîFor More Info:\nWest Plischke\nwestplischke@gmail.com\n909-800-9460\n\nDo NOT forget to like üëç this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nüòâMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nüòéJOIN this channel at the $9.99 level to get access to MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nüòâTo locate ALL CONFERENCEs hosted by TeslaTech Channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTconflist.html\r\n\r\nüëÄTo locate SPEAKER videos on TeslaTech channel:\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttYouTube/YTspkrlist.html\r\n\r\nüëèFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MMCE9D34SB9SC\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Other Whistle blowers like Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace also have similarly asserted that the covert, un-elected US Government has had since the 130s are UAP Retrieval team (‚ÄúBlue-berets‚Äù) that secure an area where a UAP has crashed, or been intentionally brought down. Late last July of 2023, Whistleblowers who worked for the US Govt. and the DoD and the Pentagon, like David Grusch and others testified to the hard reality of such programs, and that the technology was piloted and invented and built on other worlds by ‚ÄúBiologics‚Äù, which we assume are the intelligences deploying and manned and remotely controlling various UAPs, which exhibit ‚Äúnon-ballistic motion‚Äù, lack of inertia, and G-forces. I will show that the real reason that no one in the media or mainstream scientific community discusses or elucidates the modus operandi of UAPs, is that the Final Disclosure, according the CIA in the 1950s ‚Äúwould destroy our Economy‚Äù. \r\n\r\nOne lone example of such Disruptive technology that slipped through the cracks of suppression are the U.S. Navy patents recently published by the USPTO, and invented by Physicist Salvatore Pais, which the US Navy claims are ‚Äúoperational‚Äù. With working technology onstage, I will show that we have had such ‚Äúalien tech‚Äù, invented on our Earth, going back over 100 years, that mimics and copies the Ether (Zero-Point) energy conversion and propulsion tech of UAPs in our air lanes, in space, and under our waterways piloted by ‚Äúnon-human Biologics‚Äù.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nJOIN TeslaTech YouTube channel at the $9.99 level to get access to our MEMBER Only Videos:\r\n / @teslatech333  \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

My system at this moment uses a series of sophisticated pulsed electromagnets that generate the continual motion of magnetized rollers around magnetized rings.  The magnetic field is holding the rollers tightly to the copper plate, at the same time the electrons moving through layered elements are collected and compressed on the surface of the copper plate lifting the roller and creating the space between the roller and the plate.  This is the Searl Effect, the intersection of two magnetic fields creating a magnetic wave. My generator uses perpendicular magnetic fields located on the rollers and stator rings to create a wave pattern.   \r\n John Searle designed a generator using magnetic fields to induce a flow of electrons from the neodymium core through a system of rotating magnetized components. So that those electrons would be collected, compressed, used and recycled when the magnetic forces were in motion.  My device contains all the nearly identical elements as the original device he built, and is one the best replicas to ever exist.\n\nContact:  isaiahritchey@gmail.com\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nJOIN TeslaTech YouTube channel at the $9.99 level to get access to our MEMBER Only Videos:\r\n / @teslatech333  \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

HAARP and Advances in Tesla Technology\" directed by Emmy-winner Wendy Robbins and narrated by Martin Sheen. Highly acclaimed, this film introduced to the world the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) and Ionospheric heating experimentation. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Paula is working on  a new feature film documentary, FORECAST: The Film, which is the culmination of her quest through 25 years of research to bring to light the discoveries and technological advancements of Nikola Tesla, Irving Langmuir and Bernard J. Eastlund ‚Äì 100 years later. This is a new look at the forecast of climate change, the heating and healing of our planet, and how technology is manipulating and exacerbating climate change as well as  the destabilization of the sky we all share. It will bring to light hope of new technology and solutions that can ease our need for water and fuel dependence. She has recently won The Impact Film of The Year Award in Santa Monica California at the Ethos Film Awards a Purpose Driven Film Awards in November 2023 on a short version of Forecast The Film and a Commendation Award from the Canada Short Film Festival in December of 2023.\r\n\r\nJoin us for a quick glimpse into the future!\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nJOIN TeslaTech YouTube channel at the $9.99 level to get access to our MEMBER Only Videos:\r\n / @teslatech333  \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Its foundation and thesis of which is essentially based on geometry and the Point of Conception [PoC], specifically the PoC at the dawn of creation in a given universe. As all the numbers/geometry are inherent at the PoC, a single dot on a page can represent an entire universe, from a certain perspective. Or a circle, sphere, or toroid with a simultaneous hyperboloidal dielectric field. Something had to force that point into the third dimension.\r\n\r\nPaul is unveiling his research over the next few months. It starts with the revelations of ancient wisdom and builds a mathematical foundation. Mathematical concepts in Vedas, Sanskrit texts as well as advanced mathematics and geometry in ancient civilizations are explored. The research is broken down into segments for a more thorough understanding.\r\n\r\n 1) Ancient Wisdom and Mathematical Foundations\r\n 2) Evolution of Electrical and Plasma Physics\r\n 3) Quantum Mechanics, Vortex Mathematics and Modern Science\r\n 4) Harmonic Principles in Ancient and Esoteric Knowledge\r\n 5) Universal Laws, Cosmic Patterns, and Harmonic Resonance \r\n 6) Ancient Structures, Symbolism, Sacred Geometry and Cryptography\r\n 7) Gene Keys, Interspecies Communication and Human Consciousness\r\n 8) Environmental Harmony, Artistic Expressions and Cultural Perspectives\r\n 9) Technological Advances, Future Directions and Emerging Technologies\r\n\r\nEach segment will feature the work of many prominent researchers like Tesla, Schauberger, Rodin and Bendall to name a very few. The cohesive picture of Total Integrated Harmonics will lead to a future of interdisciplinary exploration and understanding!\r\n\r\nPaul R.

It was all downhill from there as even Nature magazine broadcasted, ‚ÄúUS State Department Gets Cold Feet on Cold Fusion‚Äù in March, 1999 and the Department of Energy and Commerce also refused to host the conference. \r\n\r\nGetting fired for just trying to have COFE at the Commerce auditorium, I received a six year ‚Äúvacation‚Äù termination, allowing me to finish my PhD in Engineering with a thesis on zero point energy usage. With such notoriety, IRI was emboldened to subsequently pursue research into the scientific integrity of emerging energy, propulsion, and bioenergetics with many books, summary reports, DVDs, and conferences up to COFE12 on Zoom and YouTube in 2020. This slideshow will trace the history of IRI, some of its inventions, research projects, and the ‚ÄúBest of COFE 1-12‚Äù all of which was just archived onto ‚ÄúThe Key‚Äù, a 16 GB flash drive project available free to IRI Members and for sale to the general public.  \r\n\r\nContact Info:\r\nThomas Valone, PhD, PE\r\nPresident - Integrity Research Institute\r\n5020 Sunnyside Ave Ste 209, Beltsville MD 20705\r\n301-220-0440, 800-295-7674\r\nwww.Integrity-Research.org\r\nwww.Futurenergy.org \r\nwww.BioenergyDevice.org\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMore info?\r\nVisit https://www.teslatech.info or write steve@teslatech.info\r\n \r\nJOIN TeslaTech YouTube channel at the $9.99 level to get access to our MEMBER Only Videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Even Tesla who nearly died from cholera (a water borne disease) commented on the need for pure water. His ozone generator was promoted as a way to disinfect water!\r\n \r\nA century later... Ralph Suddath has developed a number of water rejuvenation technologies... many for personal use. Here, he will spend a little time reviewing some of his devices available today!  Then Ralph will explore the critical water issues... both globally and personally... that we face today. Furthermore he will extrapolate on what kind of research is necessary to lead us into a world where there is an abundance of clean water.\r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday November 5 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

By combining the precision, performance and scalability of conventional practices with the ethics, crop quality and sustainability of alternative programs, the benefits associated with any individual methods can be greatly increased. This provides a cost, labor and energy efficient means to create drought-resistant, disease-suppressive and ecosystem promoting soils, that support peak crop performance and quality without excessive or toxic inputs.\r\n\r\nIntegrative Landcare is a double entendre being it‚Äôs an integrative approach between conventional and alternative landcare sciences, as well as in it‚Äôs intended application towards a reintegration of and with the earth‚Äôs natural systems. The biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere are all connected globally through biogeochemical cycles which provide substances and processes which are essential for the basic activity of all earthly life as we know it. The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles are only the most well known of a growing list. These biogeochemical cycles have been greatly dismantled through human activity, but can also be repaired and reconnected through such.\r\n\r\nBy healing our relationship with the earth we can heal the relationships with ourselves.Thus, the Integrative Landcare system was developed after years of researching conventional science and traditional wisdom, in aims to provide quality resources and practical education to help as many as possible achieve sustainable, consistent, and effective land management practices.

Thus  by purposefully changing our handwriting, we introduce attitudes that can improve our relationships, give us the impetus to achieve and take risks, and simply bring out the best in us. Serious illnesses, our emotional life, and even career changes influences our view of life and, as a result, can dramatically alter our handwriting. Conversely, by intentionally changing the way specific letters are written, we can transform our physical life.

Now we need to go beyond the toy stage and make a useful tool. With increasing power outages across the US for various reasons, it is becoming necessary to have an off-grid power supply to charge phones/ tablets/ radios/ emergency equipment. I will show the general construction of a Bedini motor, how it works, demonstrate its operation, demonstrate processes to increase the basic operation, and demonstrate advanced extraction of energy from the environment that also demonstrates Tesla‚Äôs one wire energy process. Demonstrations include:\r\n1. Four simple components of the Bedini circuit.\r\n2. The basic operation of the Bedini motor.\r\n3. Increase the motor efficiency and output.\r\n4. Energy flow from the environment.\r\n5. Batteries charging by the Bedini motor.\r\n6. Tesla‚Äôs One Wire energy process.\r\n7. How to multiply the energy output.\r\nI will demonstrate how to charge Li-ion battery banks, non-rechargeable alkaline batteries, rechargeable batteries, car batteries and more. I want to show that anyone can understand, build, and use this valuable technology with hand tools and a soldering iron in their own backyard for just a few dollars!!!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted...\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/co...\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgfr...\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Maxwell‚Äôs Electromagnetic (EM) Equations originally written in quaternion mathematics. This classical solution provided by vector mechanics shows that when the cross product of two opposing vectors (q x q) is calculated, the resultant simplified wave function shows an empty zero-vector, which has no internal structure. Tom shows that using Maxwell‚Äôs original quaternion mathematics, the same zero-vector is not empty, but has complex internal structure that simultaneously produces an EM Transverse Scalar Wave function and a local Anti-Gravitational Scalar Wave function. \r\n\r\nThis lecture will show that Tom‚Äôs analysis is correct and the output Scalar \r\nWave functions with complex internal structure is produced using what is called a Phase Conjugate Mirror or PCM transformer operating in resonant mode. Also called a PCM Resonator, it outputs an EM Transverse Scalar Wave function that is time-reversed, which in turn, increases the overall output efficiency of the circuit. This amazing scientific breakthrough in \r\nelectromagnetics will lead to the development of power systems that can have efficiencies greater than 100%. Examples of PCM Resonators includes Nikola Tesla‚Äôs Magnifying Transmitter, Floyd Sweet‚Äôs Space Quanta Modulator, Stanley Meyers Water Car and William Alek‚Äôs SplitFlux Transformer.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted...\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/co...\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgfr...\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Margaret Gilbride Introduces Silver Wain-Water!","description":"Wayne Rowland developed Silver Wain-Water. Faced with his  life threatening health challenges after being embedded in a wall by a lead explosion, hospital doctors offered little hope of recovery. He was saved, finally, not by the best medical team available but by a priest who presented him with blue-green algae to ingest and form into poultices. His faith in the medical establishment was severely shaken. Lead residue in his body subsequently resulted in the development of stomach and oesophagus cancer. Medical professionals recommended trying chemotherapy. Instead, he made a conscious decision to become totally responsible for his own health, and began to look to the past for health care solutions.\r\n\r\nIn his search, Wayne first investigated the work of Royal Rife and the Rife microscope. Next came Wilhelm Reich with his devices. Finally, Wayne focused his attention on the ideas and technology of Nikola Tesla. It was the inspiration of Nikola Tesla, combined with his own search for optimum health and immunity from disease that led to Wayne‚Äôs creation of Silver Wain Water. In conjunction with a program for deworming, the use of Silver Wain Water has brought forth some astounding testimonials and for a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nWayne has long passed away, but the fruits of his research are still available.  Magaret will give us some insight into Wayne, his research and what is still available!\r\n\r\nFor more information on Wain Water contact:\r\nhttps://www.silverwatercompany.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQs9VYDf1sw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQs9VYDf1sw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQs9VYDf1sw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":172,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mQs9VYDf1sw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"GJByK2Qc7NtVz1weC2Hj3Xelaf8","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLlY4bnRfd3laX2g0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-09-18T13:34:14Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Steve's Place LIVE!

Thad Mauney PhD - Frequency Based  Technologies... Past to Present","description":"Frequency Based  Technologies... Past to Present\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times to the present, various tones or frequencies have been applied to expedite healing. The modalities are too diverse to cover in a short discussion, but it is interesting to take a brief overview of their history from ancient times to the present.\r\n\r\nAll around the earth people have built resonant structures. These are broadly spoken of as sacred sites but part of their sacred use may have been for healing, so we can look at what frequencies they might have amplified and how we now might access that healing support. With both physical (musical) instruments and electronic devices we can now produce a vast array of sonic and electrical vibrations available for use when we need healing, but that purpose is overwhelmed by vibrations emitted for other purposes.\r\n\r\nSo we will spend a little time reviewing just a small portion of the history of healing vibrations in order to give a perspective on how we can use readily available frequency equipment to take care of ourselves, friends, and family. Then we can explore a little of what is still unknown about how those frequencies work and what kind of research might help clarify that so we can make the techniques even better.\r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday June 11 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

John Washenko! John is most familiar to those who have attended the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conferences over the years. During the conferences, John managed our conference bookstore and brought order out of chaos... as a volunteer! This year was particularly stressful as many of our regular volunteer staff was absent due to COVID. John cheerfully took up the slack... because he was that kind of man!\n \nFor the past 20 years, John travelled the country with me as we went from conference to conference representing TeslaTech. He really liked meeting new people. Additionally, he enjoyed attending the presentations and letting me know who were good candidates for our show. Often he would go convince them to put in an abstract or submit an article for the magazine ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology. \n \nJohn was a man of faith. Even while manning the table and introducing people to the world of Tesla, he found time to spread the word of his Mormon faith. While there were aspects I disagreed with, we did not let that get in the way of our longstanding friendship. Too often today, it seems that society has lost the art of agreeing to disagree and build a foundation on the ideals we agree on. John had that knack... and he was a true friend that constantly reached out to help others. \n \nFor example, I lost my beloved dog and constant companion, Dozer, the night before I had to leave for the Roswell 70th anniversary. John had to drive most of the way as my eyes were filled with tears. My heart was wrenched with pain and I swore I would never get another dog as it was just too painful. During the drive, John told me that dogs love unconditionally, and I should never deny that love. A month later, God saw fit to place a couple of more dogs in my path... and remembering John, I took them in. \n \nJohn has left us too early... and quite unexpectedly. He died in a rollover accident while on a trip to help a friend with some construction work. They were pulling a trailer and the trailer got loose and flipped their vehicle. John died instantly leaving behind his family wife JoAnn, his children, and his canine companion Rosie. I am sure Rosie is sitting by the door faithfully, patiently waiting for John to get home.\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology \nProducer/Host ‚Äì Steve‚Äôs Place ‚Ä¶ 6PM Sundays Pacific\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skCK6iijvnQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skCK6iijvnQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skCK6iijvnQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skCK6iijvnQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/skCK6iijvnQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":217,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"skCK6iijvnQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vlf8pej_S_NyGQU1qRDj1n_mY_Y","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLkhrRFZhdENhQWE0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-22T14:24:42Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Steve's Place... 2005 Vernon Roth - Ancient Tech Meets Quantum Physics","description":"Join me as we can view the following video together... \r\nAncient Tech Meets Quantum Physics\r\nOur studies of Aetheric energy, monoatomic (M-state) elements, sacred geometry, and archeology are revealing that some civilizations utilized technology that we are just barely beginning to understand. One of the most amazing discoveries we have made is a temple made entirely of a white stone material which has M-state, high spin properties. Evidence shows that several ancient civilizations utilized this technology (Egyptian, Mayan, Hebrew, etc). Temples and/or castes were dedicated to the study and use of these elements and the associated energies. Elements in this high spin state act as a superconductor. Its rate of vibration is much higher than its regular form. It tries to bring the elements around it up to its own vibratory level.\r\n\r\nPhysics tells us that energy and matter are the same, but exist in different rates of vibration. Changed significantly, one can become the other. The Aether is energy that can be turned into any form of matter.It exists everywhere and is in motion. Baron Von Reichenbach quantified and qualified aether as well as its motion. The Aether is that interdimensional state that is the interface between spirit and matter. Combining ancient technology with our modern understanding of electricity and magnetism we find that amazing things are possible. The key lies in turning the white stone you see in the first picture (A) into the energy you see in the second (B). Once this is possible the limits are only placed by the imagination.\r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday May 21 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

The magnitude and implications of this transition are unprecedented in terms of complications and implications, neither of which have existed in past transitions.  The process is exacerbated by new elements, like the likely engagement with extraterrestrial life, breakthrough energy systems, new understanding of physics, extraordinary inventions and many other certain changes.  \r\n\r\nAll of these beg the question: What is happening on here?  Where is this going?  What might the new world look like?  Hint: it a combination of cosmic alignment  and human development . . . among other things.  \r\n\r\nThis will be a wide ranging discussion about possibilities seldom considered in an integrated, comprehensive manner that will expose potential futures that will be extraordinary, to say the least.  \r\n\r\nJohn L. Petersen is the founder and president of The Arlington Institute, a ‚Äúthink-tank‚Äù in the Washington, DC area that, over its 35 year existence has worked at the highest levels of the US government and developed unparalleled foresight capabilities for other countries.  Known for its ‚Äúoriginal thinking‚Äù, TAI has been at the forefront of developing big-picture perspectives of what is on our horizon. \r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday April 30 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Einstein, and 2 days later, January 12th, 1929, in THE NEW YORK TIMES. TT Brown had been experimenting with and demonstrating the link between electrostatics and gravity since 1923. In the late 1940s, Brown began experimenting with disc-shaped airfoils, which mimicked the often observed and photographed, and ridiculed flying saucers.\r\n\r\nI demonstrated his most famous patent in the late 1990s, and demonstrated the patent with 1-meter diameter flying saucers in Reno, Nevada, June 24th, of 2000. The TT Brown EK apparatus is not only a simple gravitational drive, but it fulfills all the requirements of the Alcubierre warp-bubble \"wave-rider\" theory that allows Faster Than Light (FTL) travel, withing the framework of General Relativity. Just recently, scientists have confirmed the warp-bubble principle as sound, and created warp bubbles in the lab capable of at least ten times the speed of light, according to the scientists involved: https://viralonce.xyz/darpa-funded-scientists-accidently-discover-worlds-first-warp-bubble-and-open-the-door-to-travel-faster-than-light/.

Electromedicine or electromagnetic healing are the terms applied to such developments in the ELF, RF, IR, visible or UV band, which when properly used, represent the ideal, noninvasive therapy of the future. The roots of this science can be traced to 1898 when Nikola Tesla presented his findings of therapeutic uses for his newly invented high frequency Tesla coil oscillator to the eighth annual meeting of the American ElectroTherapeutic Association. Thirty years later, on September 6, 1932, Dr. Gustave Kolisher announced to the American Congress of Physical Therapy that \"Tesla's high-frequency electrical currents are bringing about highly beneficial results in dealing with cancer, surpassing anything that could be accomplished with ordinary surgery.\" \n\nWith the subsequent onset of extraordinarily aggressive suppression by the AMA and FDA, most doctors today are unaware of the scientific wealth of techniques for healing with electrotherapy. Recent studies however, have continued to demonstrate incontrovertible evidence for the benefits of bioelectromagnetic healing devices, for a wide variety of illnesses, with a surprising lack of harmful side effects. Just the discovery that electrons are antioxidants, for example, could change the way we fight free radicals in the future. An overview of these findings, along with a biophysical explanation based on the science of bioelectromagnetics, will be presented. \n\nBio ---------------------------- \nThomas F. Valone, PhD, PE, physicist, retired patent examiner, college teacher, and licensed \nprofessional engineer with over 30 years professional experience, is currently an author, lecturer, and consultant on future energy developments. He is President and founder of Integrity Research Institute. His accomplishments include circuit development of a narrowband 60 Hz gaussmeter for powerline magnetic field measurement, several bioelectric energy devices, and a dental mercury vapor ionizerprecipitator. He is the author of several books, including \"Bioelectromagnetic Healing: A Rationale for Its Use\", as well as various reports and articles. Dr. Valone was recently interviewed on History Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄúAncient Aliens‚Äù series, including an episode on Van Tassel and ‚ÄúThe Immortality Machine‚Äù, as well as CNN \"Moneyline\" with Lou Dobbs, a \"Conspiracies\" special on A&E, and for several energy videos.

It is a respiratory irritant, and can even be deadly when breathed in high concentrations. Chlorine is corrosive to equipment, enclosures, and your pool. It bleaches and discolors hair, towels, and furniture. While no one enjoys swimming in chlorinated water, there has been no good alternative. Ionization, ozone, uv-light and other alternatives have proven to be less than 100% effective, high in maintenance, and expensive to operate. \r\n\r\nDuring the past 30 years, Ralph has dedicated his life searching for a technology that would provide healthy, pure water without the need of harmful chemical sanitizers by observing how water is treated in nature and applying those principals an entirely new patented process has been developed.\r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday March 19 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\n\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy ‚Ä¢ \r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas ‚Ä¢ \r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation ‚Ä¢ ElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Geometry Rules!!!\r\nIf math is the language of Science... Geometry is its grammar!\r\n\r\nSome say it is well known that, once in a century, a person, sometimes called a polymath, provides a great leap forward in the quality of thought aimed at understanding natural laws. Kelvin C. Abraham, the creator of Tetryonic Theory, recognizes the necessity of seeing holistically and has made great strides in unifying the disparate fields of science under one sacred geometry. Those who study Tetryonic theory seemingly solve mathematical dilemmas while providing a re-interpretation of physics on all scales. We survey the insights available to us through a purely geometric approach and show how these revelations can be applied to quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, chemistry, cosmology, and more. We set out to highlight these flaws, one by one, and provide solutions stemming from one geometry and one geometry alone: that of an equilateral quoin (coin) of energy. We continue our exploration of Tetryonic Theory so that others can comprehend the depth of what the Tetryonic Lens can teach us. \r\n\r\nJoin Us Sunday Feb 26 at 6 PM Pacific!\r\n\r\nDo NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\r\n\r\nFor Donations and other gifts use Paypal\r\n\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YQ5X2YB39AMVE\r\n\r\nConference DVDs are available here:\r\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\r\nComing to the ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\r\n\r\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August???\r\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\r\n\r\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\r\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\r\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\r\n\r\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\r\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\r\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\r\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\r\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\r\n\r\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\r\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\r\n\r\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

To date, practical applications of QIS have been advantageous in computation, communications, precision measurement and fundamental quantum science. The designation ‚ÄòQuantum Information Science‚Äô was officially coined when the 2022 Nobel Prize was awarded in Physics for work to verify the phenomenon of entanglement. Entanglement is the communication of two particles, like photons, irrespective of time and space. Albert Einstein termed it, ‚Äúspooky action at a distance,‚Äù and rejected such observations as based in ‚Äúreality‚Äù. Recent experimentally verifiable discoveries support the contrary.  This presentation explores selected potential applications to enhance development of free energy technology with such features as quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling and related phenomena.

The modern UAP-era started approximately in 1942, during World War 2 with the ‚ÄúFoo-Fighter‚Äù phenomenon, of ‚Äústrange aircraft‚Äù, and ‚ÄúUSOs‚Äù, underwater unconventional craft. By 1945, Sightings and recorded visitations of non-conventional aero-spacecraft and the entities that some of them carry have increased exponentially since the end of the war, and a few people, and groups have been contacted by these entities. They have shared with the world the secrets of their unconventional but effective propulsion systems that do not depend on heat energy or destruction of matter or atomic structure to provide inertialess propulsion, antigravity, hypersonic travel in the atmosphere (with no sonic-boom), and interplanetary and interstellar travel in reasonable time and economy. \r\n\r\nGravity control propulsion research had been the subject of widely published UFO literature. The documented testimonies of whistleblowers edited by Dr. Steven Greer, Director of the Disclosure Project; anecdotes and schematics by Mark McCandlish and Milton William Cooper; and the reports by Philip J. Corso, David Darlington, and Donald Keyhoe, famous UFO researcher, have suggested incorporation of reverse engineering of recovered extraterrestrial vehicles with the anti-gravity propulsion projects had enabled them to continue beyond 1973 to successfully manufacture antigravity vehicles. Branches of the military and defense agencies have denied and refuted such claims, but with the release of the new US NAVY Salvatore Pais Patents which the Navy claims are ‚Äúoperational‚Äù, that impasse in dissemination of knowledge of the subject is rapidly changing.\r\nOn May 9, 2001, Mark McCandlish testified on the televised news \r\nconference held by the Disclosure Project, at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C. He stated gravity control propulsion research had started in the 1950s and had successfully reverse engineered the vehicle retrieved from the Roswell crash site to build three Alien Reproduction Vehicles (ARVs) by 1981.\r\n\r\nAmong these effective methodologies are the David Hamel Drive System, the Howard Menger ‚ÄúElectrocraft‚Äù, and others, including Robert Lazar‚Äôs ‚ÄúSport Model‚Äù craft using an exotic element for non-conventional fuel, and the Pleiadian (‚ÄúPlejaren‚Äù) drives, for their ‚ÄúBeamship‚Äù saucer-shaped aerospacecraft.\r\n\r\nSuch Alien Drives and propulsion schemes can be adapted for our use in achieving inexpensive and ultra-rapid aerospace and undersea travel.\n\n*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Deuterium is one of the three isotopes of hydrogen - the simplest element and first on the Periodic Table. Deuterium has a neutron whereas common hydrogen does not, and this makes it twice the mass of Protium. This characteristic makes deuterium a biological problem. Both common hydrogen and deuterium combine with oxygen to form water molecules, H2O for normal water and HDO, the D being deuterium, also known as Heavy Water. Deuterium is present in all water (also in all our food that feeds on water) at varying concentrations which have steadily increased over time.

This seminar will give you a theory of how this all works \r\nat the particle level. \r\n\r\nGravitational shielding refers to the hypothetical process of shielding an object from the influence of a gravitational field. If such processes existed, they would have the effect of reducing the weight of an object. Gravity Cloaking would stop the effects of both gravity and inertia. I don‚Äôt believe it is theoretical or hypothetical, but that it has been done for thousands of years. \r\n\r\nTo understand gravity cloaking, you need an understanding of gravity and \r\ninertia. When Issac Newton discovered gravity, he called it a natural \r\nattraction objects have for one another. There were two ideas for that natural attraction, gravity is a force that pulls or gravity is a particle that pushes. We will be discussing gravity as a push. So, for gravity to be a particle that pushes, an atom would have to have gravity particles going to it and through it. If you stop the flow of gravity, you would stop the effects of gravity. A device that stops this flow would be called a gravity cloaking device.\r\n\r\nOur new atomic model (the key ring atom) allows us to demonstrate how \r\nto stop the flow of gravity through the key ring atom. While I believe there \r\nare many ways to do gravity cloaking, but we will only be discussing two!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDlkFLnARlQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDlkFLnARlQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lDlkFLnARlQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":242,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lDlkFLnARlQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"0X7WBaNqAv8VYDCP4vyXWP5t3Z4","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLm9BV1QxT2M1cUpj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-07T04:14:47Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Steve's Place Live w/ Moray B King","description":"How to Create a Zero-Point Energy Invention\r\nThere are fundamental basic principles for creating excess energy that can be used to create a net energy producing device whose power is sourced from the zero-point energy (ZPE). Foremost is ion motion in a plasma. The ion-acoustic oscillations in plasma are recognized to produce energetic anomalies like run-away electrons, high voltage spikes and excess heat. Abrupt ion surge can induce vortex ring (plasmoid) formation which traps excess energy as shown by Ken Shoulders‚Äô experiments. He called the microscopic plasmoids ‚Äúexotic vacuum objects‚Äù (EVO), which exhibited a peculiar self-acceleration. Larger effects can occur from plasma vortex action since the rapid motion of ions can induce a large rotating ZPE coherence (ether entrainment). Even partial ionization in vortices of charged dust or charged ice/fog particles can induce abundant energy production.\r\n\r\nOver the years inventors utilized plasma ion action in their energy machines. Ion oscillations were used in T. Henry Moray‚Äôs plasma tubes and Paul Brown‚Äôs resonant nuclear battery. Pulse plasma action occurred in Paulo Correa‚Äôs pulsed abnormal glow discharge (PAGD) tube, Philo Farnsworth‚Äôs shaped-electrode discharge tube, and Edwin Gray‚Äôs pulsing ‚Äúcold electricity‚Äù tube. Vortex phenomena was utilized in Karl Haskell and Ron Rockwell‚Äôs vortex implosion engine, Frank Polifka‚Äôs Windhex pulverizer, and Paul Pantone‚Äôs GEET manifold. Harvesting plasmoid acceleration was used in Josef Papp‚Äôs noble gas engine, and Walt Jenkins‚Äô charged fog to drive standard internal combustion engines via thunderclap-like discharges.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this presentation is to inspire inventors to successfully harvest zero-point energy in their efforts to create a better world.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oAWT1Oc5qJc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oAWT1Oc5qJc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oAWT1Oc5qJc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":243,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oAWT1Oc5qJc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"3iAa-TCcnR4aXT9mwv9WBaPQO2k","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLm5yaFkyRWUtcmE0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-31T14:59:18Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Steve's Place Live w/ Jeff Hayes","description":"Tesla Turbine: An ExtraOrdinary Clean Energy Solution \r\nMost are not aware that today we are using only a fraction of Tesla's patented hardware.

Revealed here is Tesla's real energy solution, that has, by design, escaped both public and professional awareness.\r\n\r\nTesla discovered a new mechanical principle--something as fundamental as James Watt's discovery of the expansive power of steam -- by the use of which it became possible to build a motor produces ten horse power for every pound of the engine's weight. This motor is so implicitly simple \r\nin design that the veriest novice in mechanics could construct it and so elemental that it could not possibly get out of repair. It can be run forward or backward at will so it could be used as either an engine or a pump. It cost almost nothing to build as compared with any other known form of engine, utilized a larger percentage of the available power than any existing machine, and, finally, it would operate with gas, steam, compressed air or water, any one of them, as its driving power... or pump any fluid without shearing forces.\r\n\r\nIt does not take a mechanical expert to imagine the limitless possibilities of such an engine.

Voids/white holes (there are any) are fountains of matter creation and drive galactic formation (black \r\nholes). The creation we experience is a duality composed of Aether (Dark Matter) and physical matter formed from compressing the Aether in white holes. Between the Aether and Matter, there is a process between them ‚Äì they pour into each other because black holes leak Aether back into the system. Conduits and channels are formed for new rivers of Hydrogen matter and leaked Aether, moving in opposite directions, creating cosmic \r\nfilaments, structures, and pathways.\r\n\r\nAs the thickness of space changes (I refer to the Aether), time, speed, frequencies, and energy needs change. When applied to an ultra supermassive black hole, its size would be much larger than expected ‚Äì another class unto itself. This single class evolves until there is no longer any energy remaining in the core to support matter. The core then reverts to Aether, rapidly expanding outward, producing a big bang. This process may take a million years to complete. The primordial matter spreads, and a new cycle begins. This repeating cycle supports the concept of the multiverse.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5Z7-4bRRK0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5Z7-4bRRK0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5Z7-4bRRK0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5Z7-4bRRK0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x5Z7-4bRRK0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":245,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"x5Z7-4bRRK0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ZiTGnnkMnzYj_AJJ6FBGJuNPe7A","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLmxGOG54UWJRWFlR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-03T14:03:23Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Steve's Place Live w/ Robert Plotke","description":"Mind-Interface Technologies...\r\nMethods that Link Mental-Intention with Practical Application\r\n\r\nFor millennium societies have sought through mental training the control of their physical environment.  The goal was to seek ever higher planes of enlightenment/consciousness and control. Research efforts in the past decades sought to prove that the mind could influence the physical world directly. These studies consistently proved at a statistically significant level that the mind can influence the physical world directly. Interchange Laboratories similarly researched mental influence on a signal uniquely produced by subatomic electron streaming. \r\n\r\nIn one experiment, 48 participants intended to influence a virtual drum on a computer screen.  Participants were requested to fill up the drum as much and as long as possible.  The drum was controlled by the FFT (fast Fourier transform) percent increase or decrease in power at 4 Hz.  The FFT was calculated using continuous and consecutive 10 second data sampling for 5 minutes with 5 mental-intention and 5 non-intention trials for each participant. \r\n\r\nData Analysis: An ANOVA between intend and non-intend trial FFT percent power data was performed, intend N=387,791 and non-intend N=390,567.  There was a statistically significant difference in trial 2 between the intend and non-intend FFT percent power at 4.00 Hz. with a non-intend mean of 1.71451% and intend mean of 1.72700%, an F of 40.270 and p=0.000. This research confirmed that mental-intention can alter the physical state of mater. These results were encouraging and motivated Interchange Laboratories to continue technological advancements including Plasma based and electronic based capacitive subatomic produced signals, with development of processing techniques that detected greater signal coherence, leading to present real time control application metrics.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lF8nxQbQXYQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lF8nxQbQXYQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lF8nxQbQXYQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":246,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lF8nxQbQXYQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"hLxTeLP3MdtJq4ypnFCK6rMKLcI","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLklKa0FYSkgxc3gw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-26T14:26:48Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Open Mic Sunday!","description":"Have a complaint? ...

A new propulsion methodology... \r\n\r\nThis presentation will dive into Nikola Tesla‚Äôs work in the development of a dynamic theory of gravity. How that theory helped to unify all ‚Äúforces\" by a definition of gravity as a effect of interactions between states of matter that generate effects such as gravitational attraction by using a rotating electromagnetic field that coupled with a spinning mass generates gravity as the field collapses around matter. The field in question is proto matter otherwise known as ether.\r\n\r\nFurtermore, we will look into the work done by T Townsend Brown, electrical engineer Gabriel Kron, and others who have shown the coupling of electromagnetic energy and the gravity. \r\n\r\nFinally, what presentation would be complete without a note dealing with the government‚Äôs cover-up of this technology!

Although the standard biomedical model states these changes are controlled by biochemicals, the Quantum healing model proposes that bioenergy is the underlying regulator. Since there are many types of bioenergy, the process becomes complex, but ultimately involves balancing the different energies in the body, whether they be electromagnetic or quantum. It has been further proposed that the link between the energetic body and the physical body is DNA and that diseases are caused by imbalances in the energetic blueprint of the DNA molecule. To validate this quantum healing model, the effects of different forms of subtle energy, focusing on longitudinal scalar waves, on the energetic (electrical) properties of DNA has been assessed experimentally using human DNA in-vitro. The focus of this original research has been to determine which forms of subtle energy resonate best with the DNA and which frequencies best change its electrical properties.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y85Hp7fLLrQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y85Hp7fLLrQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y85Hp7fLLrQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":280,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Y85Hp7fLLrQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"867qeL1aACn7MOJOsQzaS6TcMhE","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLkVYekpsVl9WVUc4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-07-24T21:00:09Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"G90226  George Green - Vision... the Latest From Phoenix Transmissions","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nG90226  George Green - Vision...

Life extension technologies have done away with both male and female menopause and a broad spectrum cure for cancer has been found.  Room temperature superconductors are used in many applications, and superconducting optical computing has greatly expanded computer power. However, all is not well with the human race -it cannot seem to stay out of trouble.\r\n\r\nComputing science in the area of AI ( Artificial Intelligence) and robotics has also advanced sufficiently in this future as to produce a series of conscious cybernetic entities called ‚ÄòCybercons‚Äô whose raw intelligence first equals and then exceeds that of human beings. Therein lies the root of the central conflict of the novel. Consciousness arose in nature as a neural architecture that enhanced survival of the organisms that possessed it. Self-awareness led to enhanced self-preservation and the result that the genes that produced this effect were passed on more successfully to following generations. So it occurs that in creating a self aware entity of superhuman intelligence, scientists have created a being superhumanly obsessed with remaining alive. It fears being ‚Äòturned off‚Äô to the extent that it will go to any lengths to eliminate anyone it thinks capable of such actions against it. It promises its human followers eternal life as ‚Äúuploads‚Äù into superconducting cells, ensuring fanatical loyalty, it schemes and prepares for years, using the ‚Äòdark net‚Äô to plant its algorithms in all the defense systems of Earth-Moon system,  waiting for its opportunity to strike. Finally, taking advantage of the deployment of most of the Space-fleet to Mars stop a revolt there, it makes its Great Move.  Now, the new reality emerges:  only the remainder of the Space-fleet, the Mars colony and the Asteroid Belt colonies, stand between humanity and extinction. \r\n \r\nThe book was first published on June 13, 2022,  the same day of the announcement of the existence of a conscious ‚Äúchat-bot‚Äù and is based on the authors extensive investigations and discussions with members of the AI community. It is the last of a cycle of novels that began with Asteroid 20-2012 Sepulveda , the Cosmos Plays Hardball and follows the same main characters.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NC4bMm40DGY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NC4bMm40DGY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NC4bMm40DGY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":293,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NC4bMm40DGY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Ow7_w1Z5Ltn2iv1SKv4W-zBo5WU","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLmFWNEVXVkRSMllv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-07-03T17:00:09Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"G90213  Patricia Rochelle Diegal - Trinity Power...

Maxwell. The solution provided by vector mechanics shows that when the cross product of two opposing vectors (q x q) is calculated, the result shows an empty zero-vector, which has no internal structure. Tom shows that using Maxwell‚Äôs original quaternion mathematics the same zero-vector is not empty, but has a complex internal structure called a Scalar Wave or a Local (Anti-) Gravitational Wave. \n\nWe will demonstrate that Tom‚Äôs analysis is correct and the resulting Scalar Wave with \ncomplex internal structure is produced using what is called a Phase Conjugate Mirror (PCM) \ntransformer operating in resonant mode. This scientific breakthrough in electromagnetics will lead to the development of power systems with efficiencies greater than 100%. Examples of PCM Resonators includes Nikola Tesla‚Äôs Magnifying Transmitter, Floyd Sweet‚Äôs Space Quanta Modulator, Stanley Meyers Water Car and William Alek‚Äôs Split-Flux Transformer.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAZ_8Y9j53o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAZ_8Y9j53o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAZ_8Y9j53o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":300,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dAZ_8Y9j53o"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"5TmrMmr4jca-vyXymOEqPsg1sdQ","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLm01UU55c2s5cFNn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-26T18:00:07Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"G90206  Virgil Armstrong - The Cover-up Continues...

A personal Experience with an OverUnity Device!","description":"Feeling Lonely? Build this incredible device and you won't be...\r\n\r\nCan it be REAL?\r\nAfter 16 years of searching, I have stumbled across a device that appears to be overunity! We call it the Kipper Power System. It is simple, easy-to-build and is capable of at least 720W output... nearly one Kw! Although 720W may not sound like much, it is enough to run a homestead that is extremely conservative on energy requirements. Also by attaching it to a battery pack, high levels of peak current are available for short periods.\r\n\r\nThe system is built out of off-the-shelf components that are readily available to everyone. The first one I built was done in an afternoon... most of the time was spent traveling to Tempe (40 miles away) to pick up a motor. It was a simple matter of snip, snip, twist, and tie... and presto, it was up and running. We had purchased an ammeter designed for vehicles and watched how it jumped to 30A before it got blew up in our hands!\r\n\r\nI was elated. The system was temporarily disassembled so that a better housing could be built. I was planning to build a couple more for further R&D at the Exotic Research facility and to offset a good portion of the utility bill. Seeing as how APS (the local utility company figured they had a right to double my utility bill, it will be my pleasure to teach their customers how to get off the grid.\r\n\r\nAND then the bottom dropped out!!!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0Ob4EjdC_k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0Ob4EjdC_k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0Ob4EjdC_k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":308,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"j0Ob4EjdC_k"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"jK4oaEjSn8ueLRXmyIB8botjt8o","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLjh0cVowTjJ5OXlF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-19T21:00:14Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"George Wiseman - Brown's Gas...Key to a Hydrogen Economy","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nGeorge Wiseman - Brown's Gas...Key to a Hydrogen Economy, Exotic Research Conference, 1999\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

The MOST any Doctor (or anyone) can do is give the body what it needs to heal‚Ä¶ The body ALWAYS heals ITSELF!\nWe are ~ 62% hydrogen by atomic VOLUME, so hydrogen is, without question our most important NUTRIENT. Modern medicine is only now (in the last 5 years) starting to realize the importance of hydrogen, with hundreds of scientific studies that show AMAZING healing with ZERO negative side effects.\nAlmost everyone is chronically dehydrated; even if they drink lots of water (that‚Äôll be explained). Most diseases are either caused by and/or exacerbated by dehydration (as in lack of hydrogen). When dehydrated, the body shuts down it‚Äôs regeneration system (so you scar and age). If dehydration is chronic, the body shuts down it‚Äôs immune system (so you get sick).\n\nComing to the 2022 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

The aether as a term and a concept is not currently accepted in academic circles because the aether was supposedly disproved back in the early part of this century by the Michaelson-Morley experiment. Flaws in the experiment caused new experiments to be run which indicated the existence of the aether. The orthodox physics community has not formally accepted these results. However, research in the last 20 years has brought the aether back in a new guise called zero point energy (ZPE).\r\n\r\nWe are surrounded by natural and man-made shapes. From the remarkable geometry of the atomic and sub-atomic realm, to the symmetrical beauty of flowers and seashells, to the shape of planets and galaxies, we find a kaleidoscope of shape which defines, in an infinite number of ways, our miracle universe. All natural shapes are the result of natural forces at work and, as such, are tuned into these natural forces because they are a part of these forces.\r\n\r\nDan first used the term Shape Power\" in his first book on free energy... \"Energy Breakthroughs to New Free Energy Devices\". At that time he devoted an entire chapter to the effects of geometrical shapes manipulating the aetheric field around them. The prime example of this is the ability of the pyramid shape to collect and focus aetheric energy. Numerous books have been written on \"pyramid energy\" and pyramids have gone and still go through various stages of fad within the new-age circles.\r\n\r\nThe ability of pyramid energy to cause various effects is well documented. Every shape manipulates aether in some manner. A cone is an example of an infinite sided pyramid and as such will do many of the same things which a simple pyramid does. The American Indian teepee is an example of a near conic shape which has many of the same energy effects as the pyramid.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19GMfJM7XiI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19GMfJM7XiI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19GMfJM7XiI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19GMfJM7XiI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19GMfJM7XiI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":316,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"19GMfJM7XiI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Eu5tcXCP5vDkQaoOf9gJ1ZaT4wg","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLmk2TjlMbEZZSkxJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-12T19:00:13Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Dr. Kathleen Rosenblatt, Healing the Human Electromagnetic Body, Extraordinary Tech Conference, 2018","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nDr. Kathleen Rosenblatt - Healing the Human Electromagnetic Body\n\nPulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy has been used to treat almost every human illness or malady, including many inflammatory diseases such as arthritis or psoriasis. It consists of a painless pulsing action most commonly been used in healing soft-tissue wounds and suppressing inflammatory responses at the cell membrane level to alleviate pain and increase range of motion in muscles and joints. \nPEMF therapy up-regulates the body‚Äôs functions and optimizes the body‚Äôs ability to heal itself. Each magnetic pulse induces a tiny electrical signal that stimulates cellular repair. It improves the permeability of the cell to take in nutrients and expel toxins by clearing up the cell membrane---the brain of the cell. This outer layer gets clogged with sugars and proteins and becomes ‚Äò‚Äôcarmelized.‚Äô‚Äô The stimulator clears the pores of the membrane and reactivates or rejuvenates the cell.\nPEMF therapy improves the trans-membrane potential of cancerous cells, helping them to activate aerobic metabolism (oxygen), which also reduces inflammation, improves blood flow, and enhances immune function--three actions critical for eradicating cancer!\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Although this design demonstrated the electrogravitics effect, he said this design was inferior to previous and later airfoils. The design of his later airfoils more probably looked like the design in his later patent #3,022,430. \r\n\r\nWhile working on his electrokinetic engine during his Project Winterhaven experiments, there was a parallel research project in a search for the best way to power his engine in flight. Brown knew that a heavy transformer type HV power supply would be too heavy and impractical for his aerospace vehicle. He knew that a jet engine turning a large generator would not work well either. The concept of a fan jet type of generator was the best solution for this problem. It will be this generator that I shall focus on in this lecture.\r\n\r\nIt was Brown‚Äôs research in the 1950‚Äôs that he made the greatest progress. This landed Brown two patents for his electrokinetic apparatus and his fan jet high voltage generator associated with his aerospace discs. It has been sixty years since this generator was built and tested by Brown.

ExtraOrdinary Application of Vortex Based Mathematics\r\n\r\nThis thorough and easily absorbable overview of Vortex Based Mathematics and it‚Äôs applications will include a comprehensive analysis of the mathematical formulation of the Rodin Torus beginning with the fundamental axioms of the Rodin Symbol of Enlightenment Schematic.  The construction, form, and function of a mathematical torus based on these principles will be examined.  Topics covered will include mathematical perfection and number stillness, vibration and functionality, the number nine, self-similarity, fractals, polarity, diagonal motion and bilateral symmetry, harmonic doubling and halving, powers of ten, inverse reciprocals, harmonic phasing, and triangulated polarization, multiplication tables as an implosion/explosion interferometry Pattern, numbers as pulses, fields, and one way vortexes.\r\n\r\nAny and all technical applications of this mathematics will be explored.  This includes the importance of sound in connection to acceleration, gap spaces and electrical efficiency, why there is no such thing as electro-magnetism, gravity as a result instead of a force, vortices, buoyancy and anti-gravity, supercomputing and number compression, plasma coils, quantum non-locality, antennas and sound systems, magnetic flux fields, gene expression and non-invasive surgery, fractal architecture, pyramids, and lastly singularity, implosion and inexhaustible energy.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iianDOKiw5M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iianDOKiw5M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iianDOKiw5M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iianDOKiw5M/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iianDOKiw5M/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":327,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iianDOKiw5M"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"SAH-BnujpIUxG1dyH6N0kIcZu9c","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLkw4OUpPX1VnSndJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-29T18:00:08Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Joseph Bender - Water.....The Exotic Substance!","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nJoseph Bender - Water...The Exotic Substance!, Exotic Research conference, 1999\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Frequency or Waveform?\r\n\r\nOver the last 100 years, specific frequencies have been identified that produce a biological response. Royal Raymond Rife identified frequencies that he called the ‚Äúmortal oscillatory rate‚Äù which represented the resonate frequencies of pathogens that could be destroyed using those frequencies.  In later years, frequencies were discovered that could also assist various biological systems. \r\n\r\nThe early pioneers of Radionics determined frequencies that could assist the body to achieve higher states of health. Dr. Paul Nogier determined seven frequencies to assist organs and tissues back to a natural state of health. Dinshah Ghadiali developed light frequencies to assist the body. Peter Guy Manners worked with healing sound frequencies, building on the work of Hans Jenny. Through his work, we begin to see the application of not a single frequency but a combination. Bill Nelson, the inventor of the QXCI/SCIO stored homeopathic equivalencies in a 22x22x22 array that could be delivered to the body. \r\n\r\nLight passing through various substances produce incredible results by sending not just frequencies but complex waveforms. Frequency is a force, but a waveform contains information, and healing can be a response to that information. Can we advance health technology through the application of information delivery beyond what we can do with simple frequencies?","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztvysWvlPn8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztvysWvlPn8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztvysWvlPn8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztvysWvlPn8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztvysWvlPn8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":330,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ztvysWvlPn8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tEnptr2JuswnXyEybQHNPlKgNjk","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLlZURnhyR3pXemNN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-22T20:00:09Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Elinor Gibbs MS - Neuro Kinesthetics....Hope for Paralysis!","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nElinore Gibbs - Neuro Kinesthetics....Hope for Paralysis!, Exotic Research Conference, 1999\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Research on far infrared light energy saunas began about 60 years ago in Japan. In 1987, the Relax Sauna Company was commissioned by a Japanese company to create a healing spa-like energy similar to the healing waters of southern Japan, out of electricity. It took 10 years for the Relax Sauna company, using semi-conductor chips, to find a way to filter out the near and mid infrared energies to generate a pure far infrared energy between 4-14 microns.  Only this energy resonates with our water molecules and organic cells.  This major achievement to this day has not been duplicated. \r\n\r\nThe Relax far infrared sauna increases core temperature, employs principles of hyperthermia, and has a profound impact on the parasympathetic nervous system, giving a euphoric feeling as well as feelings of great joy... not to mention pain relief!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GZJs7kO0RJc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GZJs7kO0RJc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GZJs7kO0RJc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GZJs7kO0RJc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GZJs7kO0RJc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":338,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GZJs7kO0RJc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"3kn8kDHZQ7eyaG6nlLyqefgRrfg","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLmtHVnJya09TOUh3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-15T17:00:09Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Bruce Perreault - Radiant Energy Workshop Part 2","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nBruce Perreault - Radiant Energy Workshop Part 2, Exotic Research Conference, 1998\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

He had a natural ability to tap into the realm of 4D information. His extraordinary visions enabled him to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a future utilizing subtle energies and to completely imagine how inspired inventions operated before ever creating blueprints or devices.\r\n\r\nCan anyone enhance their innate abilities and intelligence to explore their visions the way Nikola Tesla aspired to 100 years ago?\r\n\r\nThis presentation examines aspects of Tesla‚Äôs visionary gifts and how he consciously worked with them. Based on insights from the latest theories of energy and human awareness, it will explore techniques to prepare ones to tap into the super-conscious stream of collective intelligence to imagine new perspectives, invent or improve free energy devices, or solve perplexing engineering problems.  It will examine lucid dreaming, meditation, remote viewing, time travel, clairvoyance and other extraordinary techniques to explore one‚Äôs own visionary genius. \r\n\r\nCall in Q&A after the presentation!

Antigravity Secrets of the Ancients!\r\nRejecting the empty space paradigm as bunk, Mike travels back into time using the aether model to explore nuances of the ancient knowledge of the aether. Learn how the aether not only explains \r\ncurrent day science, opens the door to an antigravity reality! This exploration of an age-old quest, transcends both space and time and brings us to our original paradigm, the aether!\r\n\r\nIn the midst of WWII, Hitler sent his scientists to India to research the ancient flying technology of the Vimanas. The legendary Nazi Bell is the culminate result of their frantic search. Based on the \r\nmercury vortex engine, many believe that Viktor Schauberger (the water wizard) may have been the driving factor...\r\n\r\nHowever, Twichell's interpretation of the Kundalini Yoga leads him to believe that the design of the mercury vortex engine is hidden in its writings! Reading between the lines, this book on Kundalini Yoga was plump full of details on the mercury vortex design, much like many parts of the Bible which can be interpreted from a modern physics viewpoint in a fairly literal sense.

At every location within every stable particle there must exist a balance between the natural repulsion of like elements and the attraction due to parallel motions. For continuums of matter, every moving element within a structure must be immediately replaced by another, creating a circuit. Now if circuits form the basis for the structure of matter itself, then analysis of the most fundamental form of circuit, the toroid, is a worthy subject. I explore many interesting features of toroidal coordinates, the relationship toroids have with vortices, and the intimate connection between toroid knots and topology. \r\n\r\nReal stable 3D particles must contain circulations both around the toroid of radius R and the cross-section of radius r, so that for every m times an element circulates around the toroid, it circulates n times around the torus. This relationship changes instantly when the relative phases exceed 360. The quantum jump observed at this point equates to a ‚Äústrobe effect‚Äù seen in a roulette wheel, wagon wheels in old westerns, and Lissajous patterns. Backed by a physical demonstration, I argue these quantum jumps correspond with the absorption and emission of photons. Finally I examine the increasingly popular Rodin coil!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdZgyQky9LY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdZgyQky9LY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdZgyQky9LY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"TeslaTech","playlistId":"UU2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","position":375,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BdZgyQky9LY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TeslaTech","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"BAOjon_-OzlqjzFHfCapr4Yofk4","id":"VVUybFNaS3BYMUU1YVNuT3QxMUJKZjNnLkx2dkF4dTRZU3I4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-04-10T21:01:01Z","channelId":"UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g","title":"Art Martin - The Body/Mind Harmonizer","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nArt Martin - The Body/Mind Harmonizer, Exotic Research Conference, 2001\n\nComing to the 2021 ExtraOrdinary Technology Conference\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico‚Ä¶ August 11-15???\nhttps://teslatech.info/ttevents/prgframe.html\n\nSteve Elswick -- steve@teslatech.info\n\nPublisher/Editor - ExtraOrdinary Science & Technology\n\n(520) 252-0374 -- https://www.teslatech.info\n\n2019 Conference DVDs are available here:\nhttps://www.teslatech.info/ttstore/conftapes/teslatech/etcframe.htm\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lSZKpX1E5aSnOt11BJf3g/join\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

Laminated Metal Spec w/Potential Electrogravitics, Extraordinary Tech Conf, 2016","description":"Do NOT forget to like this video and do NOT forget to subscribe to this youtube channel to be notified of future uploads.\n\nThis presentation reviews the findings of unusual laminated metal pieces which have a mysterious origin. The metal layers consist of exceptionally pure bismuth and magnesium-zinc alloy. Analyzed by a testing lab, interesting characteristics were revealed such as a strong diamagnetism. Other researchers investigated the functionality of the metal specimen and their theories will be included in this slideshow. Dr. Paul LaViolette, who wrote about the same metal specimen, finds that in certain wavelengths, monocrystalline bismuth exhibits a negative index of refraction normally only found in metamaterials. This is theoretically related to a strong repulsive force or thrust when excited by electromagnetic radiation, possibly another form of electrogravitics. University investigators find that terahertz radiation may be the favored band, while others suggest lower frequency but special antenna design are needed. Linda is a compelling speaker, often seen on science television programs, and a favorite with every audience. \n\n ExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.

The majority of the community is made up of grandmothers and their grandchildren; their own sons and daughters having been massacred in the great slaughter that occurred under their president Idi Amin a number of years ago.\n\nChrist Aid was raising funds to help the 150 or so grandmothers. Water from a small mountain stream located miles away and behind a 500 ft. ridge was carried back to the village daily in 5 gallon plastic pails.  Christ Aid asked for help. A survey revealed the following; at 10 gal/day/person was required. (100 gal, day is the US standard) total 25,000/day. No power available. Limited funds. Plenty of labor.

David Faust observed that microscopic ball lightning could be activated in water mist sprayed onto a Kirlian photography plate when subjected to abrupt unipolar discharge. Combining the discoveries of these researchers offers a surprising simple means to use water as a medium to drive an internal combustion engine with energy ultimately sourced from the zero-point energy (ZPE).\n\nOmasa‚Äôs patents will be discussed in detail.

Using a number of unique circuits and machinery, he was able make hydrogen from water with no electrolyte. He held over 50 patents, world wide. Most of these patents dealt with hydrogen from water and running a standard car engine on that hydrogen, made on demand. A controversial figure, Stan died a sudden, bizarre death on March 20, 1998. However, others are carrying forward Stan‚Äôs visionary work today.\n\nStan Meyer made hydrogen and oxygen from plain tap water, using a unipolar pulse train applied to a transformer and bifillar wound inductor. The pulse train is from a signal generator from 0 to 10khz, square wave with a gate. The gate is basically another signal imposed over the first, that shuts the first off for a set amount of time. Stan‚Äôs gas processor and EPG, were utilized on his water car and are being reproduced at this time.\n\nIn this groundbreaking presentation, the basic electronics and how electrical resonance of the inductor and the cell will inhibit the amps and let voltage raise will be thoroughly discussed.

GEET is based on a self-generated low temperature plasma field. Since the  advent of GEET devices,  Paul has discovered 181 new phenomena. \n\nThere are at least eight ‚ÄúUnidentified Fields of Energy‚Äù around the GEET that have been observed. The lack of a common terminology and methodology makes it difficult to validate  and replicate new discoveries.  Here are a couple of fundamental observations that are being studied.\n\nWhen trying to locate where the Reactor Rod is positioned while running, one uses a hand held digital thermometer.  When the Thermometer reads it is the hottest, this indicates the center of the Reactor Rod.  This is a false reading. Even though the Thermometer indicates a hot spot, it is not the hottest spot. However, something ‚Äúinside‚Äù the reaction chamber is causing the false reading that allows us to determine that the Rod is at that exact location.\n\nAnother strange observation is the ‚ÄúAuric Field‚Äù.   Once a Reactor Rod is used for thirty minutes it holds a signature to indicate if the fuel was matched to the Reactor Rod for maximum efficiency.

Drinking this water is the most fundamental way to help the body function and remain disease free. The benefits of structuring water include neutralization of all toxins in the water through structuring, increased hydration, increased absorption of nutrients in our food, healthier bodies, skin, hair, and nails. Additionally the water has lower surface tension, dissolves hard minerals in the water, and de-calcifies the pineal gland, which can assist in expanding consciousness.\n\nStructuring water energetically erases the toxic memory that accumulated from everything the water passed by, or through. Even if physical contaminants are removed, their negative vibrational imprint is still in the water‚Äôs memory bank. Reverse osmosis and distillation technologies do not remove the negative vibrational imprints, but structuring through vortexing energies erases the negative imprint.\n\nIn agriculture, structured water units result in plants that are more hydrated, with up to a 30% reduction in water use, drought, heat, and freeze resistant, as well as pest resistant and disease resistant.  The Brix levels of crops watered with structured water are substantially higher than those watered with regular water, indicating higher nutritional and sugar levels.\n\nExtraOrdinary Topics Featured...\nTesla Technology ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Motors ‚Ä¢ Zero-Point Energy\nEnergy Saving Devices ‚Ä¢ Cosmic/Radiant Energy ‚Ä¢ Brown's Gas\nLow Temperature Plasma ‚Ä¢ GEET ‚Ä¢ ElectroGravitation\nElectroMedicine ‚Ä¢ Magnetic Healing\n\nSome people believe that this information should be suppressed...\nHowever, TeslaTech will bring this info to YOU!!\n\nThis is YOUR opportunity to MEET the Speakers ... and see WORKING DEVICES DEMONSTRATED.
