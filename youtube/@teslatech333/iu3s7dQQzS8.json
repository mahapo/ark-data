it a okay for him"},{"startMs":354400,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"to u to talk about test again but before"},{"startMs":358000,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you get started I just want to remind"},{"startMs":359520,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"everyone to below the screen there um"},{"startMs":362240,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"there should be a th to give us a thumbs"},{"startMs":365160,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"up you know so that the uh sensors will"},{"startMs":369440,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"see that were good and help us promote"},{"startMs":371560,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"the test of stuff and that I'm just G to"},{"startMs":374240,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"turn it over to you Bill okay okay Steve"},{"startMs":379360,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"um let me see if we got"},{"startMs":382000,"durationMs":8840,"subtitle":"uh anything working here okay are you"},{"startMs":387520,"durationMs":7239,"subtitle":"controlling it from your end or"},{"startMs":390840,"durationMs":6759,"subtitle":"maybe not you're on control oh I

speaking"},{"startMs":406280,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"today about replicating Tom Bearden"},{"startMs":408520,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"scaler wave"},{"startMs":410560,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"technology and if any of you ever met"},{"startMs":413280,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"Tom beard he's quite a character and uh"},{"startMs":417400,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"when when he speaks you know at a at a"},{"startMs":420520,"durationMs":7959,"subtitle":"conference years"},{"startMs":421919,"durationMs":10761,"subtitle":"ago um it's it's just quite fascinating"},{"startMs":428479,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"okay so uh let's let's get into this"},{"startMs":432680,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"here okay my"},{"startMs":434879,"durationMs":7201,"subtitle":"timeline okay back in"},{"startMs":438160,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"1977 um while attending IIT Chicago"},{"startMs":442080,"durationMs":5559,"subtitle":"engineering school I was given a vision"},{"startMs":445360,"durationMs":6519,"subtitle":"and and to me it was the most"},{"startMs":447639,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"outstanding incredible thing I ever saw"},{"startMs":451879,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"and I was constructing an anti-gravity"},{"startMs":456199,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"disc and at the time I had no clue on"},{"startMs":459879,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"how any of this operated and it wasn't"},{"startMs":462919,"durationMs":6361,"subtitle":"until many years later here you know"},{"startMs":465720,"durationMs":7759,"subtitle":"things started to fall into place so in"},{"startMs":469280,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"1979 I graduated with a bswe degree and"},{"startMs":473479,"durationMs":4521,"subtitle":"began my professional career you I was a"},{"startMs":476280,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"hardware software"},{"startMs":478000,"durationMs":10199,"subtitle":"engineer and I worked at many many um"},{"startMs":483960,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"corporations okay and then in"},{"startMs":488199,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"1997 uh I found out about Tom Bearden"},{"startMs":491840,"durationMs":5359,"subtitle":"through uh this researcher by the name"},{"startMs":494479,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"of uh Richard Hogan spoke about Tom"},{"startMs":497199,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"Bearden and Richard put together this"},{"startMs":499639,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"conference in"},{"startMs":501159,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"Seattle and I said well okay I'm going"},{"startMs":503479,"durationMs":6361,"subtitle":"to go to this and it's it was uh Tom be"},{"startMs":507759,"durationMs":3081,"subtitle":"given a lecture on free energy"},{"startMs":509840,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":510840,"durationMs":6199,"subtitle":"anti-gravity I says oh okay things are"},{"startMs":514080,"durationMs":6079,"subtitle":"starting to fall into place"},{"startMs":517039,"durationMs":6401,"subtitle":"here and so I attended the lecture and"},{"startMs":520159,"durationMs":5961,"subtitle":"was just blown away by it and you know"},{"startMs":523440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"after listening to Tom Bearden speak you"},{"startMs":526120,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"think uh within a week or two you can"},{"startMs":528080,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"build one of these"},{"startMs":529600,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"devices um it it took me 20 years to put"},{"startMs":533920,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"all the pieces together here so in 2022"},{"startMs":538240,"durationMs":5719,"subtitle":"is when I began lecturing about Tom"},{"startMs":540160,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"bearden's technology what exactly he was"},{"startMs":543959,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"doing with this scaler wave you know"},{"startMs":547560,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"because he spoke that there were even"},{"startMs":549600,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"different types of scaler waves as well"},{"startMs":552519,"durationMs":6241,"subtitle":"and I'll get into this in the"},{"startMs":555360,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"lecture okay so the next"},{"startMs":558760,"durationMs":7319,"subtitle":"slide Tom Bearden quotes Okay now if you"},{"startMs":562720,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"ever heard Tom Bearden speak and at the"},{"startMs":566079,"durationMs":6281,"subtitle":"end of this video I give a lot of links"},{"startMs":568880,"durationMs":5399,"subtitle":"uh Tom bearden's videos here and one of"},{"startMs":572360,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"the things he mentioned is that all"},{"startMs":574279,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"matter is made of Trapped electrom"},{"startMs":577880,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"magnetic"},{"startMs":579279,"durationMs":6761,"subtitle":"energy and I'll get into that later on"},{"startMs":582399,"durationMs":6641,"subtitle":"what Tom meant by that okay because that"},{"startMs":586040,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"was actually in some of the um uh"},{"startMs":589040,"durationMs":5479,"subtitle":"physics videos YouTube videos that are"},{"startMs":592160,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"out there and you can watch these videos"},{"startMs":594519,"durationMs":6921,"subtitle":"because I include the links to them so"},{"startMs":597920,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"all matters made of tra electromagnetic"},{"startMs":601440,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"energy"},{"startMs":603040,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"okay and then the second thing that Tom"},{"startMs":605560,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"mentioned is that we cannot see the"},{"startMs":607760,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"dimension of time why because we"},{"startMs":610800,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"consider time to be in the fourth"},{"startMs":613880,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"dimension okay but we know time exists"},{"startMs":618160,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"because a lot of physicists out there"},{"startMs":619680,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"want to say well time doesn't exist at"},{"startMs":621800,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"all and blah blah this and that well"},{"startMs":624800,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"that's not true okay because we know"},{"startMs":627399,"durationMs":6281,"subtitle":"time exists because of space IAL"},{"startMs":630720,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"displacement so Tom always spoke about"},{"startMs":633680,"durationMs":9080,"subtitle":"that as well okay so the next"},{"startMs":638040,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"slide I did some analysis here and I"},{"startMs":642760,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"looked at the electric force versus the"},{"startMs":645000,"durationMs":7639,"subtitle":"gravitational force okay and you'll"},{"startMs":649040,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"notice that you know the electric force"},{"startMs":652639,"durationMs":6121,"subtitle":"and the Magnetic forces they're they're"},{"startMs":655680,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"considered to be vectors directional"},{"startMs":658760,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"vector vectors okay but the"},{"startMs":661320,"durationMs":5959,"subtitle":"gravitational force is a bit of an"},{"startMs":663240,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"oddball because it's"},{"startMs":667279,"durationMs":6761,"subtitle":"spatial okay it's it's everywhere and"},{"startMs":671040,"durationMs":6479,"subtitle":"it's considered to be a scaler okay it's"},{"startMs":674040,"durationMs":9479,"subtitle":"like time I I often say that gravity is"},{"startMs":677519,"durationMs":9320,"subtitle":"time time is gravity okay and so when"},{"startMs":683519,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"you do the analysis here you find out"},{"startMs":686839,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"that the difference between the electric"},{"startMs":688639,"durationMs":7961,"subtitle":"and the gravitational force is"},{"startMs":692360,"durationMs":7599,"subtitle":"enormous okay absolutely"},{"startMs":696600,"durationMs":7919,"subtitle":"enormous and so uh when you crunch out"},{"startMs":699959,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"these numbers you know it's 10^ the 42nd"},{"startMs":704519,"durationMs":8921,"subtitle":"power times you know the gravitational"},{"startMs":707639,"durationMs":8440,"subtitle":"force is the electric force 10^ the 402"},{"startMs":713440,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"power but what's very important about"},{"startMs":716079,"durationMs":5081,"subtitle":"this is that it's not zero"},{"startMs":719480,"durationMs":6359,"subtitle":"okay and that's what caught a lot of"},{"startMs":721160,"durationMs":8840,"subtitle":"physicists you know maybe 100 150 years"},{"startMs":725839,"durationMs":6201,"subtitle":"ago and I'll get into that here okay the"},{"startMs":730000,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"gravitational force is not well we know"},{"startMs":732040,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"it's not zero"},{"startMs":737000,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"okay so is there a link between"},{"startMs":740360,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"electromagnetism and gravity and"},{"startMs":744040,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"anti-gravity"},{"startMs":745639,"durationMs":6601,"subtitle":"okay and personally I would say"},{"startMs":749040,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"absolutely yes and so we see that the"},{"startMs":752240,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"electric and magnetic fields are"},{"startMs":755120,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"transverse Fields they're considered to"},{"startMs":757720,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"be"},{"startMs":758839,"durationMs":6281,"subtitle":"transverse um fields in this case so we"},{"startMs":762279,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"see the electron influenced by an"},{"startMs":765120,"durationMs":7159,"subtitle":"electric field moves in a straight line"},{"startMs":768199,"durationMs":6361,"subtitle":"okay the magnetic field moves the"},{"startMs":772279,"durationMs":4761,"subtitle":"electron in a circular"},{"startMs":774560,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"fashion and both are considered uh"},{"startMs":777040,"durationMs":7640,"subtitle":"transverse wave functions"},{"startMs":780040,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"okay but now we see that uh the"},{"startMs":784680,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"electron is when it's under Gravity a"},{"startMs":788560,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"gravitational influence here Gravity is"},{"startMs":791720,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"considered to be"},{"startMs":793440,"durationMs":6079,"subtitle":"longitudinal okay which is that

of"},{"startMs":1951720,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"your output and that efficiency can"},{"startMs":1953880,"durationMs":9200,"subtitle":"become quite"},{"startMs":1955559,"durationMs":9240,"subtitle":"large okay um I would say uh that uh"},{"startMs":1963080,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"Floyd sweet

output"},{"startMs":2008159,"durationMs":6441,"subtitle":"okay so it's a scaler wave generator is"},{"startMs":2011960,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"what he's doing here so he's me and he"},{"startMs":2014600,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"called it a magnifying generator which"},{"startMs":2017440,"durationMs":6199,"subtitle":"is what we're seeing here it

the"},{"startMs":2023639,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"output"},{"startMs":2024760,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"power okay so he calls it his

the"},{"startMs":2122079,"durationMs":9520,"subtitle":"opposing coil configuration here okay"},{"startMs":2126079,"durationMs":8361,"subtitle":"which is labeled hold 71 and 61 the"},{"startMs":2131599,"durationMs":5921,"subtitle":"output and we'll get to that in a minute"},{"startMs":2134440,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"uh on some of the details here but the"},{"startMs":2137520,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"objective for Stanley Meyers and his"},{"startMs":2140280,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"water car is to burn water not

wouldn't"},{"startMs":2148079,"durationMs":8760,"subtitle":"it burning water instead of gasoline no"},{"startMs":2152560,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"hydrocarbons just water okay and

more"},{"startMs":2159240,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"details"},{"startMs":2160599,"durationMs":5961,"subtitle":"here so next"},{"startMs":2163800,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"slide okay this is what Stanley Meers"},{"startMs":2166560,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"was doing with this"},{"startMs":2168160,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"Transformer very important here because"},{"startMs":2171040,"durationMs":5559,"subtitle":"he's setting up his opposing Magneto"},{"startMs":2173800,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"motive forces on

dialectric"},{"startMs":2195160,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"material okay and so what he's doing is"},{"startMs":2198960,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"creating what's called Brown's"},{"startMs":2202440,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"gas and I want to emphasize that Brown's"},{"startMs":2205440,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"gas because you'll find that with u"},{"startMs":2208920,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"Brown and he's credited with naming"},{"startMs":2212200,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"Brown's gas and and what we're doing"},{"startMs":2215200,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"here we're not separating"},{"startMs":2217319,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"hydrogen from oxygen we're not doing"},{"startMs":2219960,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"that here okay because you put that in"},{"startMs":2222520,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"separate tanks and then you burn that as"},{"startMs":2225640,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"fuel as Rocket Fuel okay we're not doing"},{"startMs":2230480,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"that what we're doing instead is"},{"startMs":2232920,"durationMs":8360,"subtitle":"creating what's called a hydroxy gas and"},{"startMs":2237760,"durationMs":4599,"subtitle":"includes both hydrogen and oxygen and in"},{"startMs":2241280,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"these"},{"startMs":2242359,"durationMs":10681,"subtitle":"bubbles okay and so Stanley took these"},{"startMs":2247640,"durationMs":8719,"subtitle":"Bubbles and fed it into his carburation"},{"startMs":2253040,"durationMs":6799,"subtitle":"system and that's what he used as

fuel"},{"startMs":2265440,"durationMs":6639,"subtitle":"and we'll get into that here next slide"},{"startMs":2269160,"durationMs":6199,"subtitle":"so what is water fuel what is this stuff"},{"startMs":2272079,"durationMs":5321,"subtitle":"that Stanley was producing as well as uh"},{"startMs":2275359,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"U Brown"},{"startMs":2277400,"durationMs":9160,"subtitle":"um this HHO Gas Browns"},{"startMs":2281200,"durationMs":9200,"subtitle":"gas um it's hydroxy gas oxyhydrogen gas"},{"startMs":2286560,"durationMs":7519,"subtitle":"it goes by several names and it's highly"},{"startMs":2290400,"durationMs":7199,"subtitle":"flammable okay the other curious thing"},{"startMs":2294079,"durationMs":7081,"subtitle":"about it is that the gas Burns cold it"},{"startMs":2297599,"durationMs":10480,"subtitle":"doesn't burn super hot and it burns at a"},{"startMs":2301160,"durationMs":9800,"subtitle":"temperature of 266 de F or 130° Cen"},{"startMs":2308079,"durationMs":7321,"subtitle":"but it can

more"},{"startMs":2336640,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"King wrote a book uh the key to new"},{"startMs":2339040,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"energy and I know it's"},{"startMs":2341280,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"available on Steve swick's website"},{"startMs":2347800,"durationMs":5799,"subtitle":"okay and it goes into a lot of detail on"},{"startMs":2350640,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"his Browns gas so I would call it fuel"},{"startMs":2353599,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"of the future you can replace gasoline"},{"startMs":2357160,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"with it okay so rather than burning"},{"startMs":2360079,"durationMs":6601,"subtitle":"gasoline you burn this uh this water"},{"startMs":2363240,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"this hydroxy gas and that's a project I"},{"startMs":2366680,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"want to work on as"},{"startMs":2368560,"durationMs":5559,"subtitle":"well so next"},{"startMs":2371079,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"slide and there's this apparatus

in"},{"startMs":2390760,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"China um so you can buy this water torch"},{"startMs":2394680,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and burn water okay because it makes the"},{"startMs":2397880,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"gas now in this case here you have to"},{"startMs":2400800,"durationMs":6319,"subtitle":"use a catalyst okay you see that

just"},{"startMs":4209040,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"grew I mean healthy it was a healthy"},{"startMs":4212560,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"plant so um I would say there's"},{"startMs":4215840,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"incredible health benefits uh with with"},{"startMs":4218880,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"the scaler"},{"startMs":4220800,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"wave and another researcher that comes"},{"startMs":4223840,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"to your conference as well um is

be"},{"startMs":4262800,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"like a link to his website for the"},{"startMs":4265600,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"hydrogen app okay can you talk about the"},{"startMs":4268880,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"reverse flyback votage regarding any of"},{"startMs":4271560,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"Baron's work

your"},{"startMs":4310760,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"input current starts to really drop and"},{"startMs":4313760,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"so you see these huge"},{"startMs":4316600,"durationMs":5079,"subtitle":"efficiencies in your device okay because"},{"startMs":4319800,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"the uh input current is"},{"startMs":4321679,"durationMs":4841,"subtitle":"dropping and this is what uh Floyd sweet"},{"startMs":4324679,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"saw on his device you know he had"},{"startMs":4326520,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"something like 10 million"},{"startMs":4328600,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"perc so he can go well over 100%

the"},{"startMs":4365639,"durationMs":5321,"subtitle":"past"},{"startMs":4367280,"durationMs":6359,"subtitle":"um but they're using it uh one
