the soft water bottle is soft because it has certain phthalates in it that's a hard"},{"startMs":488760,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"nasty word but um there it is and um it's those are chemicals that

distance"},{"startMs":726480,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"is much smaller in females than males I should say genetic females and males and"},{"startMs":735600,"durationMs":9120,"subtitle":"um about
