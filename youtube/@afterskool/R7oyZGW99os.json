numbers"},{"startMs":347440,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"are associated with the measures of geometry and here we have what i refer to as the alphabet"},{"startMs":354720,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"of sacred geometry and these are the simplest forms these are the polygons you have a circle"},{"startMs":360320,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"which is actually not a polygon but we have an equilateral triangle a square and a

sides so for example we look at a circle which is just a special case of an ellipse with"},{"startMs":377280,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"eccentricity of zero we've covered this already so let's go right to the equilateral triangle"},{"startMs":382960,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"and we'll see it's 60 60 and 60 which equals 180 degrees again notice that we've got the number 9"},{"startMs":389760,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"recurring we go to the square which is 4 times 90 degrees the total number of degrees defining"},{"startMs":396560,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"the square is 360 the same as the circle the same as the measure of a circle and we measure the"},{"startMs":403120,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"polygons by essentially measuring the angles of the

times"},{"startMs":417760,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"5 and you get 540. again notice everything adds up to nine for some strange reason 108 is going"},{"startMs":425920,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"to turn out to be a very important number it's a lunar number as you're going to see"},{"startMs":430880,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"108 anybody know what metal has an atomic weight of silver that i mean atomic weight of 108 yes"},{"startMs":437840,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"that's right it's silver very good all right so let's get into some of the solid tetrahedron"},{"startMs":446080,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"is this form right here and it's composed of four of the equilateral triangles so we have as it says"},{"startMs":454000,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"here there's four triangular faces four times 180 is 720 degrees that is the total angular measure"},{"startMs":462160,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"of this particular geometric form this is known as one of the platonic solids or regular polyhedra"},{"startMs":469040,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"polyhedra means multiple faces and the regular polyhedra is the family of five there's only five"},{"startMs":475920,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"that have the same shape or the same polygonal face in this case the equilateral triangle and"},{"startMs":484080,"durationMs":10480,"subtitle":"then we will move on to the cube and the cube is six faces and they're each square and we saw that"},{"startMs":494560,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"that each of those square faces had 360 degrees 6 times 360. the important thing is to grasp that"},{"startMs":502080,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"the total number of degrees in this form is 2160 2160 and we're going to find out that that number"},{"startMs":510960,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"actually turns out to be pretty significant in the measure of other parts of time and space"},{"startMs":518320,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"then we'll go to the octahedron and it has eight triangular faces"},{"startMs":525680,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"this is our octahedron right here and they're all you'll notice that so far the the tetrahedron"},{"startMs":531520,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and the octahedron are both composed of triangular equilateral triangular faces"},{"startMs":537280,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and essentially if you look at the difference between the tetrahedron and the octahedron"},{"startMs":541200,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"you could just imagine that if we could take the tetrahedron and split it along an edge"},{"startMs":545680,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"and insert a fourth triangular face it would cause it to flatten out somewhat and it would give us"},{"startMs":551840,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"the top half of the octahedron and likewise we could insert a fifth equilateral triangle in"},{"startMs":559440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"here and it's going to give us the icosahedron which i'll show you in a minute if we tried to"},{"startMs":563760,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"insert a sixth one though we discovered that the whole thing flattened out into two dimensions so"},{"startMs":569520,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"that wouldn't work as far as enclosing space so in any case notice we're seeing"},{"startMs":573840,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"a recurrence of this number that we saw 1440. remember we saw that number back right"},{"startMs":585680,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"right here the number of minutes in a day so let that that relationship sink in the number"},{"startMs":593520,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"of minutes in the time that it takes our earth to spin exactly once on its axis relative to the sun"},{"startMs":602560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"happens to be the same number of degrees that define the octahedron"},{"startMs":610560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and that's actually what we're talking about then when we're talking about a tropical or solar day"},{"startMs":614000,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"we're talking about one exactly one rotation of the earth on its axis relative to the sun"},{"startMs":622640,"durationMs":11280,"subtitle":"okay then we have the icosahedron"},{"startMs":636080,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"which is 20 faces all equilateral triangles you can see if you look at the vertex of this"},{"startMs":642240,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"thing you see that there are five faces clustered around each vertex so if we were to split an edge"},{"startMs":649280,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"insert another triangle what it would happen is it would flatten out into a hexagon a flat hexagon"},{"startMs":655680,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"with six equilateral triangles about its center in any case there are 20 of these triangular faces 20"},{"startMs":661600,"durationMs":10320,"subtitle":"times 180 is 3600 so again we have one of our nines and then our final is our dodecahedron"},{"startMs":673120,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"my favorite shape this is what plato referred to the dodecahedron as being"},{"startMs":677040,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"the the shape of the universe itself the dodecahedron you'll notice has uh"},{"startMs":683760,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"12 faces 20 vertices whereas the icosahedron has 20 faces and 12 vertices so they're duals of each"},{"startMs":691280,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"other we could actually suspend this icosahedron if the dodecahedron was hollow we could put it"},{"startMs":697120,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"inside we would discover that each corner of the icosahedron coincided with the center"},{"startMs":702560,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"of the pentagonal face of the doe decahedron okay each pentagonal face as we found out was a each"},{"startMs":709680,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"edge was 108 5 times 108 540 12 times 540 as it says is 6480. so again we've got a the number nine"},{"startMs":719840,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"redundantly occurring over and over again in these measures okay 6480 turns out to"},{"startMs":726240,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"be a critically important number as well as you're going to see as we proceed along here"},{"startMs":735600,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"oh and then we have the star tetrahedron which would be two tetrahedrons interlaced and i don't"},{"startMs":742560,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"have one of those today but if you can picture a tetrahedron like this and then one like this"},{"startMs":751120,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"interlaced it gives you this what's known as sometimes the star tetrahedron or the"},{"startMs":755840,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"stellated octahedron it is composed of two tetrahedrons each of 720 so here again now"},{"startMs":762560,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"you're seeing the repetition of this same number 1440 being the measure of the of the uh"},{"startMs":769520,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"star tetrahedron okay so now we're going to talk about time measures the first thing we're going to"},{"startMs":774960,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"look at is astrological time cycles i don't know how many of you have studied astrology"},{"startMs":781360,"durationMs":8320,"subtitle":"but in this particular scheme of time the total duration of the processional cycle which is 25"},{"startMs":789680,"durationMs":10800,"subtitle":"920 years this is the motion of the earth on its axis like this or you could think of it like this"},{"startMs":801920,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"the axis of the earth actually forms sort of an hourglass motion a long slow period of um"},{"startMs":808640,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"of
