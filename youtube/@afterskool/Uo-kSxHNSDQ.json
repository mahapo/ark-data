genetic"},{"startMs":397760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"okay so let's just put that aside okay not genetic all right so what are you left with"},{"startMs":402000,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"well causes are broadly classified into genes and environment okay so now we're on the environment"},{"startMs":408160,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"side okay so now what makes up environmental causes well i subdivide them into lifestyle"},{"startMs":416320,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"and that's very broad and i'll say a little more about that and then"},{"startMs":420240,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"chemical okay so there are other things perhaps but let's just talk about those so

and so on and"},{"startMs":678160,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"so forth all the all the parts start developing what happens if there isn't enough

late"},{"startMs":692240,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"it won't get completed so what that means is that it's going to be the default which is female"},{"startMs":699120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"this is a hard thing to imagine you know that the female is the default"},{"startMs":703360,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"but that's seems to

had heard from a friend on an airplane flying to japan he said shauna you should"},{"startMs":744880,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"look at phthalates i said why should i look at valids and he said well i'm a chemist i'm at cdc"},{"startMs":752160,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"we've been measuring these they're in everybody including pregnant women everybody

birth"},{"startMs":779600,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"there's fetal alcohol and there's the phthalate syndrome so that made it sound really important"},{"startMs":785040,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"so i asked him what that was and he told me that when a rat has been developing gestating"},{"startMs":792640,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"within a mother rat who's been fed phthalates at the right time then his genitals are all smaller"},{"startMs":801680,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"they're all smaller and less developed so his testicles might not be fully descended"},{"startMs":806880,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and the

measured it in our study they"},{"startMs":846240,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"measure it in the rat study so i heard about this rat study and i thought that's funny i wonder if"},{"startMs":851360,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"we'll see that in humans and so i designed a study to look at that it was the first study to do that"},{"startMs":858560,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"so it got turned out was kind of important um so we had urine stored from pregnant women"},{"startMs":866000,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and we sent them to cdc and we had cdc measure what's called the phthalic metabolites"},{"startMs":870880,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"phthalates which are chemicals that lower testosterone pass through the body really"},{"startMs":875360,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"quickly enter the urine the water soluble and you can measure them so we did that for about 800"},{"startMs":882000,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"women have the cdc measure their phthalates and then we said okay let's get the kids in"},{"startMs":888320,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and measure their genitals seems like a simple project right turned out it was"},{"startMs":893200,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"fairly complicated to do it was hard sometimes to find the kids and bring them in and all that but"},{"startMs":898160,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"we did that and we found the phthalate syndrome in humans so let me just reiterate we found that"},{"startMs":904400,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"when the mother had higher levels of certain phthalates those that lower testosterone in

to replicate this as you do with science we wrote another grant we got another big study"},{"startMs":935200,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"we got another set of pregnant women got their urine got their babies replicated it"},{"startMs":940240,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and found the same result so now it's pretty well established that that this is going on"},{"startMs":947680,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"there's two kickers here one is these children from our second study are now only 10 years old we"},{"startMs":954240,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"don't know how they're going to perform you know in terms of fertility and function later on they"},{"startMs":960560,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"first study the kids are actually in their 20s but they're really spread out around the country"},{"startMs":967680,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"and we're gonna try to get them in and get their sperm count but we don't know if we'll be able to"},{"startMs":973600,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"do that however in the rat we know that if the rat is born with a small in a gentle distance"},{"startMs":982400,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"then

doesn't"},{"startMs":1019760,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"matter well it turns out it matters for a lot of things it matters for genital birth defects he's"},{"startMs":1026880,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"more likely to have undescended testicles if he has a short agv he's more likely to have

phthalics are in plastic they make plastic soft and flexible so anytime you see a rubber tubing"},{"startMs":1088880,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"um i just saw a survey of clothing in which they measured phthalates levels in the clothing"},{"startMs":1096000,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and found that they were really high in the

phthalates"},{"startMs":1128480,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and so when the milk comes from the cow goes through the tube goes into the container

you"},{"startMs":1192640,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"come back 20 minutes later the cream's gone right it's meant to be absorbed phthalates help
