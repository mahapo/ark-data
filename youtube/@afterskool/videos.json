Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" is one of the most influential philosophical concepts ever introduced, encapsulating timeless questions about reality, knowledge, perception, and enlightenment. Located in Plato's seminal work, \"The Republic,\" the Allegory of the Cave serves as a metaphorical narrative depicting the human condition's journey from ignorance to enlightenment.\n\nThe Athenian philosopher Plato (c. 428-347 B.C.) is one of the most important figures of the Ancient Greek world and the entire history of Western thought. In his written dialogues he conveyed and expanded on the ideas and techniques of his teacher Socrates.\n\nThe Academy he founded was by some accounts the world’s first university and in it he trained his greatest student, the equally influential philosopher Aristotle. Plato’s recurring fascination was the distinction between ideal forms and everyday experience, and how it played out both for individuals and for societies. In the “Republic,” his most famous work, he envisioned a civilization governed not by lowly appetites but by the pure wisdom of a philosopher-king.\n\nThis script was written and recorded by Agrippa's Diary.

Numerous literary critics regard him as one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his works are considered highly influential masterpieces.\n\nDostoevsky's literary works explore the human condition in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). His 1864 novella Notes from Underground is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist literature.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into Saint Petersburg's literary circles. However, he was arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group, the Petrashevsky Circle, that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia. Dostoevsky was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian writers.\n\nDostoevsky's body of work consists of thirteen novels, three novellas, seventeen short stories, and numerous other works. His writings were widely read both within and beyond his native Russia and influenced an equally great number of later writers including Russians such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Anton Chekhov, philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the emergence of Existentialism and Freudianism. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages, and served as the inspiration for many films.\n\nThis script was written and recorded by Eternalised.

His best-selling 1971 book Be Here Now, which has been described by multiple reviewers as \"seminal\", helped popularize Eastern spirituality and yoga in the West. He authored or co-authored twelve more books on spirituality over the next four decades, including Grist for the Mill (1977), How Can I Help? (1985), and Polishing the Mirror (2013).\n\nRam Dass was personally and professionally associated with Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Then known as Richard Alpert, he conducted research with Leary on the therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs. In addition, Alpert assisted Harvard Divinity School graduate student Walter Pahnke in his 1962 \"Good Friday Experiment\" with theology students, the first controlled, double-blind study of drugs and the mystical experience. While not illegal at the time, their research was controversial and led to Leary's and Alpert's dismissal from Harvard in 1963.\n\nIn 1967, Alpert traveled to India and became a disciple of Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba who gave him the name Ram Dass, meaning \"Servant of Ram,\" but usually rendered as simply \"Servant of God\" for western audiences. In the coming years, he founded the charitable organizations Seva Foundation and Hanuman Foundation. He traveled extensively giving talks and retreats and holding fundraisers for charitable causes in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. In 1997, he had a stroke which left him with paralysis and expressive aphasia. He eventually grew to interpret this event as an act of grace, learning to speak again and continuing to teach and write books. After becoming seriously ill during a trip to India in 2004, he gave up traveling and moved to Maui, Hawaii, where he hosted annual retreats with other spiritual teachers until his death in 2019.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLGZeoC9WMs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLGZeoC9WMs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLGZeoC9WMs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLGZeoC9WMs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLGZeoC9WMs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":10,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"yLGZeoC9WMs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"RjB3b_aAWEiwS63XIqlob3RNBYw","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLk1hNFZaN3J4R093","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-09T15:32:07Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"The Slow Poison of Endless Fantasy","description":"A young knight with a bright future is enticed by a spirit that has the ability to show him whatever vision he wants to see.

Regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all time, he was dubbed \"the dean of counterculture comedians\". He was known for his dark humor and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo subjects. \n\nThe first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977, broadcast as George Carlin at USC. From the late 1980s onwards, his routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on American political issues and satirized American culture. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975. His final comedy special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death from cardiac failure. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. \n\nThe audio in this video is from George Carlin's 1990 HBO special, \"Doin' it Again\".\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! after-skool.creator-spring.com\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

They were outlined by famed author Hermes Trismegistus, who is believed to have written the Emerald Tablet and the Corpus Hermeticum (two highly influential, ancient teachings).\n\nHis work would go on to influence both ancient Greek and Egyptian cultures, with both adopting him as a god of wisdom. (In Greece he was called Hermes; in Egypt, Thoth.) He was known in his time as a great master of the universe and is said to have lived for thousands of years.\n\nOver time, the seven hermetic principles were passed down by word-of-mouth from teacher to student, and eventually, one day in the early 20th century, the teachings were compiled into a book called The Kybalion, written by \"The Three Initiates.\" Today, they remain an occult source of wisdom, separate from any real religion but powerful nonetheless.\n\nAnd while the seven principles are just one way of understanding the universe, they aren't so constricting that they cannot be studied alongside other spiritual philosophies. \n\nHuge thank you to Sarah Elkhaldy (The Alchemist) for this wonderful collaboration.

Could this explain some of the social changes as well?\n\n0:00 - New Findings\n3:44 - What's causing this?\n11:11 - Anogenital Distance\n15:52 - Where does this all lead?\n17:46 - Population Decline\n25:40 - Addiction to plastic\n29:07 - LGBTQ & Endocrine Disruptors \n36:08 - What to do if you want kids\n39:06 - Future research\n\nOne important thing to note - products that don't contain phthalates and Bisphenol are more expensive. Services, like assisted reproduction, can only be accessed by those who can afford it. The ability to have a baby has become something of a class issue as well.\n\nFor more info about Dr. Swan visit here website https://www.shannaswan.com/\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! https://after-skool.creator-spring.com/\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

Jung's work has been influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology, and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous Burghölzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler. During this time, he came to the attention of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. The two men conducted a lengthy correspondence and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as president of his newly founded International Psychoanalytical Association. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to follow his older colleague's doctrine and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex and extraversion and introversion.\n\nIn this video, we explore Carl Jung's concept of the shadow and how to integrate it into our personality to attain wholeness. \n\nThis script was written and recorded by Eternalised.

But just as often, it's the viewers hypnotizing the performer. This disease, of which Perry is but one victim of many, is known as audience capture, and it's essential to understanding influencers in particular and the onlineecosystem in general.\n\nAudience capture is an irresistible force in the world of influencing, because it's not just a conscious\nprocess but also an unconscious one. While it may ostensibly appear to be a simple case of influencers making a business decision to create more of the content they believe audiences want, and then being incentivized by engagement numbers to remain in this niche forever, it's actually deeper than that.

He was still Dr. Richard Alpert, a prominent Harvard psychologist and psychedelic pioneer with Dr. Timothy Leary. He continued his psychedelic research until that fateful Eastern trip in 1967, when he traveled to India. In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means “servant of God.” Everything changed then – his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words “Be Here Now” ever since. Ram Dass’ spirit has been a guiding light for three generations, carrying along millions on the journey, helping to free them from their bonds as he works through his own.\n\nSince 1968, Ram Dass has pursued a panoramic array of spiritual methods and practices from potent ancient wisdom traditions, including bhakti or devotional yoga focused on the Hindu deity Hanuman; Buddhist meditation in the Theravadin, Mahayana Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist schools, and Sufi and Jewish mystical studies. Perhaps most significantly, his practice of karma yoga or spiritual service has opened up millions of other souls to their deep, yet individuated spiritual practice and path. Ram Dass continues to uphold the boddhisatva ideal for others through his compassionate sharing of true knowledge and vision. His unique skill in getting people to cut through and feel divine love without dogma is still a positive influence on many people from all over the planet.\n\nLearn more at https://www.ramdass.org/\n\nFull lecture of this audio can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ0lA8KtQhk&t=4s\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! after-skool.creator-spring.com\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory. With 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries.\n\nNikola Tesla & Thomas Edison\nTesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay $50,000 (Worth roughly 1.5 million today) for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.\n\nThank you to Voices of the Past for this epic collaboration.

Are Mushrooms USING US to Get to Space?","description":"This video is a collaboration with Fungi Academy, a Fungal Education Center based in Guatemala. They produce amazing online & in-person courses!\nDive deep into the world of mycology with the Fungi Academy for just $7! https://fungiacademy.com/mycology-101/\nSubscribe to the Fungi Academy Youtube channel for more Free Fungal Education. https://www.youtube.com/fungiacademy\n\nIn this video, Jasper from Fungi Academy explores the idea of Panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and planetoids, as well as by spacecraft carrying unintended contamination by microorganisms. The Lichen and Fungi Experiment on the International Space Station has discovered just how durable some life can be in space. These new findings have birthed the hypothesis that life may not have started on earth at all. Fungi are shown to survive the vacuum of space, potentially for eons! They have the tools at their disposal to basically terraform a planet into a lush, thriving environment that could one day evolve into an organism like our ancestors. The fungi then created a compound that would help that organism develop its brain, consciousness, and therefore its technologies. This evolution comes with a trait, looking at the sky to see what's out there, our innate curiosity making us who we are. Fungal entheogens amplify this and before you know it, this organism it birthed is shooting rockets into space, rockets filled and covered with fungal spores, ready to colonize the rest of the galaxy.\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! https://after-skool.creator-spring.com/\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nSong at the end: Content by Terry Tertiary\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

He was still Dr. Richard Alpert, a prominent Harvard psychologist and psychedelic pioneer with Dr. Timothy Leary. He continued his psychedelic research until that fateful Eastern trip in 1967, when he traveled to India. In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means “servant of God.” Everything changed then – his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words “Be Here Now” ever since. Ram Dass’ spirit has been a guiding light for three generations, carrying along millions on the journey, helping to free them from their bonds as he works through his own.\n\nSince 1968, Ram Dass has pursued a panoramic array of spiritual methods and practices from potent ancient wisdom traditions, including bhakti or devotional yoga focused on the Hindu deity Hanuman; Buddhist meditation in the Theravadin, Mahayana Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist schools, and Sufi and Jewish mystical studies. Perhaps most significantly, his practice of karma yoga or spiritual service has opened up millions of other souls to their deep, yet individuated spiritual practice and path. Ram Dass continues to uphold the boddhisatva ideal for others through his compassionate sharing of true knowledge and vision. His unique skill in getting people to cut through and feel divine love without dogma is still a positive influence on many people from all over the planet.\n\nLearn more at https://www.ramdass.org/\n\nFull lecture of this audio can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjh1BAG5Pfs&t=3556s\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! https://after-skool.creator-spring.com/\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

He was still Dr. Richard Alpert, a prominent Harvard psychologist and psychedelic pioneer with Dr. Timothy Leary. He continued his psychedelic research until that fateful Eastern trip in 1967, when he traveled to India. In India, he met his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately known as Maharajji, who gave Ram Dass his name, which means “servant of God.” Everything changed then – his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words “Be Here Now” ever since. Ram Dass’ spirit has been a guiding light for three generations, carrying along millions on the journey, helping to free them from their bonds as he works through his own.\n\nSince 1968, Ram Dass has pursued a panoramic array of spiritual methods and practices from potent ancient wisdom traditions, including bhakti or devotional yoga focused on the Hindu deity Hanuman; Buddhist meditation in the Theravadin, Mahayana Tibetan, and Zen Buddhist schools, and Sufi and Jewish mystical studies. Perhaps most significantly, his practice of karma yoga or spiritual service has opened up millions of other souls to their deep, yet individuated spiritual practice and path. Ram Dass continues to uphold the boddhisatva ideal for others through his compassionate sharing of true knowledge and vision. His unique skill in getting people to cut through and feel divine love without dogma is still a positive influence on many people from all over the planet.\n\nLearn more at https://www.ramdass.org/\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nVisit our site at https://www.afterskool.net/\nCheck out the new After Skool prints! https://after-skool.creator-spring.com/\nOr send us an email at afterskool100@gmail.com\n\nPlease share, like, comment, subscribe and hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future videos.

A mass psychosis is an epidemic of madness and it occurs when a large portion of a society loses touch with reality and descends into delusions. Such a phenomenon is not a thing of fiction. Two examples of mass psychoses are the American and European witch hunts 16th and 17th centuries and the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century.\n\nThis video will aim to answer questions surrounding mass psychosis: What is it? How does is start? Has it happened before? Are we experiencing one right now? And if so, how can the stages of a mass psychosis be reversed?\n\nThis video took a tremendous amount of work.

Stem cell biologist, bestselling author of The Biology of Belief and recipient of the 2009 Goi Peace Award, he has been a guest speaker on hundreds of TV and radio shows, as well as keynote presenter for national and international conferences.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Lipton began examining the principles of quantum physics and how they might be integrated into his understanding of the cell’s information processing systems. He produced breakthrough studies on the cell membrane, which revealed that this outer layer of the cell was an organic homologue of a computer chip, the cell’s equivalent of a brain. His research at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, between 1987 and 1992, revealed that the environment, operating though the membrane, controlled the behavior and physiology of the cell, turning genes on and off. His discoveries, which ran counter to the established scientific view that life is controlled by the genes, presaged one of today’s most important fields of study, the science of epigenetics. Two major scientific publications derived from these studies defined the molecular pathways connecting the mind and body. Many subsequent papers by other researchers have since validated his concepts and ideas.\n\nGet the After Skool Kid's Book - Why Don't Country Flags Use The Color Purple? https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nAdditional videography provided by Alex Lipton\nPlease follow Dr. Bruce Lipton for more great content! https://www.youtube.com/user/biologyofbelief","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM5w3EjikdA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM5w3EjikdA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM5w3EjikdA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM5w3EjikdA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM5w3EjikdA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":59,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nM5w3EjikdA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qFAMSEDqGhHIMYLc7X6sjJrWBdE","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLjR5YUJKVmZ5eTAw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-06-08T14:51:40Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"The False Idea of Who You Are - Alan Watts","description":"Speech extract from \"What is Life About?\" by Alan Watts, courtesy of https://alanwatts.org \n\nAlan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a well-known British philosopher, writer and speaker, best known for his interpretation of Eastern philosophy for Western audiences.

Joseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's best-known work is his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.\n\nSince the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theories have been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga.\n\nCampbell's approach to folklore topics such as myth and his influence on popular culture has been the subject of criticism, including from folklorists, academics in folklore studies.\n\nPlease consider supporting After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nIf you want to get in touch, feel free to send an email of visit https://www.afterskool.net\n\nAnd please subscribe and hit the notifications bell to see future animations!

So it can actually be more dangerous to be injured in a busy train station than out in the woods. The bystander effect is such a powerful psychological phenomena that many states and countries have enacted laws to counteract this. The Good Samaritan laws were created to encourage people to step up and help someone who is in trouble. It is seen as our ethical, moral and legal obligation to help when we are able to. Failure to do so can result in fines, lawsuits or in extreme cases, jail time. \n\nSadly, many people in modern society spend so much time staring at screens, that they have become detached from reality. When conflict arises, many people’s first reaction is to whip out their phones and record a tragedy unfold. And these tragedies are uploaded to the web for everyone on earth to see. The misfortunes of 7.8 billion people are broadcast onto our screens for us to mindlessly consume to the point where we become numb and disassociate these events from reality. As a result, when real situations happen right in front of us, the conditioned response is to record the event rather than try to offer help. \n\nWith all the chaos in the news and on social media, We can often feel powerless to affect any change on a macro level. How can your kindness and empathy have any impact on tragic events happening on the other side of the world? And the truth is, it can’t. There is nothing you can do to affect the events you see on your screen. The reality is, we can’t change the world. But...we can change ourselves. We have the power to change who we are, to shape ourselves into a beacon of good, to do the right thing, be mindful, be kind, act on compassion and take the high road. And if we all followed in the footsteps of the Good Samaritan, this world would change overnight. You may not be able to change the world, but always remember, you have the power to change yourself, and THAT will change the world. “Be the change you want to see in the world.” - Gandhi\n\nIf you act on compassion when the moment presents itself, you will have a meaningful life. Mark Twain said it best, “You’re never wrong to do the right thing.” So the next time you see someone in need, don’t ask the question “Is this my neighbor?”, the far more important question is, “Am I being a neighbor?” Don’t be the bystander that stays in the dark. Do as the Good Samaritan and you will move closer to a life of purpose. \n\nAdditional animation provided courtesy of Share Faith Kids https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTlThMcv2OFj7KfbOFhLrvg\n\nGet the After Skool Kid's Book - Why Don't Country Flags Use The Color Purple? - https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nSpecial thank you to Pastor Terry Brisbane for inspiring this video.

Please subscribe! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx_iw\nWe live in a world that is designed to stimulate our emotions. Every advertisement, food product and social media post is geared to give us a short rush of pleasure which is followed by an emptiness and a craving for more. Big companies are able to leverage our cravings and make trillions of dollars off of keeping us addicted. If you don’t have a plan for yourself, you will be at the mercy of companies who will play on your impulses to control you like a puppet. You will sacrifice your free will, searching for happiness in a maze that’s designed to keep you lost. Studies show that on average, people use their smartphones for about 3 hours per day [1,2]. That’s 1,095 hours every year. Thankfully there is a way to regain control over your impulses and take your power back through a practice called dopamine fasting.\n\nDopamine fasting is the idea that if you avoid dopamine stimulating activities for extended periods of time, you will be able to ‘reset your brain’ and let go of addictive behaviors that negatively impact your life. It’s commonly misunderstood as reducing dopamine, but that’s not true. Dopamine is necessary to function as a healthy human being.\n\nDopamine Fasting exploded in interest in October 2018 and gained even more interest a year later after Dr. Cameron Sepah published an article on Medium titled ‘The Definitive Guide to Dopamine Fasting 2.0: The Hot Silicon Valley Trend.\n\nDopamine fasting 2.0 is better defined. It’s based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. It’s about reducing impulsive behavior, not reducing dopamine itself. And it doesn’t encourage you to act like a full-blown monk who abstains from all forms of pleasure.\n\nGet the After Skool Kid's Book - Why Don't Country Flags Use The Color Purple? - https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nFollow on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/afterskool100/?hl=en\nand Facebook https://www.facebook.com/afterskool100\n\nAnimation at the end was produced by CeoQDisney https://www.instagram.com/ceoqdisney/?hl=en\n\nReferences\n1.

Stem cell biologist, bestselling author of The Biology of Belief and recipient of the 2009 Goi Peace Award, he has been a guest speaker on hundreds of TV and radio shows, as well as keynote presenter for national and international conferences.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Lipton began examining the principles of quantum physics and how they might be integrated into his understanding of the cell’s information processing systems. He produced breakthrough studies on the cell membrane, which revealed that this outer layer of the cell was an organic homologue of a computer chip, the cell’s equivalent of a brain. His research at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, between 1987 and 1992, revealed that the environment, operating though the membrane, controlled the behavior and physiology of the cell, turning genes on and off. His discoveries, which ran counter to the established scientific view that life is controlled by the genes, presaged one of today’s most important fields of study, the science of epigenetics. Two major scientific publications derived from these studies defined the molecular pathways connecting the mind and body. Many subsequent papers by other researchers have since validated his concepts and ideas.\n\nGet the After Skool Kid's Book - Why Don't Country Flags Use The Color Purple? https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Country-Flags-Color-Purple/dp/0578489244\nGet in touch via https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nAdditional artwork by Alex Grey\nSong at the end: Mars by Stellardrone\nAudio clips from LR.tv \n\nAnd please hit the notifications bell so you don't miss future animations!

As we develop new methods for uncovering the ice, we are beginning to see the possibilities that lay below. Mainstream ideology puts forward the \"Out of Africa\" theory, which tracks humans originating in Africa and spreading out by land across the world.

Activities like hanging stockings and singing songs about flying reindeer have become so deeply ingrained in Christmas, that we don’t even wonder where they came from. When we trace the origin of Christmas traditions, we find that many of them may be linked to the rituals surrounding the Psychedelic mushroom, Amanita muscaria. The large red, white spotted Amanita Muscaria is the most recognizable mushroom on earth.

Go subscribe to their channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPr6DPtJISy8DL9eGAIiyA\nIt’s said that the left side is mostly in charge of logical behavior such as mathematics, putting things in sequence, language, facts and so on. The right brain has more creative parts like; imagination, intuition, visualizing your feelings and all that kind of thing\n\nBecause of this, it’s become a common idea that most people are either left-brained or right brained, just like they are left or right handed. The accounts, lawyers and bankers are all smart, serious left brainers. The painters, musicians and hairdressers are all wild and impulsive right brainers. \n\nBut is this really true? Can you have a dominant side of your brain? \n\nThe answer is no. And your brain is also nowhere near as divided as most people believe. The two sides are much more similar than we think and most processes are found on both sides. The two parts do have different functions but they are not divided up as simply as logic on one side, creativity on the other. \n\nFor more interesting animations, please subscribe! and hit the notifications bell! \nTo get our book or hire us to make your company an animation, please visit https://www.afterskool.net/\nPlease support us Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/left-brain-vs-right-brain#staying-sharp\nhttps://www.livescience.com/32935-whats-the-difference-between-the-right-brain-and-left-brain.html\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-when-half-brain-better-than-whole/\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-theory-cognitive-modes/201401/left-brain-right-brain-wrong","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BxJKrw4TAc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BxJKrw4TAc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BxJKrw4TAc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BxJKrw4TAc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BxJKrw4TAc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":119,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_BxJKrw4TAc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"BYBJoebwW17d6Ld5rkjCYaZlvMU","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLnNsU0xMSmJlbzNZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-02-19T17:00:13Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"War On DRUGS or A War On the MIND?","description":"Take an introductory look at the founding practices and propaganda surrounding the development and prohibition of psychedelic use in our society. http://bit.ly/Take_a_PsychedelicJourney  When scientific study and ancient ritual point toward psychedelics as a tool for healing and awakening, why are these age-old plants regarded as harmful?

They make learning fun and easy.\n\nAccording to the theory of relativity, time dilation is a difference in the elapsed time measured by two observers, either due to a velocity difference relative to each other, or by being differently situated relative to a gravitational field. As a result of the nature of spacetime, a clock that is moving relative to an observer will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer's own frame of reference. A clock that is under the influence of a stronger gravitational field than an observer's will also be measured to tick slower than the observer's own clock.\n\nSuch time dilation has been repeatedly demonstrated, for instance by small disparities in a pair of atomic clocks after one of them is sent on a space trip, or by clocks on the Space Shuttle running slightly slower than reference clocks on Earth, or clocks on GPS and Galileo satellites running slightly faster. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel.\nCorrection: Einstein published the his theory of Special Relativity in 1905, not 1919.

Humans have been infatuated with gold for as long as we have recorded history. Millions have died for it, entire civilizations were build upon it and even many cryptocurrencies are backed by it. Gold was the driving force in the European conquest of the Americas in search of places like El Dorado, a city entirely made of Gold. And we can’t forget the mass migration to the western United States in the Gold Rush of 1849. Even the gods wanted gold. According to the Sumerian tablets, the oldest written record we have, gold was the entire reason for creating mankind.\n\nAside from being shiny, Gold is incredibly durable and malleable. It does not corrode or rust like other metals. It can easily be shaped into statues or coins that stand the test of time. But there are many practical uses for Gold. Nasa uses gold on their spaceships and astronaut suits because it blocks harmful radiation rays. On a monatomic level, it can used to achieve profound health benefits. Gold is not toxic and integrates well with the biology of the human body. It is used to detect cancer cells and in certain cased has even been known to attack and destroy prostate cancer cells. When injected into joints, gold can reduce pain, swelling, damage and arthritis. \n\nHowever, gold is extremely scarce. All the gold we have on earth came to us from asteroids that crashed here 200 millions years after the earth was formed. There is no way for humans reproduce gold, so every ounce has to be mined.

They make learning fun and easy.\n\nIf you're interesting in hiring us to create an animation for your company, please visit https://www.afterskool.net/services/ for details!\n\nMagnum opus is a latin term that is defined as someone’s greatest life achievement. It is the highest intersection of talent, skill and hard work, when someone reaches their maximum potential at the exact right time in the exact right place.\nEveryone has a massive amount of potential, whether it be an invention, a painting, a song, a journey, a book, an idea, you name it, but very few actually get to flourish and reach for that potential. When you’re a young child, you hold the belief that anything is possible, no dream is too big...so what happens between childhood and adulthood that crushes so many dreams? Why do so many settle? Is it the school system? Is it “realistic” expectations? Financial fear? Practicality? A lack of belief? \n\nThe reason people don’t attempt their magnum opus is because of doubt. Doubt is the ultimate crippler of ambition. In order to believe in yourself, you must have evidence to support this belief. It’s like a table. Your belief is the table-top and the legs are experiences and evidence that support the belief. Doubt is like a woodpecker, that chips away at the legs of the table. When enough doubt creeps into your mind, the table comes crashing down and you no longer believe in yourself. The key is to reverse this process. Move toward beliefs that empower you, then find role models, experiences, stories and evidence to support the new empowering belief. Most importantly, do not listen to the doubters. Doubters are cynical people who have never attempted what you’re setting out to do. Buddha said, “we are what we think, all that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.” Achieving your goal starts with the mental belief that it can be done. Attitude is far more important than IQ.\n\nIt may seem scary and unfamiliar, for the path to your magnum opus is never easy. You will have to be willing to take risks, sacrifice, and to go the extra mile. At the end of this short life, you want to look back and say, i gave it my all. I took a shot, and left it all on the line. \n\nThis simple exercise can help you focus your energy and home in on your magnum opus journey. Write down things you love to do, things you’re good at and things people will pay you to do. The intersection of these 3 categories is your “sweet spot”. Perhaps you can combine things from all 3 categories. The key to reaching your magnum opus is to find your sweet spot and take action.\n\nFor more interesting animations, please subscribe!

A backlash against the hippy counterculture – “the war on drugs” – halted research into psychedelics. In 1971, the UK parliament introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act, classifying psilocybin, LSD and DMT as illegal class A drugs. All further research on psychedelics was banned. \n\nThe definition of a schedule 1 drug, which the most illegal classification, is a substance that has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Since the 1970’s there has been strong advocacy to take cannabis off the schedule 1 list. Cannabis has been found to improve many health issues, such as seizures, sleep disorders and arthritis. Although cannabis still remains on the schedule 1 list today, The evidence is so strong in favor of medicinal marijuana that it has become legalized in over half the U.S states and many countries around the world. \n\nThe legalization of cannabis has opened the door to re-examine the possible medical benefits of other currently illegal substances, like psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and DMT. The first new studies in over 30 years are finding that these so called dangerous drugs can have a profound positive impact on mental health when used properly.\nDepression is a growing problem and antidepressants continue not to work for up to half of the people who take them. A recent study examined the treatment of 20 patients suffering from depression. Half took antidepressants and half took psilocybin. After three months, the antidepressant effects were found to be greater for those taking psilocybin than for people taking typical antidepressants and therapy. Patients said they went from feeling “totally disconnected” with themselves and the world to “connected”, and from repressing and avoiding emotions and memories to accepting them.\nUnlike antidepressants, which are taken daily, psilocybin therapy would take place a few times over a series of months until the patient decides that they no longer need it. \n\nIn most cases, only a few sessions of psilocybin are needed to bring about permanent change. Other research has found a similar positive impact on depression with the use of LSD, DMT and Ketamine. The push for more research on psychedelics is growing fast, but we still need a much deeper understanding before this becomes mainstream.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CMNzRTEjoyA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CMNzRTEjoyA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CMNzRTEjoyA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CMNzRTEjoyA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":131,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"CMNzRTEjoyA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"TwqDsHWmNgOgFD752rp7X2mcHeY","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLlFDNkhGRUlndkRN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-08-21T16:23:37Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"PLAYING GOD - The Story of Synthetic Life","description":"Head over the Professor Dave's Channel for some really awesome educational videos! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA\n\nIn 2016, the first synthetic organism of original design was created. When you hear this statement, what does it make you think of? The word synthetic does imply that something was built by man. But if you’re imagining artificial intelligence, or robots, or anything mechanical, you’re way off the mark. Synthetic life refers to actual, biological, living organisms. How can such a thing be synthesized? To put this achievement into context, let’s examine the history of chemical synthesis. Up until the early 19th century, it was a widespread belief that living organisms, along with all the stuff inside them, had some kind of special essence, or life-energy. These substances could only come from other life, and not from non-life. This notion was called vitalism. But in 1828, Friedrich Wohler proved that this is not the case by synthesizing urea, a compound found in the human body. On that day, organic chemistry was born. In the decades that followed, chemists learned how to synthesize all kinds of compounds, and by the latter half of the 20th century, this field had become incredibly sophisticated, thanks to an expansive understanding of the molecular world. In 1972, a team led by Robert Burns Woodward completed a landmark synthesis of Vitamin B-12, and other efforts have yielded the possibility of mass producing compounds for use in medicine, or as materials for the development of new technologies.\n\nBut in a way, an echo of vitalism persists to this day. There are those who think that if humans synthesize a natural product, like a vitamin, that it must be inferior to one that nature makes. This is not so. Nature builds these molecules just like we do, and it has its own biosynthetic pathways to make them. But nature’s laboratory is inside living organisms. These are delicate systems, so chemistry must be done at a very specific temperature and pH, and only with the materials at hand. In our own laboratories, we have no such limitations. We can put whatever we want in a flask and heat it up, cool it down, use strong acids and bases, exotic compounds that don’t exist in nature, and most importantly, sentience. We can decide what chemistry to do, rather than relying on the chemistry that nature has stumbled upon by blind chance over the millenia. For this reason, we can do chemistry that nature simply can’t, and we can often arrive at the same products with much greater efficiency. Whatever the molecule might be, if nature makes it, or we make it, there’s no difference. If two molecules have the same atoms connected in the same way, they’re the same, no matter how they got there. If this were not true, the field of organic chemistry could not exist, and the field is thriving, to say the least.\n\nFrom simple molecules, we soon learned how to synthesize large biomolecules, like proteins and DNA. We developed techniques like solid phase peptide synthesis, which makes it absolutely trivial to synthesize any protein we want. The advent of CRISPR and gene-editing technology has made it easy to edit DNA sequences. And now, Craig Venter and his team have taken the next step. Syn 3.0 is an entire synthetic genome, consisting of only 473 genes, the fewest of any living organism. This genome, when expressed, takes the form of a single-celled organism, one that has never existed in nature. It was invented, created, built, manifested, whatever verb you want to use, by mankind. If going by a certain definition of a god, we are now one, as we have created life.\n\nSynthetic life is the final nail in the coffin for vitalism. What chemists have known for almost two hundred years is now clear as day for all to see. The ingredients of life can be built by humans. Beyond synthesizing basic organic compounds, we can now create an entire self-replicating living organism from scratch. What is the next step? Synthetic microorganisms that rapidly consume carbon dioxide to counteract climate change? Others that produce clean fuels? Could we even make synthetic plants and animals, creating entirely new species dreamt up purely by imagination? What should we create, and what shouldn’t we create? Time will tell, but the possibilities are truly endless.\n\nPlease Support After Skool on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\nTo Check out the After Skool Graphic Novel visit our website https://www.afterskool.net/\nFor more weekly animations, please subscribe!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QC6HFEIgvDM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QC6HFEIgvDM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QC6HFEIgvDM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QC6HFEIgvDM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":132,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QC6HFEIgvDM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Fi3LtyMM4SqK_g5HmRrkHxdnMuY","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLnJzS3c1QmtXZXN3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-08-14T16:44:48Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"Privacy is NO LONGER a Social Norm","description":"If you want to protect your privacy online then a VPN is critical. Visit https://NordVPN.com/afterskool to get 77% off a 3 year plan and use code: AFTERSKOOL\n\nThe average American spends a over 30 hours a week on the internet. Every second you are online, your behavior is being tracked and stored into a file that can be sold to companies trying to sell products to you. Even when you’re not online, your phone is listening. In this age of technology, privacy seems to be something of the past. There is an illusion that the internet is free, but the fact is your personal information is worth a lot, and you end up paying dearly for it in the end.\n\nTo most people, the lack of privacy doesn’t seem like a big deal. Constant surveillance goes hand in hand with the internet. Only 3% of people who use google have actually read the terms and conditions that they agreed to. There is a sentiment today that only “bad people” want privacy. Only those with things to hide care about privacy. But the fact of the matter is we all do things when we think we’re alone that we would never do out in public. There are things we say to those we trust in confidence that would mortify us if they were got out. \n\nWhen we’re in a state where we are being monitored our behavior changes. There are plenty of social science experiments to back this up. One the most famous experiments was developed by an English Philosopher named Jeremy Bentham in 1791. At the time, prisons in England were overcrowded and there weren’t enough guards to keep order. So Bentham designed a new type of prison structure, called the panopticon, which allowed all inmates to be observed at all times by a single guard. In the panopticon prison, every inmate was separated into a cell that faced inward towards one guard tower. The guard in the tower sat in the dark and stared out through a tiny window which was covered with shutters; so the guard could see out and no one could see in. Since the inmates could not see the guard in the tower, it created the illusion that they were being watched at all times. This design had such a profound impact on the inmates behavior, that all riots and resistance ceased. Just knowing that they were visible was enough to keep the inmates in line. In fact, In order for this to work, they didn’t even need a guard in the tower. All that was needed was the fear of potentially being watched at all times. \n\nconstant surveillance creates a prison in the mind. The panopticon proved to be the ultimate enforcer of obedience and compliance and this same principle has been carried over to schools, hospitals, airports, the workplace and now practically every public corner of society. \n\nTo those in authoritative power, Anyone who poses a meaningful challenge to authority must be stopped. So Essentially, If you completely render yourself harmless and conforming in every way possible as someone who poses no threat whatsoever, then you have nothing to worry about. . \n\nHere’s a powerful quote from 19th century philosopher, Rosa Luxemburg “Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.”\n\nMaybe not today, but someday you will want to explore an idea that doesn’t conform to the ever narrowing standards of society and when that time comes wouldn’t you like the freedom to act without being judged or surveillanced. Privacy is a basic human right.\n\nFor more interesting videos please subscribe.

Our materialist science reduces everything to matter, materialist science in the West says that we are just meat, we’re just our bodies. So when the brain is dead, that’s the end of consciousness, there is no life after death, there is no soul; we just rot and are gone. Actually, many honest scientists should admit that consciousness is the greatest mystery of science and that we don’t know exactly how it works. The brain is involved in it some way but we’re not sure how. It could be that the brain generates consciousness the way a generator makes electricity, if you hold to that paradigm, then of course you can’t believe in life after death, when the generator’s broken, consciousness is gone. But it’s equally possible that the relationship — and nothing in neuroscience rules it out – that the relationship is more like the relationship of the TV signal to the TV set, and in that case, when the TV set is broken, of course the TV signal continues. And this is the paradigm of all spiritual traditions, that we are immortal souls temporarily incarnated in these physical forms.\n\nIf we want to understand consciousness, the last people we should ask are materialist scientists. Instead, we should look at ancient cultures, like the Egyptians, who highly valued dream states. Many ancient cultures around the world used hallucinogenic plants to understand consciousness and expand their minds. \n\nHowever in today's society, visionary plants are highly illegal because they promote a state of consciousness that does not agree with the agenda of profit. Substances, like coffee, alcohol, sugar and pharmaceuticals, are forced upon the population, but possession of even small quantities of cannabis, Ayahuasca or psilocybin will land you in jail. If we do not recognize the right of adult sovereignty over consciousness, then we can NOT claim to be free. \n\nLook at what our moderns state of consciousness has done. We have destroyed the natural gifts of earth in pursuit of short-term, selfish gain. We must reconnect with spirit immediately or else we will encounter disaster. Visionary plants could be the remedy for our current sickness. \n\nDisclaimer: We are not promoting risky, illegal or dangerous behavior. Do your research before taking any action. Visionary plants are not meant for partying. They should be used responsibly, in moderation and under experienced supervision.\n\nFor more info visit https://grahamhancock.com/\nor follow\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Author.GrahamHancock/\n\nIf you'd like to get involved and help us produce more animations like this, please support After Skool on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool/overview\n\nTo get the After Skool graphic novel visit our site https://www.afterskool.net/\n\nThis was audio was taken from a banned TedTalk in 2013.

In the video we collaborate with Health Chronicle to bring you the answer. Check out their fun health animations https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPr6DPtJISy8DL9eGAIiyA\n\nIn 2007, Researchers at the University of Bordeaux conducted a study where They equipped rat cages with two levers: one lever gave the rats an intravenous hit of cocaine; the other gave them 20 seconds to drink sugar water. Before beginning the tests, rats were allowed to sample each lever twice to see how they liked it. Once the test began, 94% of rats chose the sugar-sweetened water. Interestingly, rats still preferred the sweetened water even when researchers gradually increased the cocaine dose. \n\nWhen comparing the brains of food addicts to cocaine addicts side by side, the similarities are undeniable. fMRI scans of the brains activity reveal A massive spike in dopamine upon initial craving - high levels of anticipation, but low levels of satisfaction on consumption. Basically, Food addicts want sugar more than they actually enjoy eating it.\n\nIf you enjoy our animations and want to see more, please support us on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool Every little bit helps! \n\nFor more interesting videos, please subscribe\nTo get the After Skool Graphic Novel check out our new website https://www.afterskool.net/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrb06DhdrFE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrb06DhdrFE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrb06DhdrFE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rrb06DhdrFE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":137,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rrb06DhdrFE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ul5zMJnH8sbjcaShBce64Xm_MlQ","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLl83VTVKVmtfeTdV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-04T18:01:53Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"You Have NO Choice - George Carlin","description":"George Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and social critic.

Go check out the trailer for the doc here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou6HSQjaUj0&feature=youtu.be\n\nCheck out the After Skool graphic novel at https://www.afterskool.net/\n\nPlease support us on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/AfterSkool\n\nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite and as a parasite, its goal is to reproduce and affect more and more hosts. The only place in the entire world that toxoplasma can find a mate and sexually reproduce is in the gut of a felide....like a tiger, a lion,….or more commonly, a cat.  Inside the cat’s gut, the organism can recombine with other toxoplasma genes, sexually reproduce and create eggs, called oocysts. When a cat is infected, it sheds these eggs into the environment through its feces.\n\nThe eggs are highly durable and can sit in the environment for months or even years. Since the parasite can only reproduce in the gut of a cat, it’s evolutionary challenge is how to get back inside a cat. How does toxoplasma do this? It is very, very creative.\n\nThese toxoplasma eggs are everywhere, On the ground, in the water, basically around areas where there are cats. Cat prey, such as rodents, then root around through the soil or drink water that is contaminated with the parasite eggs. Once ingested, the parasite migrates throughout the rodent’s body, particularly the brain. \n\nAnd this is where it gets even crazier. Toxoplasma has the ability to rewire the brain and turn FEAR into DESIRE. The parasite forms cysts, focusing most densely on the amygdala, the region of the brain linked to fear and anxiety. So rodents, who’s instinctual behavior is to avoid the scent of cats aka avoid being eaten, now become sexually attracted to the smell of cat urine. The rodents are then more likely eaten by a cat, allowing the parasite to enter the next phase of its life cycle.\n\nBut the parasite is not only limited to rodents. 30-50% of humans carry toxoplasma. Once considered strictly latent in the human body, scientists are beginning to question that.\n\nFor more interesting videos, please subscribe!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aA-POO8S01Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aA-POO8S01Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aA-POO8S01Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aA-POO8S01Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":141,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"aA-POO8S01Y"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2niw-01gr7cXIjhKSyx9CXiYFOQ","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLngzcGtKV2d6NmNN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-17T15:27:28Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"Can A Human Be Frozen & Brought Back To Life? - Cryonics","description":"Check out our Graphic Novel at https://www.afterskool.net/\nPeople have been freezing themselves since the 1960's through cryonics.

The more scientific discoveries we make, the more questions arise. We will always debate where we came from or what came first. Perhaps the answers lie right before our feet? There are signs all around us that demonstrate how everything in the natural universe is connected...through geometry! No matter where you are in the universe, the principles of geometry and the language of math remain consistent. 2+2=4 no matter what planet you're on. So using these principles we can trace the pattern of creation. The similarities throughout nature are not a coincidence. This video gives a very quick overview of the pattern of creation, starting with a dot, then a circle, then Seed Of Life, Flower Of Life, Fruit Of Life and finally Metatron's Cube, which contains all the shapes that form the fabric of reality...Seriously! This stuff is mind blowing! There is a lot to talk about on this subject. Try not to get hung up on any one image, but rather step back and see the connections. Then walk around outside and observe the connections for yourself. They are everywhere! Also, it's very powerful to draw the Flower Of Life yourself.

The thought is that taking money from the wealthiest people will somehow balance things out. Unfortunately, this theory has backfired, because the rich use their financial knowledge to evade taxes through corporations. The good news is you too can use the same tricks that the rich use to LEGALLY evade taxes and make YOUR money work for YOU. All the information in this video was taken from a chapter in the book, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki.

With the internet today, we are flooded with so much information that we can’t possibly follow it all. There’s simply too much for our senses to handle. So the short answer is YES, ignorance is bliss.\n\nNow, there is a focus for your life and if you want a sense of purpose, you will have to develop a skill or an expertise in something. This is where being ignorant will not serve you. Imagine if Steph Curry stayed ignorant to basketball? Or Conor McGregor refused to learn every single aspect of MMA? (Do you think Conor is a good example here? Tell us your thoughts in the comments) \n\nWhen developing a skill there are 4 stages. Unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence and unconscious competence. These are the 4 steps to becoming a master at something.\n\nFor more interesting animations, please subscribe!\n\nAnimation by KramGallery.com\n\nVideo clip about \"practice\" was Allen Iverson at an NBA Press Conference in 2015.

The body burns fat 3x faster than steady cardio, while building muscle at the same time. Weight lifting alone does little to burn fat, and steady cardio, like jogging, does little to build muscle. During HIIT, The back and forth of explosive activity to rest causes muscle confusion and the body responds by growing muscle rapidly. At the same time the heart rate will skyrocket, burning glucose and giving you an excellent cardio session in a very short period of time.  What’s probably most fascinating about HIIT is what happens after the workout is over. HIIT creates a strong excess post-oxygen consumption effect, where the body continues to consume oxygen after the workout in order to recover the muscles back to their preworkout state. So the body revs up the metabolism and keeps burning calories and fat during recovery and this effect can last up to 24 hours after the workout is done.\n\nHIIT workouts can be done anywhere at anytime. There is no equipment or membership needed and most workouts are less than 30 minutes. \n\nFor more interesting videos please subscribe.

Porn desensitizes you to sex. The more porn you watch, the more it will take to get aroused and your brain will become numb to sexual images. The signals of arousal from your brain to your penis get weaker and weaker and like any addict it will take more stimulants to get the same effect each time until you hit the point of complete erectile dysfunction. ED rates have gone up during the last two or three decades, especially among younger guys. According to a study from the Journal of Sexual Medicine, one out of every four new ED patients is under 40 years old. Thankfully, it’s a problem that has a simple solution, BUT you must fully commit to quitting porn forever. This change will have a beneficial impact on every aspect of your life. \n\nHopefully this advice helps some of you out. We're clearly not saying porn or masturbation is immoral or anything. The point of this video is to help YOU lead a healthy successful life. \n\nThanks a ton to Brandon at One Percent Better for the collaboration on this animation.

As clean drinking water becomes more scarce, you maybe wondering…What happens if I drink seawater?\n \nLet’s first examine how our bodies absorb water. You may remember the process of Osmosis where water moves from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution, through a semi permeable membrane. The cell’s membrane allows water to pass through, but not the particles dissolved in water, like salt. Normally the saltiness of water inside our cells is the same as the saltiness outside our cells. When you drink water, a concentration difference takes place. Water from the outside your cell moves inside to maintain balance. This is called an isotonic state.\n\nWhen you drink too much seawater, the saltiness outside your cells will increase rapidly and the cells force water molecules out in order to restore balance. So even if you are already dehydrated, drinking sea water will cause your cells to release more water and you will end up peeing out more liquid than you take in.\n \nConversely if you chug a massive amount of pure water, the exact opposite will happen. The saltiness outside your cells will decrease rapidly and water will be forced into your cells. This can cause the cells to swell and burst, which in extreme cases leads to seizures, coma and sometimes death! This would only occur if you were to chug 6 liters or more in an instant though.\n \n \nSo what can you do if you are stranded on a deserted island with absolutely NO fresh water around? The simplest way to extract fresh clean water from the ocean is through distillation, which separates the salt from the water.  In order to distill water you must heat the sea water so it evaporates, then trap the evaporated water vapor until it cools and condenses back into liquid water. Kinda like the moisture on your bathroom mirror after a hot shower. This condensed water will be free of all salt and 100% safe to drink. \n\nAnd be sure to subscribe :)\n\nVideo by https://www.kramgallery.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu6A-eZ05fE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu6A-eZ05fE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu6A-eZ05fE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu6A-eZ05fE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nu6A-eZ05fE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":169,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Nu6A-eZ05fE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"knMo4jTdyrNAUjXT0filrwqy0u0","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLmxSOFlyUTkzcVpz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-15T15:01:56Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"Finding Growth Through Struggle - Guided Meditation (10 min)","description":"Close you eyes, get comfortable, breathe in deep and fill your body, exhale fully.

This phenomenon is called Intuition. We've all felt it, whether aware or not, but it's constantly working in the background of our minds. Intuition is the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. In this video, Daniel Cordaro Ph.D., explains the science behind our intuition, where is comes from, why we have it and how we can use it to our benefit. \n\nFor more weekly videos, Please Subscribe!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzRvKXiKbuw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzRvKXiKbuw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzRvKXiKbuw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzRvKXiKbuw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzRvKXiKbuw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":174,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"UzRvKXiKbuw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"pF9E23wWEutalwIbDezI-RS7sUw","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLlFYV05DaG9JbHVv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-01-05T18:59:39Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"Millennials in the Workforce, A Generation of Weakness - Simon Sinek","description":"Simon Sinek explains how the millennial generation became so entitled.

Extrinsic, focuses on money/material wealth, image and status. Happiness derived from these external sources result in a short-lived dopamine spurt and a never-ending state of wanting more. Intrinsic happiness on the other hand is derived from following a passion, personal growth, making the world a better place or loving relationships with family and friends. These are things that money can’t buy, and result in a long lasting joy from within.\n\nFor more interesting weekly videos PLEASE SUBSCRIBE :)\n\nAnimation by http://www.kramgallery.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0slPLpCYFM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0slPLpCYFM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0slPLpCYFM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0slPLpCYFM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0slPLpCYFM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"After Skool","playlistId":"UU1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","position":176,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"D0slPLpCYFM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"After Skool","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"VvxEAamZyGFm0gwy9uomesMJwp8","id":"VVUxS21OS1lDMWwwc3RqY3RrR3N3bDZnLlpkYnhLcXdPUV9n","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-11-06T20:58:58Z","channelId":"UC1KmNKYC1l0stjctkGswl6g","title":"Mass Extinction Crisis TODAY","description":"There have been 6 massive extinctions in our planet’s history. The first, happened 440 million years ago when an Extreme temperature drops froze the oceans and killed 86% of early life on earth. \n\nOver the next 66 million years, the seas repopulated, but an enormous algae bloom sucked up all the oxygen in the ocean and suffocated over half of all aquatic life.\n\n124 million years later, volcanic gases destroyed the ozone and caused the most devastating extinction in our planet’s existence.\n\nOnly 50 million years later, a giant volcanic rift split the earth, creating the Atlantic Ocean, but in doing so released a lethal wave of Carbon Dioxide, killing 80% of life. \n\nEvolution had the next 135 million years transform small amphibious creatures into the biggest reptiles to ever roam our planet. However, An asteroid the size of a small city crashed into present-day Mexico rapidly wiping out nearly ALL the dinosaurs.\n\n65 million years later humans have taken over as the dominant species. Our ability to use tools has given rise to an industrial revolution and control over practically every natural environment. With agriculture and modern medicine, the human population has exploded from 1 billion in 1900 to 7.5 billion in 2016. \n\nIt is because of our dominance and overconsumption that the 6th mass extinction is happening as we speak. Species today are dying out 1000x faster than before humans existed. There is now more plastic in the ocean than fish! Approximately 15 billion trees are chopped down each year and Carbon Dioxide levels have increased 25% in the last 50 years.\n\n\nIf we continue our destructive trend, Scientists predict half of all living species could be extinct in the next 100 years. \n\nSo what can YOU do?\n\nCompost, recycle, start an edible garden, eat less meat, walk or bike instead of drive and do everything you can to reduce your footprint on this planet. We now know that it's going to take MORE than driving a Prius or changing your lightbulb to SAVE OUR PLANET. Every one of us is part of this world, and so what we do--or don’t do--has an impact on the world around us. We got ourselves into this mess, and now it is up to us to solve our way out.\n\nFor more interesting weekly videos PLEASE SUBSCRIBE :)\n\nanimation by http://www.kramgallery.com/\n\nAfter Skool is a self funded non profit.
