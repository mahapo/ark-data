a"},{"startMs":812480,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"santa claus machine where you take"},{"startMs":816160,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"uh you take material in space and

those"},{"startMs":923199,"durationMs":5121,"subtitle":"elements and to perform modern alchemy"},{"startMs":926639,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"is what it sounds like"},{"startMs":928320,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"but also when you talk about the water"},{"startMs":930959,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"and how much"},{"startMs":932320,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"you have to to mine to extract just a"},{"startMs":935440,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"few ounces"},{"startMs":936880,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"would it be better to actually extract"},{"startMs":938880,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"it from

i"},{"startMs":961199,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"get two gallons a day"},{"startMs":962560,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"out of my living room so could you get"},{"startMs":965600,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"that's awesome dude that's freaking"},{"startMs":967519,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"amazing so could you do something like"},{"startMs":969120,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"that in the moon's atmosphere i mean"},{"startMs":970480,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"it's got a little bit of an

but"},{"startMs":982880,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"really though i mean it's pretty cool"},{"startMs":984079,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"that you could pick up 12 ounces out of"},{"startMs":985680,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that amount of"},{"startMs":986639,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"oh yeah but the question is make a big"},{"startMs":989440,"durationMs":2399,"subtitle":"difference really could be a game"},{"startMs":990720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"changer a big one"},{"startMs":991839,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"would it though yeah it could be see"},{"startMs":994320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"right now we're looking at
