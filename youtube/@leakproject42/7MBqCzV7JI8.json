is"},{"startMs":1814080,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"i installed a horizontal garage"},{"startMs":1816799,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"and uh it works like a charm and i"},{"startMs":1819760,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"figured out a way to run it from here in"},{"startMs":1821440,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"connecticut and it's 2500 miles away"},{"startMs":1824240,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1825279,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"and so this is the system in the"},{"startMs":1827679,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"building with the roof off"},{"startMs":1829520,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"you'll notice the camera the red

that"},{"startMs":1839360,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"well i do that because the light comes"},{"startMs":1840799,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"in goes down here hits the main mirror"},{"startMs":1842640,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"comes up and normally hits another"},{"startMs":1844480,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"mirror that's supposed to be here

done"},{"startMs":1854640,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"is the light comes in hits that main"},{"startMs":1856799,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"mirror comes up and this object

tucson"},{"startMs":1863840,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"great people"},{"startMs":1865200,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"and it goes to the camera directly so"},{"startMs":1866880,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"this is a lens system that then takes"},{"startMs":1868559,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"the light and brings it to the camera"},{"startMs":1870799,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"this takes the telescope and makes it a"},{"startMs":1873200,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"very fast system"},{"startMs":1875600,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"all right the 25 times faster i was"},{"startMs":1877679,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"telling you about"},{"startMs":1878960,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"and um"},{"startMs":1880640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"i had to write a program to control
