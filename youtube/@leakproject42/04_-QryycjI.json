basically"},{"startMs":447520,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"takes a it's it's a type of fusion but"},{"startMs":450400,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"uh it it takes because the

uh"},{"startMs":508960,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"in the radiation one of course i"},{"startMs":510639,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"mentioned they had one where they

10"},{"startMs":822240,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"c60 and then you've got to separate the"},{"startMs":824399,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"c60 well with sublimation if you"},{"startMs":826320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"remember from your high school"},{"startMs":827760,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"chemistry class is like evaporation

then"},{"startMs":844399,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"to a solid sublimation just cuts out the"},{"startMs":846560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"liquid stage and so we actually take the"},{"startMs":848480,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"ashes put them in a sublimator heat it"},{"startMs":850320,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"up to about 400 degrees celsius and

but"},{"startMs":1256080,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"c60 is passes the gut barrier and passes"},{"startMs":1258799,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"the blood brain barrier so it gets"},{"startMs":1260159,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"everywhere in your body and and then it"},{"startMs":1262159,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"especially is taken up by

they"},{"startMs":1434320,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"can penetrate into things right and"},{"startMs":1436159,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"cause it well they said well how
