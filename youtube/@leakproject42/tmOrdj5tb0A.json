a"},{"startMs":311740,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"document in 1964 in January the"},{"startMs":314830,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"department of information which is

it"},{"startMs":323260,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"it sent out a paper that if they were"},{"startMs":325360,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"looking at five film directors and"},{"startMs":327970,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"doesn't say why or anything like that"},{"startMs":329740,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"but they were five or the biggest

he"},{"startMs":345850,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"was a young guy and his name was Stanley"},{"startMs":348310,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"Kubrick now I don't know why the"},{"startMs":349990,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"Department of Information was looking"},{"startMs":351760,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"for film directors but I do know that"},{"startMs":354520,"durationMs":6270,"subtitle":"NASA the Apollo program started at"},{"startMs":357820,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"exactly about this same time period okay"},{"startMs":360790,"durationMs":10500,"subtitle":"so what happened is is that in order to"},{"startMs":366700,"durationMs":7830,"subtitle":"ensure that the Apollo landings looked"},{"startMs":371290,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"good they decided to fake the moon"},{"startMs":374530,"durationMs":6870,"subtitle":"landings now it's very dubious idea that"},{"startMs":378790,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"you can shoot movies or photos on the"},{"startMs":381400,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"surface of the Moon it's got

the"},{"startMs":402230,"durationMs":5610,"subtitle":"airport detector right so you had to"},{"startMs":406400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"take the film out before you put the"},{"startMs":407840,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"thing through nowadays digital doesn't"},{"startMs":410000,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"matter but in those days it did and so"},{"startMs":412880,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"the whole idea of taking film on the"},{"startMs":415280,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"moon it's just super dubious so whether"},{"startMs":418190,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"they went to the moon or not I'm not"},{"startMs":419750,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"saying I'm just saying that what we saw"},{"startMs":421730,"durationMs":7070,"subtitle":"and were shown was faked in a studio and"},{"startMs":425410,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"furthermore it was faked using a"},{"startMs":428800,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"technique called frontscreen projection"},{"startMs":431140,"durationMs":8020,"subtitle":"and just so happens that the leading"},{"startMs":435560,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"film director on earth at the time who"},{"startMs":439160,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"understood frontscreen projection was"},{"startMs":441560,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"none other than Stan Curie"},{"startMs":443570,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"so the eight scenes at the beginning of"},{"startMs":445580,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"2001 were filmed in front screen"},{"startMs":447860,"durationMs":3510,"subtitle":"projection they were not on a desert"},{"startMs":449240,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"somewhere that was filmed in a studio"},{"startMs":451370,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"but you can't tell and he became the"},{"startMs":455210,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"master and so my thesis is that Kubrick"},{"startMs":458570,"durationMs":7050,"subtitle":"used the making of 2001 a Space Odyssey"},{"startMs":461450,"durationMs":9780,"subtitle":"as a cover for doing the Apollo footage"},{"startMs":465620,"durationMs":7470,"subtitle":"and he was chosen because he was the"},{"startMs":471230,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"most technical of film makers at the"},{"startMs":473090,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"time the other four filmmakers that I'm"},{"startMs":475910,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"talking about we're not technical"},{"startMs":477890,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"filmmakers they came from the stage"},{"startMs":479330,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"world right and then they put the stage"},{"startMs":483080,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"techniques from theatre into filmmaking"},{"startMs":485750,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"which you know it's fine but Kubrick"},{"startMs":487640,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"came from photography and documentary"},{"startMs":490850,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"films in which he shot the films he"},{"startMs":493460,"durationMs":2970,"subtitle":"lifts the film's he edited

guy"},{"startMs":498110,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"doing everything and he learned"},{"startMs":499910,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"everything by doing that and so by the"},{"startMs":501920,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"time that he got to Hollywood are doing"},{"startMs":504800,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"the Apollo film he knew every every"},{"startMs":507320,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"technique every trick in the book and he"},{"startMs":510170,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"knew that there were things that were"},{"startMs":511850,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"gonna be big problems like how how what"},{"startMs":514940,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"how are the astronauts gonna leap high"},{"startMs":516850,"durationMs":4330,"subtitle":"right cuz you're shooting it on earth"},{"startMs":519020,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"and how can they do that and you know he"},{"startMs":521180,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"used wires and the trampoline in one"},{"startMs":523520,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"shot everything very carefully done and"},{"startMs":526580,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"hit if you know filmmaking like I do"},{"startMs":528290,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"I've spent my whole life making films I"},{"startMs":530660,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"mean you just know you can look and"},{"startMs":532130,"durationMs":6270,"subtitle":"see and so what happened to me was I was"},{"startMs":535040,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"working with Richard Hoagland on his"},{"startMs":538400,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"stuff on the moon back in the early 90s"},{"startMs":541160,"durationMs":7950,"subtitle":"and I began going to NASA all the"},{"startMs":544940,"durationMs":6750,"subtitle":"archival places Houston and Maryland

were"},{"startMs":557780,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"looking at was real but as I was going"},{"startMs":559850,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"through the archives I kept like"},{"startMs":561200,"durationMs":3950,"subtitle":"scratching my head and going there's"},{"startMs":563030,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"something wrong with these photos"},{"startMs":565150,"durationMs":3790,"subtitle":"everything is in focus for one thing how"},{"startMs":568250,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"can that be"},{"startMs":568940,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"the astronauts I've got the camera like"},{"startMs":571700,"durationMs":3030,"subtitle":"here they can't really look into the"},{"startMs":573410,"durationMs":3890,"subtitle":"viewfinder so they're just randomly"},{"startMs":574730,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"clicking is what we're being told and"},{"startMs":577300,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"yet they were composed actually pretty"},{"startMs":580070,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"well and there was lighting techniques"},{"startMs":583400,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"being used I can show you many examples"},{"startMs":585230,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"and it's like sometimes Stanley just"},{"startMs":587870,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"couldn't help himself one of the other"},{"startMs":591110,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"pieces of evidence besides that he was"},{"startMs":593630,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"using 2001 as his template go ahead when"},{"startMs":596300,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"you say Stanley couldn't help

wanted"},{"startMs":640520,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"to get everyone to know this and that"},{"startMs":642740,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"all right so that's the first part so I"},{"startMs":645650,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"want to get back to that but there was"},{"startMs":647630,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"another part that has to be said because"},{"startMs":649550,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"it's actually the evidence that I'm"},{"startMs":651500,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"right and that is his movie The
