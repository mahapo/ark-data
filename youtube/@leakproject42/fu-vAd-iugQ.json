10 years further into the"},{"startMs":1060919,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"future"},{"startMs":1062720,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"and see what the difference was

to"},{"startMs":1100400,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"get an answer"},{"startMs":1102080,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"but in any case in 2018 I started doing"},{"startMs":1104900,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"that"},{"startMs":1106120,"durationMs":7559,"subtitle":"and uh about a thousand people"},{"startMs":1108940,"durationMs":4739,"subtitle":"participated again all over the world"},{"startMs":1113780,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and um"},{"startMs":1115880,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"what they describe is very consistent"},{"startMs":1118580,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"with the 2050s"},{"startMs":1121700,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"but there are some new insights so there"},{"startMs":1124520,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"are things which apparently happened"},{"startMs":1127520,"durationMs":6899,"subtitle":"which the 2050s it didn't seem as big a"},{"startMs":1130760,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"deal when I was doing the 2050 part"},{"startMs":1134419,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"uh the big one which I I'm only"},{"startMs":1137660,"durationMs":7139,"subtitle":"beginning to understand"},{"startMs":1140240,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"was that between 2040 and 2045 there are"},{"startMs":1144799,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"a series of things that occur

the"},{"startMs":1166460,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"other side of it now now what I think"},{"startMs":1169520,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"is going to happen"},{"startMs":1171559,"durationMs":4821,"subtitle":"well several things one is climate"},{"startMs":1174440,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"change of

they"},{"startMs":1183080,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"described climate change and I didn't"},{"startMs":1185179,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"know what to make of it I just didn't"},{"startMs":1187760,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"and nobody I knew could make anything"},{"startMs":1189860,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"out of it the first paper scientific"},{"startMs":1193160,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"paper that I saw that addressed what we"},{"startMs":1197000,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"now would call climate climate change"},{"startMs":1198919,"durationMs":5941,"subtitle":"that isn't what they called it but"},{"startMs":1201620,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"it was in 1991 and a paper published

get all these"},{"startMs":1211580,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"comments about what I now see is climate"},{"startMs":1214400,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"change people would talk about you

and"},{"startMs":1221299,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"people would say to me things like oh"},{"startMs":1223100,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"well part of the city is under water"},{"startMs":1225799,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"and I would think under what or why"},{"startMs":1228200,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"would it be underwater and I went to"},{"startMs":1230720,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"friends who were climatologists and said"},{"startMs":1233299,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"can you tell me why large parts of

science"},{"startMs":1243980,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"fiction"},{"startMs":1245419,"durationMs":4741,"subtitle":"but of course we now know that that's"},{"startMs":1247580,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"going to happen so part of it is climate"},{"startMs":1250160,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"change part of it is the end of
