was"},{"startMs":53760,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"just for a while there people were just"},{"startMs":55440,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"they were they were buying a bunch they"},{"startMs":57120,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"probably just bought a bunch until they"},{"startMs":58480,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"figured out how to make it themselves"},{"startMs":60160,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and uh and so now they don't need to buy"},{"startMs":63039,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"it"},{"startMs":63600,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"that's usually how it goes that makes"},{"startMs":65920,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"sense they wanted to"},{"startMs":66960,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"to figure it out once they got the"},{"startMs":68799,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"formula then they started their

there"},{"startMs":74240,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"were a lot of"},{"startMs":74960,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"tests done on uh"},{"startMs":78159,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"lab rats

were"},{"startMs":83520,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"seeing how much they could handle"},{"startMs":85680,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"as far as toxicity and it ended up being"},{"startMs":88720,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"completely opposite of what they"},{"startMs":90479,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"expected right"},{"startMs":92560,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"well the first yeah the first time when"},{"startMs":94240,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"they did it they just they figured oh"},{"startMs":95520,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"it's a new molecule"},{"startMs":96880,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"and so uh let's test it for toxicity and"},{"startMs":100479,"durationMs":2161,"subtitle":"instead of being toxic it actually"},{"startMs":102079,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"doubled"},{"startMs":102640,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"the animal's lifespan so"},{"startMs":105759,"durationMs":6881,"subtitle":"which was which was a surprising result"},{"startMs":109600,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"that is a surprising result and the the"},{"startMs":112640,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"information like how much were they"},{"startMs":114720,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"were they giving them oh they were"},{"startMs":118240,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"uh they were probably giving them you"},{"startMs":119680,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"know maybe 40"},{"startMs":121439,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"50 times what you know a person might be"},{"startMs":123200,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"taking wow"},{"startMs":125040,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"so they were filling them up"},{"startMs":128399,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"yeah well the rats weren't too happy"},{"startMs":129840,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"about it they kissed you know they it's"},{"startMs":131440,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"you have to dissolve c-16 oil they were"},{"startMs":133599,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"using olive oil so they were just kind"},{"startMs":135599,"durationMs":4881,"subtitle":"of like taking syringes and"},{"startMs":137360,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"stuffing it down their throats so uh"},{"startMs":140480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"it wasn't happy rats but they've they've"},{"startMs":142239,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"taken it to the next level"},{"startMs":144000,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"on that and they've actually given rats"},{"startMs":145840,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"you know one usually what for"},{"startMs":147760,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"they found that you know effective doses"},{"startMs":149599,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"or something like 0.1 milligrams per"},{"startMs":151840,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"kilogram"},{"startMs":152720,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"which is pretty low and they gave them"},{"startMs":155440,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"up to a"},{"startMs":156000,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"gram per kilogram so that's like 10 000"},{"startMs":158720,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"times"},{"startMs":159760,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"what uh what a person would normally be"},{"startMs":162239,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"taking with c60"},{"startMs":163760,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and there was no toxic effects now if"},{"startMs":166959,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"you did the same thing with some other"},{"startMs":168560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"antioxidant like vitamin e"},{"startMs":170000,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"or vitamin d that would have definitely"},{"startMs":172000,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"killed them"},{"startMs":173680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"the rats would have just keeled over and"},{"startMs":174959,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"died but one of the things about c60"},{"startMs":177360,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"it's a selective antioxidant"},{"startMs":179040,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"that means it only interacts with high"},{"startMs":180800,"durationMs":2719,"subtitle":"energy oxidative radicals like super"},{"startMs":182640,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"oxygen"},{"startMs":183519,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radical maybe"},{"startMs":186800,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"peroxy nitrate"},{"startMs":188080,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"and it doesn't react with a lot of lower"},{"startMs":189840,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"energy oxidative radicals like the"},{"startMs":191200,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"nitrogen oxide family"},{"startMs":193040,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and there's other ones based on zinc"},{"startMs":196239,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"iron and sulfur and those are actually"},{"startMs":198400,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"used by the body as signaling molecules"},{"startMs":200319,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"you need a little bit of"},{"startMs":201519,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"oxidative radicals and a little bit of"},{"startMs":203360,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"you know antioxidants and it kind of"},{"startMs":205280,"durationMs":2319,"subtitle":"balances out but that's at the lower"},{"startMs":206799,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"level"},{"startMs":207599,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and that's why vitamin d and vitamin e"},{"startMs":209840,"durationMs":2319,"subtitle":"and sometimes if you take you know"},{"startMs":211519,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"coquette"},{"startMs":212159,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"it'll mess with the lower level"},{"startMs":214319,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"signaling molecules and that'll cause"},{"startMs":215920,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"problems"},{"startMs":216879,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"but since c60 it's it doesn't interact"},{"startMs":219200,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"with low energy molecules"},{"startMs":220959,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"it only acts with the really high energy"},{"startMs":222560,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"ones it has no toxicity whatever"},{"startMs":224840,"durationMs":6119,"subtitle":"whatsoever"},{"startMs":227360,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"now the c60 process that you use you use"},{"startMs":230959,"durationMs":6161,"subtitle":"like uh isn't it 99.9"},{"startMs":233840,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"percent c60"},{"startMs":237120,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"yeah we use yeah 99.9 percent sublimated"},{"startMs":240000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"c60"},{"startMs":241200,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"subtle beta is just evaporation you uh"},{"startMs":244400,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it's the same as evaporation just turns"},{"startMs":245920,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"a solid turns into gas you put in the"},{"startMs":247360,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"sublimator on one side it's like all the"},{"startMs":249200,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"ashes you know maybe 10"},{"startMs":251040,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"c60 the rest is just you know ashes and"},{"startMs":253040,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"then you heat it up to like 400 degrees"},{"startMs":255120,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"celsius"},{"startMs":256000,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"it turns into a gas and it floats to the"},{"startMs":257840,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"other side of the sublimator"},{"startMs":259359,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"which is cooler and it condenses on some"},{"startMs":261280,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"plates over there"},{"startMs":262400,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"and then you just scrape it off and"},{"startMs":263600,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"you've got 99.99"},{"startMs":265759,"durationMs":6961,"subtitle":"pure c60 no solvents involved"},{"startMs":270000,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"so for somebody that's new to c60 uh"},{"startMs":272720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"it's"},{"startMs":273360,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"pure carbon carbon 60. there's been a"},{"startMs":276400,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"lot of stuff on the internet even today"},{"startMs":278320,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"i"},{"startMs":278560,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"looked in the comment section and"},{"startMs":279600,"durationMs":2159,"subtitle":"somebody was still going off about how"},{"startMs":281280,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"they're"},{"startMs":281759,"durationMs":4121,"subtitle":"nanobots and how they're you know they"},{"startMs":283840,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"can they can take over your mind with"},{"startMs":285880,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"nanotechnology and the carbon it uses 5g"},{"startMs":288960,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"and i'm just like where did this come up"},{"startMs":292000,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"like how did they even come up with this"},{"startMs":293440,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"idea"},{"startMs":294320,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"it's carbon you see the background yeah"},{"startMs":296960,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"you see the background that's a c60"},{"startMs":298639,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"molecule back there what it's looking"},{"startMs":300000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"like it's basically a carbon atom"},{"startMs":302080,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"with 60 carbon atoms shaped like a mini"},{"startMs":304400,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"soccer ball"},{"startMs":305759,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"and uh the whole belief that c60 is you"},{"startMs":308720,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"know"},{"startMs":309360,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"a plot by ai nano butts to take over"},{"startMs":313199,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"our minds is completely ridiculous you"},{"startMs":315600,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"know c60 is one of the strongest"},{"startMs":317360,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"molecules in nature it's it's an"},{"startMs":319759,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"allotrope of carbon it's like a cousin"},{"startMs":322080,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"of uh diamond and so it's extremely hard"},{"startMs":325600,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"and there isn't any enzymes"},{"startMs":327440,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"or anything in your body that can break"},{"startMs":329199,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"down c60 it is impossible"},{"startMs":331759,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"it will not happen you know so it"},{"startMs":335039,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"it'll oxidize at about 500 degrees"},{"startMs":337039,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"celsius but if your body was"},{"startMs":338800,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"subject to that poof you'd be gone right"},{"startMs":341360,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"so c60 is virtually indestructible"},{"startMs":343280,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"and it doesn't make any permanent"},{"startMs":344479,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"chemical bonds in the body so it just"},{"startMs":345840,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"kind of washes out"},{"startMs":347039,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"it's like the first cousin of a diamond"},{"startMs":349680,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":350160,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"so it's not really very reactive it only"},{"startMs":352639,"durationMs":4881,"subtitle":"reacts with like super high energy"},{"startMs":354560,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"oxidative radicals and uh that's the"},{"startMs":357520,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"reason that"},{"startMs":358479,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"it has no toxicity"},{"startMs":361680,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"it's just the unknown essentially people"},{"startMs":364240,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"aren't really aware they read something"},{"startMs":366160,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and then they they think they've got the"},{"startMs":367759,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"answer and they think that it's nanobots"},{"startMs":369360,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you know it's interesting because today"},{"startMs":370479,"durationMs":5601,"subtitle":"i literally did do a podcast"},{"startMs":372560,"durationMs":7359,"subtitle":"on a new technology that allows"},{"startMs":376080,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"scientists to print up these wafers that"},{"startMs":379919,"durationMs":5681,"subtitle":"turn into approximately a million

functions"},{"startMs":409840,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"and i i don't know how advanced these"},{"startMs":411599,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"things are but that technology that's"},{"startMs":413919,"durationMs":5601,"subtitle":"what a nanobot is this is"},{"startMs":415680,"durationMs":5919,"subtitle":"a molecule this is carbon 60."},{"startMs":419520,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"yeah it's it's it's perfectly spherical"},{"startMs":421599,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"it's a cousin of

you"},{"startMs":433120,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"know carbon 60's been around"},{"startMs":435360,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"for billions of years right when the"},{"startMs":438319,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"carbon 60 started with the first carbon"},{"startMs":440240,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"burning stars when stars started

molecule"},{"startMs":450240,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and uh and it was actually there was"},{"startMs":451919,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"this thing called diffuse interstellar"},{"startMs":454080,"durationMs":2559,"subtitle":"bands"},{"startMs":454960,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"and so they were they're they're in the"},{"startMs":456639,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"infrared band and they were really wide"},{"startMs":458639,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"so they knew it had to be a

back"},{"startMs":716959,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"into the story"},{"startMs":718079,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"uh i read about c60 so i started taking"},{"startMs":720399,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"c60 before you know"},{"startMs":722160,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"the thing because they gave one set

a"},{"startMs":733839,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"couple of them"},{"startMs":734959,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"died and so you know it was like almost"},{"startMs":737279,"durationMs":4881,"subtitle":"perfect protection against radiation"},{"startMs":739440,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"for the rats and so uh depending they"},{"startMs":742160,"durationMs":1919,"subtitle":"even went down"},{"startMs":742880,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"when they hit them like four or five"},{"startMs":744079,"durationMs":2161,"subtitle":"times fatal dose of radiation at that"},{"startMs":745760,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"point"},{"startMs":746240,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"a couple of the rats died but you know"},{"startMs":748240,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"that's uh"},{"startMs":749360,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"that but all the control rats were just"},{"startMs":751120,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"gone like that so c60 is like a super"},{"startMs":753360,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"radiation protectant"},{"startMs":754880,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"and that's why i started taking it and"},{"startMs":757360,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"my crew was taking it too"},{"startMs":758639,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"and then about seven months after i had"},{"startMs":760560,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"been you know i kept"},{"startMs":762000,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"after the project was over right it was"},{"startMs":763680,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"successful we just i just kept taking it"},{"startMs":765680,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"on and off and then i went to my eye"},{"startMs":767200,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"doctor and my macular degeneration to"},{"startMs":769279,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"disappear"},{"startMs":770320,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"which was pretty surprising because he'd"},{"startMs":772240,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"never seen that in as many decades of"},{"startMs":773920,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"service and so"},{"startMs":775200,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"of uh being an optometrist so then i"},{"startMs":778160,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"gave it to my friend gary"},{"startMs":779600,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"he was our electrical engineer and he"},{"startMs":780959,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"had developed by that time uh"},{"startMs":783040,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"severe wet macular degeneration we had"},{"startMs":785600,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"this uh we have a show"},{"startMs":786880,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the c6 c60 purple power on youtube and"},{"startMs":789680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"we have one of the shows his eyes on c60"},{"startMs":791680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and you can see his before and after"},{"startMs":793360,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"pictures on the inside of his

eyeballs"},{"startMs":798639,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and he took c60 purple power"},{"startMs":801920,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"in in mct cocoa about a tablespoon a day"},{"startMs":804639,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"for a year"},{"startMs":805440,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and they completely healed up and he"},{"startMs":807519,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"generously allowed us to use his"},{"startMs":809440,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"before and after pictures so so that's"},{"startMs":811680,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"you know and that was very worried"},{"startMs":812720,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"because you know macular degeneration"},{"startMs":814240,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"causes blindness"},{"startMs":815519,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and i didn't want to go by no that's"},{"startMs":818560,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"huge"},{"startMs":819199,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"and so i like the like this right here"},{"startMs":821920,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"is the mct and the coconut oil"},{"startMs":824000,"durationMs":6639,"subtitle":"and i have been riding like a madman

has"},{"startMs":834880,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"approximately 3 800 feet elevation"},{"startMs":837279,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"and doing that round trip over

get"},{"startMs":842880,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"really intense until about the 8 mile"},{"startMs":844480,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"mark so about halfway in then it gets"},{"startMs":846000,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"intense"},{"startMs":846880,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"but um i've been you know right rode up"},{"startMs":848480,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"to canyon at the ancients the other day"},{"startMs":849839,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"i just ordered a dual

cross"},{"startMs":853600,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"country"},{"startMs":854399,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and and i've been drinking the c60 like"},{"startMs":856959,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"a madman also so"},{"startMs":858399,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"this is the mct and i noticed the mct is"},{"startMs":861519,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"almost like an"},{"startMs":862240,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"instant boost for me like the avocado i"},{"startMs":864720,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"love the avocado i'll take a shot of"},{"startMs":866160,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"that in the morning"},{"startMs":867040,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"but the mct i noticed something a little"},{"startMs":869360,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"bit different"},{"startMs":870639,"durationMs":5121,"subtitle":"and it seems to be like an extra boost"},{"startMs":872560,"durationMs":6639,"subtitle":"why is that i don't understand"},{"startMs":875760,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"it's the mct oil the coconut oil mct"},{"startMs":879199,"durationMs":2481,"subtitle":"means medium chain triglycerides but"},{"startMs":880959,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"what they really are"},{"startMs":881680,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"short chain triglycerides so they're"},{"startMs":883199,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"like you got like six chain eight chain"},{"startMs":885440,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"maybe 10 chain"},{"startMs":886959,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"carbon chains in there and your liver"},{"startMs":888800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"can take mct oil"},{"startMs":890480,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"and turn it into ketones which are like"},{"startMs":892800,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"which your cells can use as an

my"},{"startMs":908240,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"friend gary"},{"startMs":909040,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"he was taking the coconut oil because he"},{"startMs":910880,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"had developed type 2 diabetes"},{"startMs":912720,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"you know he was uh he has

2"},{"startMs":919600,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"diabetes went away as well"},{"startMs":920959,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"so so that's a really a wonderful thing"},{"startMs":923839,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"with"},{"startMs":924959,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"c60 can do but you know the thing is i'm"},{"startMs":927120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"going to do a bit the disclaimer here"},{"startMs":928639,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"you know c60 doesn't heal anything what"},{"startMs":930720,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"c60 does it lifts the oxidative burden"},{"startMs":933600,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"your cells are under so they can operate"},{"startMs":936160,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"the way"},{"startMs":936959,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"they were when you were much younger"},{"startMs":942240,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"how yeah because as we get older you"},{"startMs":945199,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"know a lot of the antioxidants because"},{"startMs":946800,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"you know"},{"startMs":947199,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"gary's in his 70s right i'm you know i'm"},{"startMs":949920,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"59"},{"startMs":950720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"kind of getting up there but as we get"},{"startMs":952800,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"older a lot of the antioxidants"},{"startMs":954160,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that our cells naturally produce just go"},{"startMs":956079,"durationMs":2401,"subtitle":"down along with a lot of things as you"},{"startMs":957920,"durationMs":2479,"subtitle":"age"},{"startMs":958480,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and so when you take c60 it replaces"},{"startMs":960399,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"those missing antioxidants so now your"},{"startMs":962800,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"cells are like"},{"startMs":963600,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"operating like you were 20 years younger"},{"startMs":966399,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and when you were 20 years younger"},{"startMs":968079,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"everything worked a whole lot better so"},{"startMs":970399,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":971279,"durationMs":6641,"subtitle":"so that's why c60 is such a great thing"},{"startMs":975120,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"okay and then that let's talk more about"},{"startMs":977920,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"that"},{"startMs":978320,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"mox fusion stuff that sounds like 21st"},{"startMs":981120,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"century alchemy"},{"startMs":983680,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"yeah it is it is basically a couple

things"},{"startMs":1070720,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"and they break into more things and"},{"startMs":1072320,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"that's so when you turn off the

it"},{"startMs":1104480,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"oh no it puts out x-rays basically"},{"startMs":1106480,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"that's what happened to those guys

energy"},{"startMs":1115440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"than x-rays and so what happened is"},{"startMs":1117600,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"because we found a way to lower the"},{"startMs":1120000,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"column barrier for fusion so it's when"},{"startMs":1123200,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"we make our daughter products they"},{"startMs":1124880,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"they would react and they would kick out"},{"startMs":1126880,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"an x-ray in regular fusion they kick

yeah"},{"startMs":1140240,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"they're lower frequency so see our"},{"startMs":1143520,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"moxie fusion's like a million times"},{"startMs":1145120,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"easier to do than regular fusion or more"},{"startMs":1146720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"than a million

fusion"},{"startMs":1152160,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"so so so that also means that the energy"},{"startMs":1155679,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"that comes out of it is that like"},{"startMs":1156960,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"instead of being gamma ray"},{"startMs":1158400,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"which you you basically take down into"},{"startMs":1160720,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"heat and then you use it to boil water"},{"startMs":1162880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"ours comes out in x-rays you take it"},{"startMs":1164559,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"down to heat and boil water"},{"startMs":1166640,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and so we just uh and we third-party"},{"startMs":1169679,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"already uh we third-party verified it"},{"startMs":1172320,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"with"},{"startMs":1172799,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"tsa security systems they make the

cool"},{"startMs":1179679,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"radioactive detectors so we took it down"},{"startMs":1181280,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"to their place and uh"},{"startMs":1182799,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and they turned the reactor on and they"},{"startMs":1184240,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"confirmed yep that's fusion for sure"},{"startMs":1187039,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"and we were fusing what we were doing is"},{"startMs":1188640,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"we're fusing we fuse

what"},{"startMs":1372880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"was happening the oxygen was fusing with"},{"startMs":1375200,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"the platinum and making

got"},{"startMs":1412159,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"i think she discovered radon or a couple"},{"startMs":1414240,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"of the other elements that they took

right"},{"startMs":1431360,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"they only open the vault once a year for"},{"startMs":1434000,"durationMs":2559,"subtitle":"researchers to come and read through

so"},{"startMs":1438520,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"radioactive"},{"startMs":1439919,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"and then they got to put them back in"},{"startMs":1441039,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"the vault and close it and that's all"},{"startMs":1442640,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"the radiation you can get exposed to for"},{"startMs":1444400,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"that year for that researcher"},{"startMs":1446159,"durationMs":5601,"subtitle":"so yeah oops"},{"startMs":1449440,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"maybe digitize that you're on your"},{"startMs":1451760,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"computer"},{"startMs":1453600,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"no we must read her notes directly from"},{"startMs":1456400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"the radioactive node paper"},{"startMs":1458559,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"now that's fascinating this is"},{"startMs":1460000,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"incredible so then what do you do"},{"startMs":1462559,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"that's different so it's safer for"},{"startMs":1465520,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"yourself i mean obviously you're"},{"startMs":1466720,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"drinking c60 every day and that's that's"},{"startMs":1468720,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"fantastic"},{"startMs":1469760,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"but what else are you doing well"},{"startMs":1472799,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"first off when we turn it on we go away"},{"startMs":1475600,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"you don't hang out near it because it's"},{"startMs":1477039,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"got x-rays right so we have like cameras"},{"startMs":1479120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and other stuff"},{"startMs":1479919,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"and so we just way over there and we get"},{"startMs":1482720,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"far away and we have radiation detectors"},{"startMs":1484640,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"like x-ray plates"},{"startMs":1486080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and other and other things it makes a"},{"startMs":1487919,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"whole series of fusion reactions but uh"},{"startMs":1490080,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"so we can actually measure the level"},{"startMs":1492000,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that's going on so we just basically"},{"startMs":1494159,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"when it goes on we get we get out of"},{"startMs":1496080,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"there and and we watch it remotely with"},{"startMs":1498320,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"cameras and stuff"},{"startMs":1499440,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and the sensors are there picking stuff"},{"startMs":1501120,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"up so we're not around anywhere

uh"},{"startMs":1712880,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"plain it's it's kind of it's"},{"startMs":1716080,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"they're about me because you

tunnel"},{"startMs":1748720,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"so which is pretty amazing tunneling is"},{"startMs":1751279,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"when you have like a barrier"},{"startMs":1752880,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"because everything is either is a wave"},{"startMs":1755039,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"and a particle"},{"startMs":1756320,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"so if you pound enough c60s up against"},{"startMs":1758480,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"like a you got a 10"},{"startMs":1760000,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"10 uh atom thick gold barrier"},{"startMs":1763120,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"and you bounce enough c60s up every

it's"},{"startMs":1781679,"durationMs":5681,"subtitle":"it'll tunnel through onto the other side"},{"startMs":1784320,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"and uh and uh then you have"},{"startMs":1787360,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"then there's a molecule pops up that's"},{"startMs":1788799,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"how you make quantum devices by the way"},{"startMs":1790880,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"is they use oxygen you put about maybe"},{"startMs":1792880,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"it's about 10"},{"startMs":1794080,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"gold atoms thick a sheet you got"},{"startMs":1796720,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"billions of

side"},{"startMs":1802159,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"and they're bouncing around and every"},{"startMs":1803440,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"now and then because oxygen molecules"},{"startMs":1804880,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"are two oxygens"},{"startMs":1806000,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"and every now and then one of those"},{"startMs":1807120,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"molecules will appear on the other side"},{"startMs":1809039,"durationMs":2081,"subtitle":"of the gold barrier it'll have tunneled"},{"startMs":1810480,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"through"},{"startMs":1811120,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"and then those two atoms are now in"},{"startMs":1814240,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"they're now quantumly linked so you take"},{"startMs":1816799,"durationMs":2401,"subtitle":"those two"},{"startMs":1817520,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"oxygen molecules apart you put them in"},{"startMs":1819200,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"like a little silicon

that's"},{"startMs":1883600,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"gonna be right after this one so"},{"startMs":1885600,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"um because this is so important i think"},{"startMs":1887600,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"we need to focus directly on on the c60"},{"startMs":1889760,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"then we'll move to that then we'll move"},{"startMs":1891039,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"to the the"},{"startMs":1892080,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"part three i think we can do this

there's"},{"startMs":1923440,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"there's there's a yeah they could uh if"},{"startMs":1926000,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"we're not there we can do the

60"},{"startMs":1957440,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"quantum"},{"startMs":1958559,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"uh atom traps in there and then

that"},{"startMs":2079760,"durationMs":6639,"subtitle":"that's pinpoint accuracy so um"},{"startMs":2082879,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and so i got a 5g phone but i don't have"},{"startMs":2086399,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"any 5g around here the only reason i got"},{"startMs":2087919,"durationMs":2321,"subtitle":"this phone is because the the camera

personally"},{"startMs":2103839,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"but"},{"startMs":2104320,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"um i also think that the 5g is being"},{"startMs":2107280,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"used for a lot of scapegoat things"},{"startMs":2109280,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"like people can blame everything on 5g"},{"startMs":2111440,"durationMs":5919,"subtitle":"when it's something totally different"},{"startMs":2114400,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"in my opinion yeah that's my

nanotechnology"},{"startMs":2217599,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"because carbon 60 is it's an element"},{"startMs":2219920,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"it's a molecule"},{"startMs":2220960,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"that's used in electronics so somebody"},{"startMs":2224000,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"they thought they they put those two"},{"startMs":2225359,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"things together"},{"startMs":2226400,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and they said oh it's a nanobot

you're"},{"startMs":2241040,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"thinking okay there's this element"},{"startMs":2242800,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"that's"},{"startMs":2243200,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"new and and and it's really small and"},{"startMs":2245920,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"you have to have an electron microscope"},{"startMs":2247599,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"to see it and it's"},{"startMs":2248720,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"and and it's in electronics and so if if"},{"startMs":2251760,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"somebody puts it in their body

so"},{"startMs":2304880,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"i'm starting you know and and i was i"},{"startMs":2307040,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"didn't know the very beginning right so"},{"startMs":2308880,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"when something's new and then it's so"},{"startMs":2310880,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"easy to make up something and"},{"startMs":2312480,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and i think that people probably had the"},{"startMs":2314320,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"right intentions and they were probably"},{"startMs":2315760,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"thinking that that"},{"startMs":2316960,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"so i i don't think that people are are"},{"startMs":2319839,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"unintelligent or ignorant"},{"startMs":2321839,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"when they say stuff like that i think a"},{"startMs":2323119,"durationMs":1761,"subtitle":"lot of them are probably

know"},{"startMs":2340560,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"it's it's 60 carbon atoms the people"},{"startMs":2342240,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"have those thoughts yeah 60 carbon atoms"},{"startMs":2345680,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"you know carbon-based things that sounds"},{"startMs":2347920,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"like an animal"},{"startMs":2348800,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"and you know and other people say like"},{"startMs":2351839,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"you know you've seen how c60 is purple"},{"startMs":2353599,"durationMs":2401,"subtitle":"right and when it's dissolved in coconut"},{"startMs":2355200,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"oil"},{"startMs":2356000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"and there's like some people out there"},{"startMs":2357280,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"saying oh it's carbon it can't be purple"},{"startMs":2360400,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"it's like you know because it's carbon"},{"startMs":2362320,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"carbon's supposed to be black well"},{"startMs":2363680,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"diamond diamond is perfect clear right"},{"startMs":2367280,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"it's not black because c60 it's like"},{"startMs":2369760,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"purple

uh"},{"startMs":2374480,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"c 84 is it's probably like a dark red"},{"startMs":2378079,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"i haven't got enough of it to do that"},{"startMs":2380480,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and so and all those things to do like"},{"startMs":2382240,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"c4 c84 they used to use c60 another use"},{"startMs":2384640,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"cd4"},{"startMs":2385440,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"they could pop c84 open it's like a"},{"startMs":2387280,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"little sphere and what they do is"},{"startMs":2389040,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"they take a nitrogen and then they can"},{"startMs":2390640,"durationMs":2719,"subtitle":"use they can attach three atoms to it"},{"startMs":2392160,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"like three ceriums"},{"startMs":2393359,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"or three europiums and stuff and then"},{"startMs":2395119,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"they can put it inside close it back"},{"startMs":2396640,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"up and they use it for catalysts for all"},{"startMs":2398720,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"kinds of like advanced chemistry and"},{"startMs":2400320,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"pharmaceutical stuff"},{"startMs":2401680,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"so and that's the the c80 and another"},{"startMs":2404400,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"one that they do is they use gadolinium"},{"startMs":2406000,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"you've heard of like"},{"startMs":2406960,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"they use uh what was what is that uh"},{"startMs":2410079,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"they use gadolinium for uh one of those"},{"startMs":2412880,"durationMs":2479,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":2413440,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"x-ray kind of things for

gadolinium"},{"startMs":2418400,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"poisoning because cations"},{"startMs":2420160,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"can be a toxic metal well they can"},{"startMs":2421440,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"either put the gadolidium in the c60"},{"startMs":2423119,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"molecule"},{"startMs":2423760,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"or they can put three of them in the c84"},{"startMs":2426160,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"which is much better"},{"startMs":2427280,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and then they can give it to people and"},{"startMs":2429200,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"they do this uh they do like some x-ray"},{"startMs":2431280,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"thing with the gadolinium"},{"startMs":2432560,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"and because galileo or maybe it works"},{"startMs":2434480,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"with a magnetic resonance saying i can't"},{"startMs":2436319,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"remember what it is at the moment"},{"startMs":2437760,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and instead of toxifying people because"},{"startMs":2439680,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"it's inside the carbon's 84"},{"startMs":2441920,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it just kind of washes out of
