with"},{"startMs":384880,"durationMs":6319,"subtitle":"it so and and"},{"startMs":387680,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and and um as a result i mean consequent"},{"startMs":391199,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"to having this ocean and"},{"startMs":392720,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"a few other factors it's the most

did"},{"startMs":1307919,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"stand up there"},{"startMs":1309360,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"but if you survived that for one second"},{"startMs":1311679,"durationMs":2561,"subtitle":"now you brought up the radiation thing"},{"startMs":1313440,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"and that is"},{"startMs":1314240,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"something i'd like to talk to you about"},{"startMs":1315520,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"because there's a lot of concern

air"},{"startMs":1336400,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"so we're talking like 60 times as high"},{"startMs":1338240,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"and i can you know we're still in the"},{"startMs":1339360,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"atmosphere here so"},{"startMs":1340640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"right right you know how are machines"},{"startMs":1342480,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"going to function in this kind of stuff"},{"startMs":1344640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"that one there are a couple different"},{"startMs":1346720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"ways um"},{"startMs":1348640,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"so in the case of clipper it's solving"},{"startMs":1350320,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"the problem by avoiding"},{"startMs":1351840,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"by going into the radiation and getting"},{"startMs":1354480,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"out of there as quickly as possible"},{"startMs":1356159,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"so it dips into the radiation and before"},{"startMs":1358720,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"it can do a number on the computer it's"},{"startMs":1360480,"durationMs":2079,"subtitle":"already zipping out because this

speeds"},{"startMs":1365760,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"um as a result um it's kind of like if"},{"startMs":1368720,"durationMs":1839,"subtitle":"you had a chocolate bar in your

10"},{"startMs":1375600,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"minutes"},{"startMs":1376320,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"it's going to be a gooey mess but if

seconds"},{"startMs":1382480,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"and then go back in"},{"startMs":1383440,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"it's going to maintain it's it's it's"},{"startMs":1385520,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it's integrity it's still going to be a"},{"startMs":1387039,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"chocolate bar that you can that can you"},{"startMs":1388480,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"can break and eat and it won't melt all"},{"startMs":1390080,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"over you"},{"startMs":1390640,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"and the same as that's the same way that"},{"startMs":1392400,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"the the clipper is going to work"},{"startMs":1394159,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"uh lander um is"},{"startMs":1397520,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"just going it's going to it's going to"},{"startMs":1398960,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"live hard and die young it'll probably"},{"startMs":1400799,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"have i think they said a 30-day

they"},{"startMs":1416320,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"don't know what the surface looks like"},{"startMs":1418000,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"so if we look at which sounds weird"},{"startMs":1419600,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"because we know exactly what europa"},{"startMs":1420960,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"looks like"},{"startMs":1421520,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"but when they say they don't know what"},{"startMs":1422880,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"the surface looks like it's kind of like"},{"startMs":1424640,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"if you look at a picture of earth from"},{"startMs":1426159,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"like the apollo program right you see"},{"startMs":1428080,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"earth right it's green there's north"},{"startMs":1429520,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"america but then it's like saying okay"},{"startMs":1431600,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"now land in central park"},{"startMs":1433200,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"like you could you have no idea

land"},{"startMs":1436960,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"there"},{"startMs":1437279,"durationMs":2561,"subtitle":"and lander would have to do the

see"},{"startMs":1443039,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"if there's you know see the what the"},{"startMs":1444559,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"surface looks like whether there's"},{"startMs":1446000,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"crevices or canyons or whatever"},{"startMs":1449200,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"but the legs sort of land independently"},{"startMs":1451679,"durationMs":2801,"subtitle":"and they sort of press down to keep the"},{"startMs":1453279,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"things stable"},{"startMs":1454480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and and horizontal and parallel with the"},{"startMs":1456720,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"ground so that the saw can

it's"},{"startMs":1461440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"it's extraordinary engineering but"},{"startMs":1463600,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"anyway they're radiation

this"},{"startMs":1482799,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"they could have a drone system or a"},{"startMs":1484480,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"lander that once it

pops"},{"startMs":1489840,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"out the top and then"},{"startMs":1492480,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and then you get this full
