to"},{"startMs":187379,"durationMs":6511,"subtitle":"talk about planets we have to talk about"},{"startMs":190470,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"stars first so we're gonna cover"},{"startMs":193890,"durationMs":4439,"subtitle":"basically three things we're going to"},{"startMs":195599,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"look at different star formation"},{"startMs":198329,"durationMs":5071,"subtitle":"theories we're gonna sort of it then"},{"startMs":201239,"durationMs":3991,"subtitle":"from that expand and look at how planets"},{"startMs":203400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"themselves are forms and then in"},{"startMs":205230,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"particular we're going to focus on

now"},{"startMs":219120,"durationMs":4259,"subtitle":"why start with stars I mean obviously"},{"startMs":221609,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"when you look at the night sky stars"},{"startMs":223379,"durationMs":5491,"subtitle":"other things that you see all the time"},{"startMs":225389,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"the sky is littered with stars and all"},{"startMs":228870,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"the models that we will look at"},{"startMs":230699,"durationMs":4591,"subtitle":"basically have stars forming first and"},{"startMs":233400,"durationMs":4169,"subtitle":"planets forming second so understanding"},{"startMs":235290,"durationMs":4589,"subtitle":"how the stars form helps you to"},{"startMs":237569,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"understand how planets form as well and"},{"startMs":239879,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"also when we look at stars"},{"startMs":243049,"durationMs":5891,"subtitle":"there is evidence that we think shows"},{"startMs":246419,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"how planets form but I'm going to show"},{"startMs":248940,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"you that maybe those fingerprints that"},{"startMs":251459,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"we see may not be planet formation at"},{"startMs":254160,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"all but we'll get onto that in a little"},{"startMs":256109,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"bit so let's let's start by looking at"},{"startMs":257760,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"stars now obviously when we talk about"},{"startMs":261030,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"star formation we are really talking"},{"startMs":262860,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"about now if we look out and then in the"},{"startMs":266159,"durationMs":3671,"subtitle":"universe there are"},{"startMs":267040,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"huge gas clouds and the idea is that"},{"startMs":269830,"durationMs":3090,"subtitle":"these gas clouds are just sort of"},{"startMs":271930,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"floating about"},{"startMs":272920,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"and obviously gravity acts on these gas"},{"startMs":276520,"durationMs":2970,"subtitle":"clouds and at some point imagine that"},{"startMs":278230,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"they are sort of little particles that"},{"startMs":279490,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"float inside of this gas cloud and"},{"startMs":282250,"durationMs":3630,"subtitle":"occasionally some of them will sort of"},{"startMs":283540,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"bump into each other and they might join"},{"startMs":285880,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"together and form a larger clump and"},{"startMs":288070,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"then slowly over time that clump starts"},{"startMs":290200,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"to grow and as it grows larger and"},{"startMs":291850,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"larger it will attract more and more"},{"startMs":294010,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"material and eventually as you see in"},{"startMs":296320,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"this sort of the diagram you'll end up"},{"startMs":297910,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"with a sort of a cloud being compressed"},{"startMs":299920,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"slowly downwards and that's what forms"},{"startMs":303160,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"the star that's sort of the the main"},{"startMs":304870,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"accepted hypothesis so large dust clouds"},{"startMs":308140,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"slowly collapse due to gravity

it"},{"startMs":315400,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"grows it gets larger and larger and as"},{"startMs":317320,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"it gets larger and larger the the forces"},{"startMs":319420,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"get larger as well I mean obviously be"},{"startMs":321580,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"if we look at the moon the gravity that"},{"startMs":325180,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"the experience when the moon is far less"},{"startMs":327130,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"on the earth and it would be the

thing"},{"startMs":333370,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"gets larger it starts to pull material"},{"startMs":335710,"durationMs":7590,"subtitle":"in with a greater force and

the"},{"startMs":359590,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"temperature get high enough and bang you"},{"startMs":361480,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"get fusion at the center of the star and"},{"startMs":363310,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"then it shines that's sort of the"},{"startMs":365860,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"accepted mainstream model but there are"},{"startMs":369010,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"problems with this model and the first"},{"startMs":371650,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"is as if you imagine that you you have"},{"startMs":374500,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"this material that sort of clumping down"},{"startMs":376480,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"if you can imagine at the moment the"},{"startMs":379030,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"model very much sort of works along I've"},{"startMs":381040,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"got these magnets here the concept of as"},{"startMs":384580,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"the material falls in it sort of gets"},{"startMs":386110,"durationMs":6450,"subtitle":"attracted and it sticks to it you know"},{"startMs":388270,"durationMs":6030,"subtitle":"and it gets ever and ever larger but you"},{"startMs":392560,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"know if you imagine that actually as"},{"startMs":394300,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"this object gets larger and larger the"},{"startMs":396520,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"force with which some of these particles"},{"startMs":399010,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"are being drawn in gets greater and"},{"startMs":400360,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"greater

it"},{"startMs":405400,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"it's not necessarily just going to stick"},{"startMs":407410,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"what is likely to happen is it will"},{"startMs":409570,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"fracture it if there's enough force I"},{"startMs":411850,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"mean you'll end up with two lumps so"},{"startMs":413620,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"you're you're no closer to solving this"},{"startMs":415630,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"problem and that's one of the biggest"},{"startMs":417550,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"problems facing sort of the mainstream"},{"startMs":419229,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"model is is this idea as as the object"},{"startMs":421360,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"it's larger but actually a force of the"},{"startMs":423310,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"impacts will cause it to sort of split"},{"startMs":425710,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"into more parts so the only way they can"},{"startMs":428080,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"get over that is they have to add in

down"},{"startMs":434800,"durationMs":5450,"subtitle":"enough that actually it's sort of gently"},{"startMs":437669,"durationMs":4870,"subtitle":"caresses and joins with that

forces"},{"startMs":454330,"durationMs":7170,"subtitle":"and I'll sort of explain in in a little"},{"startMs":457449,"durationMs":5551,"subtitle":"bit why those are important but when we"},{"startMs":461500,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"look at the object and objects falling"},{"startMs":463000,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"into it that is absolutely a force that"},{"startMs":465250,"durationMs":4169,"subtitle":"we need to take account of and the other"},{"startMs":467770,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"problem is that if we look at this image"},{"startMs":469419,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"to the side here that this image shows a"},{"startMs":472470,"durationMs":3910,"subtitle":"star-forming region so there are

this"},{"startMs":544210,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"you know 70 years ago he starts to look"},{"startMs":547000,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"into some of these topics and and he had"},{"startMs":549460,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"a separate theory based on the formation"},{"startMs":552460,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"of stars and then he also later looked"},{"startMs":554920,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"at how planets were formed same process"},{"startMs":557560,"durationMs":3630,"subtitle":"so again he assumes that there is this"},{"startMs":559180,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"this sort of interstellar gas cloud sort"},{"startMs":561190,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"of floating about but rather than"},{"startMs":564220,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"assuming that all these particles inside"},{"startMs":566020,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"of it are neutral particles he assumed"},{"startMs":568780,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"that they would be weakly ionized and by"},{"startMs":571840,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"weakly ionized what I mean is that there"},{"startMs":573430,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"are positive and negative charges within"},{"startMs":576760,"durationMs":7830,"subtitle":"that it isn't just a neutral particles"},{"startMs":580510,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and that these charged particles play a"},{"startMs":584590,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"very significant role in

that"},{"startMs":591820,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and you know he goes on to give an"},{"startMs":593890,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"example if we look at a proton yeah"},{"startMs":595840,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"which is a positive charge if we move a"},{"startMs":598600,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"proton to where the earth sits and we"},{"startMs":601330,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"sort of allow it to orbit at the same"},{"startMs":603760,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"speed as the earth then the force that"},{"startMs":606580,"durationMs":6350,"subtitle":"that proton experiences due to the"},{"startMs":609610,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"magnet magnetic force of the Sun is"},{"startMs":612930,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"60,000 times larger than the force that"},{"startMs":615610,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"it experiences due to the gravity

that"},{"startMs":833250,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"it will cause other material which is"},{"startMs":836370,"durationMs":4649,"subtitle":"neutral to become ionized as it

and"},{"startMs":848759,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"more ionization starts to take place and"},{"startMs":851129,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"then what happens is these particles"},{"startMs":854040,"durationMs":4409,"subtitle":"will start to want to follow the"},{"startMs":855509,"durationMs":4291,"subtitle":"magnetic field lines so again it is"},{"startMs":858449,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"important that we understand that and"},{"startMs":859800,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"take that into account when we look at"},{"startMs":861449,"durationMs":4471,"subtitle":"our model and he looked at again at the"},{"startMs":864240,"durationMs":4769,"subtitle":"grain size that we've talked about

idea"},{"startMs":884850,"durationMs":4349,"subtitle":"that if you imagine taking a cloud which"},{"startMs":886709,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"is let's say five billion kilometers"},{"startMs":889199,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"wide when you compress that down it goes"},{"startMs":891689,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"down to the size of only half a"},{"startMs":893699,"durationMs":4711,"subtitle":"kilometer so you have a massive"},{"startMs":896069,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"compression of that material in order to"},{"startMs":898410,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"form the star and he said that if the if"},{"startMs":901290,"durationMs":3989,"subtitle":"and when he did these calculations if"},{"startMs":902910,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"the grain size so those dust particles"},{"startMs":905279,"durationMs":5581,"subtitle":"that we talked about if they are less"},{"startMs":907949,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"than naught point one micrometers it"},{"startMs":910860,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"could take a billion years for that"},{"startMs":913199,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"material to slowly sort of compress down"},{"startMs":915660,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and inwards but he said if you if you"},{"startMs":918209,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"end up with material that is about you"},{"startMs":920040,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"know a tenth of a centimeter in size

very"},{"startMs":930970,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"long and slow process for that collapse"},{"startMs":933370,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"to take place so again taking account

how"},{"startMs":941320,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"quickly stars can be formed and some may"},{"startMs":945370,"durationMs":5270,"subtitle":"take a long time and some might be

sort"},{"startMs":953040,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"of Alvin's hybrid model of the"},{"startMs":955769,"durationMs":4741,"subtitle":"mainstream model then there's the

those"},{"startMs":2167500,"durationMs":5890,"subtitle":"and again if we look another weird thing"},{"startMs":2170329,"durationMs":5311,"subtitle":"if we look at ah if we just look at the"},{"startMs":2173390,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"planets then the weird thing is that"},{"startMs":2175640,"durationMs":5610,"subtitle":"there are sort of two categories you"},{"startMs":2178250,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"know predominantly of angles and these"},{"startMs":2181250,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"are the angles that they orbit at so

much"},{"startMs":2187580,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"up right when we look at the way they"},{"startMs":2189440,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"orbit around their axis obviously earth"},{"startMs":2191720,"durationMs":6290,"subtitle":"we're sort of inclined at 23 degrees"},{"startMs":2193580,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"Mars is 25 Saturn 27 and Neptune at 28"},{"startMs":2198010,"durationMs":6700,"subtitle":"so you know is there any clue in that I"},{"startMs":2201680,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"don't know why are those similar to"},{"startMs":2204710,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"others obviously in the electric"},{"startMs":2207470,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"universe theory there obviously the idea"},{"startMs":2209000,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"is that some of these were part of"},{"startMs":2210470,"durationMs":5630,"subtitle":"Saturn which was separate star

that's"},{"startMs":2219680,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"possible again we don't necessarily have"},{"startMs":2221600,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"definitive proof of that"},{"startMs":2222890,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"but it is odd that some of these have a"},{"startMs":2226190,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"very different inclination like if"},{"startMs":2228410,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"you're forming them through collapsed"},{"startMs":2230330,"durationMs":3630,"subtitle":"and why is some of them tilts I mean"},{"startMs":2232160,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"obviously the mainstream model tries to"},{"startMs":2233960,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"explain it by meteor impacts sort

why"},{"startMs":2242240,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"is it basically two different groups I"},{"startMs":2243860,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"mean Venus you can sort of ignore"},{"startMs":2244940,"durationMs":6110,"subtitle":"because that's actually upside down so"},{"startMs":2247520,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"again Venus is a bit weird because I"},{"startMs":2251050,"durationMs":3430,"subtitle":"mean how do you determine that it's"},{"startMs":2252980,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"upside down that's more to do with it's"},{"startMs":2254480,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"sort of magnetic field so there are"},{"startMs":2257359,"durationMs":4861,"subtitle":"oddities in this in the solar system"},{"startMs":2259400,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"again if we look at magnetic field bear"},{"startMs":2262220,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"weird as well if we look at

know"},{"startMs":2279530,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"they sort of argue that the gas giants"},{"startMs":2282670,"durationMs":5050,"subtitle":"have what we know that they have"},{"startMs":2285380,"durationMs":4190,"subtitle":"magnetic fields that the reason for the"},{"startMs":2287720,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"magnetic fields is different in each

electrically"},{"startMs":2308869,"durationMs":4051,"subtitle":"powered so as long as you get power you"},{"startMs":2311000,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"would form the same sort of

questions"},{"startMs":2329390,"durationMs":7290,"subtitle":"again if we look at composition so the"},{"startMs":2333000,"durationMs":7170,"subtitle":"Sun is 75% hydrogen and 15%

93"},{"startMs":2343470,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"percent hydrogen and only 3% helium and"},{"startMs":2346620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"then Neptune is 80 and then 19 so
