all"},{"startMs":328240,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"this stuff but not at all what i'm"},{"startMs":329840,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"saying is if there were much

let's"},{"startMs":354080,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"just go back into the triassic or the"},{"startMs":356720,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"jurassic or the cretaceous and we have"},{"startMs":359120,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"large dinosaur bones i mean some of the"},{"startMs":361680,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"bones are

understand"},{"startMs":397039,"durationMs":6081,"subtitle":"all f"},{"startMs":399199,"durationMs":6401,"subtitle":"ra all fossils are stone"},{"startMs":403120,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"okay so so"},{"startMs":405600,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"so it is possible that some of these"},{"startMs":408080,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"rocks could be"},{"startMs":410160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"giant body parts"},{"startMs":412639,"durationMs":2241,"subtitle":"then no"},{"startMs":414000,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"no"},{"startMs":414880,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"because the difference is that a fossil"},{"startMs":418160,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"is is is a fossil"},{"startMs":420560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and something shaped like a fossil is a"},{"startMs":423280,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"fantasy"},{"startMs":424560,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"because the difference between a fossil"},{"startMs":426960,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"and a fantasy is that one is shaped like"},{"startMs":429759,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"a fossil and the other one is an actual"},{"startMs":432639,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"fossil"},{"startMs":433759,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"and the reason we know it's a fossil is"},{"startMs":435680,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"because"},{"startMs":436880,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"most of the time it it has the complete"},{"startMs":439440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"morphology of the actual thing"},{"startMs":441840,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"which what i mean by that is if we go to"},{"startMs":444000,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"petrified forest and get a petrified log"},{"startMs":446800,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"and we cut it in the lab and we make a"},{"startMs":449599,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"thin section and i look at it and this"},{"startMs":451919,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"is something from a hundred and fifty"},{"startMs":453840,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"million years ago"},{"startMs":456960,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"i have it right here i have it right"},{"startMs":458639,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"here"},{"startMs":460240,"durationMs":5079,"subtitle":"okay okay go gravel yeah do it"},{"startMs":465440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"so this is from the arizona petrified"},{"startMs":468319,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"forest"},{"startMs":470080,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"yeah that's the main one"},{"startMs":471919,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"so if you were to cut that rock"},{"startMs":474639,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"perpendicular to the length"},{"startMs":476960,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and look inside of it what you're going"},{"startMs":478479,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"to see is uh the actual cells"},{"startMs":481680,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"the xylem from the plant from the tree"},{"startMs":484240,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"you're going to see it all preserved"},{"startMs":486879,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"what has happened is it went from a"},{"startMs":488560,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"carbon-based product wood and it's been"},{"startMs":491280,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"now transferred to silica so it's"},{"startMs":494240,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"actually called splicified wood"},{"startMs":496960,"durationMs":5519,"subtitle":"petrified wood is called solicified wood"},{"startMs":500160,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"so that when and we know it's a fossil"},{"startMs":502479,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"because when we study it in the lab we"},{"startMs":504160,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"cut it"},{"startMs":505360,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"four microns thin we look through it and"},{"startMs":507440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"it has the same cells we could see the"},{"startMs":509759,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"plant cells we could see the cell wall"},{"startMs":512000,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"we could see the xylem and the

fossil"},{"startMs":517519,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"is not a fossil it's something that"},{"startMs":520479,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"looks like or a shape like something"},{"startMs":522959,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"that someone thinks is a fossil"},{"startMs":525279,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"but it's just a rock typically

when"},{"startMs":560560,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"earlier when we were talking to somebody"},{"startMs":562080,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"about the the mud fossils and they were"},{"startMs":564399,"durationMs":5601,"subtitle":"presenting these two rocks that look"},{"startMs":567040,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"like lungs but one was of granite
