this"},{"startMs":835500,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"but a colleague of mine actually said"},{"startMs":837720,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"well if these poll locations are correct"},{"startMs":840420,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"there should be some way of using"},{"startMs":842700,"durationMs":5819,"subtitle":"climate data to verify them"},{"startMs":845760,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"and uh and he does just that in his book"},{"startMs":848519,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"his book is called um"},{"startMs":850680,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"uh what is it called uh it's called Uh I"},{"startMs":854040,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"have it over here"},{"startMs":855180,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"oh deep history in the ages of man his"},{"startMs":858180,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"name is is Mark Gaffney and uh he's an"},{"startMs":860639,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"environmentalist and he actually looked"},{"startMs":862620,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"at climate data and determined that"},{"startMs":865560,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"these poll these polls um"},{"startMs":868380,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"these pole shifts explain

all in the"},{"startMs":922079,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"book and it's all on the website but if"},{"startMs":924060,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"the North Poles it is is in the

you"},{"startMs":938220,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"put the North Pole there and so that"},{"startMs":940440,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"explains why those animals"},{"startMs":943860,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"oh perfect that explains why those"},{"startMs":946800,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"animals were um existing"},{"startMs":949860,"durationMs":5479,"subtitle":"at that time this might be an animation"},{"startMs":952500,"durationMs":2839,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":955860,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"so it"},{"startMs":957300,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"is this the right one or should I be"},{"startMs":959220,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"somewhere else"},{"startMs":961199,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"yeah so so yeah that's that's a good one"},{"startMs":963660,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"but it keeps changing"},{"startMs":965279,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"um so like I need to stop it somehow but"},{"startMs":967560,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"it won't because it's animation uh yeah"},{"startMs":969779,"durationMs":6321,"subtitle":"let me see uh do I have another

anyway"},{"startMs":978839,"durationMs":2821,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":979800,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"right I don't interrupt sorry about

know"},{"startMs":987839,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"sort of get get to the bottom line which"},{"startMs":990000,"durationMs":5699,"subtitle":"is you know looking at this this uh"},{"startMs":992820,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"basically what animals were living uh in"},{"startMs":995699,"durationMs":5241,"subtitle":"these bone caves at different times

scientists"},{"startMs":1036559,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"would never uh"},{"startMs":1039339,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"adopt this kind of a theory because it's"},{"startMs":1041839,"durationMs":4441,"subtitle":"it's totally out of the box right I mean"},{"startMs":1044299,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"the current Paradigm is"},{"startMs":1046280,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"the North Pole hasn't changed it's it's"},{"startMs":1048439,"durationMs":5661,"subtitle":"been there and climate

to"},{"startMs":1066260,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"pole shifts and that's that's kind of"},{"startMs":1068179,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"the key that's the foundation of this"},{"startMs":1070220,"durationMs":2339,"subtitle":"Theory"},{"startMs":1071780,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1072559,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"and uh and so if that's the theory do"},{"startMs":1076160,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"you accept that sort of provisionally"},{"startMs":1078200,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"like okay so what are the implications"},{"startMs":1080740,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"it explains all these archaeological"},{"startMs":1083360,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"sites so not only does it fit the"},{"startMs":1085760,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"climate data but it explains all these"},{"startMs":1088220,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"archaeological sites so it's it's kind"},{"startMs":1090200,"durationMs":4859,"subtitle":"of a nice"},{"startMs":1091460,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"there's nice Synergy between the two"},{"startMs":1095059,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"and if we look at these pole shifts that"},{"startMs":1097160,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"take place like are they physical pole"},{"startMs":1099020,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"shifts are they grab like magnetic pole"},{"startMs":1101120,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"shifts"},{"startMs":1102020,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"so uh great question so so the um you"},{"startMs":1106940,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"know the the Earth's"},{"startMs":1109340,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"um outer crust"},{"startMs":1111200,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"uh is composed of a bunch of plates that"},{"startMs":1114140,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"move"},{"startMs":1115280,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"and the uh the the current theory is"},{"startMs":1118160,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"that they move based on uh mantle"},{"startMs":1120380,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"convection so it's heat coming up
