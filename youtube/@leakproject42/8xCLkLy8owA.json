to"},{"startMs":378360,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"again how creative the human mind is"},{"startMs":382740,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"yeah absolutely the mound builders out"},{"startMs":385560,"durationMs":5639,"subtitle":"here in America when they found certain"},{"startMs":389400,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"mummies in these Mounds they oftentimes"},{"startMs":391199,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"had relics uh within within the graves"},{"startMs":394440,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"and the sarcophagus and it just

extra"},{"startMs":422520,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"stuff in a tomb we can assume that they"},{"startMs":425940,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"all had stuff because the idea was that"},{"startMs":429960,"durationMs":7079,"subtitle":"these things in the Tomb these artifacts"},{"startMs":433500,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"and all the art in the Tomb would become"},{"startMs":437039,"durationMs":7621,"subtitle":"magically available to the person in the"},{"startMs":440400,"durationMs":7799,"subtitle":"next life and so if the deceased had led"},{"startMs":444660,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"a good life and they did go on to the"},{"startMs":448199,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"great beyond they would be able to
