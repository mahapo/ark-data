in"},{"startMs":271680,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"your home at this point so we started to"},{"startMs":274160,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"see that the who's the people in"},{"startMs":276000,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"government and the institution itself is"},{"startMs":277840,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"really really important in our lives

really the crux of the whole"},{"startMs":308400,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"matter for me is that when you think"},{"startMs":310639,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"about what the government does it"},{"startMs":311759,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"provides services to all of us which are"},{"startMs":313840,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"super important services i wouldn't
