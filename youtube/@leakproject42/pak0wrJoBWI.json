yes"},{"startMs":328720,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"um will it cost a hundred billion"},{"startMs":331039,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"dollars no"},{"startMs":332000,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"it can probably be done within the"},{"startMs":334240,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"existing nasa budget this guy

step"},{"startMs":346960,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"up and do that meet him halfway and"},{"startMs":350320,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and then they'll say well then let's do"},{"startMs":352560,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"this"},{"startMs":353520,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"and so we'll be on mars by 2030."},{"startMs":356800,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"now in terms of when"},{"startMs":360240,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"uh people in the the broader public will"},{"startMs":364160,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"be able to go to mars uh"},{"startMs":368639,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"i think that some people"},{"startMs":371680,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"will be able to go to mars not"},{"startMs":373840,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"necessarily for casual vacations but"},{"startMs":376160,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"let's say you wanted to do scientific"},{"startMs":378000,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"research on mars"},{"startMs":379440,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"same kind of people that can get trips"},{"startMs":382080,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"to the high"},{"startMs":382960,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"arctic or antarctica to do

dollars"},{"startMs":407600,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and then maybe 10 years after that we'll"},{"startMs":410479,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"start seeing"},{"startMs":411840,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"tourists and immigrants"},{"startMs":416240,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"yeah yeah and to get there"},{"startMs":419840,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"as of right now how how long would it"},{"startMs":422720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"take"},{"startMs":423759,"durationMs":5121,"subtitle":"to get there from here if we left"},{"startMs":426400,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"tomorrow is it six months is it a year"},{"startMs":428880,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"six months um in fact"},{"startMs":432560,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"that's with current propulsion in fact"},{"startMs":434160,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"that's how long it took the insight"},{"startMs":436319,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"probe to travel from earth to mars"},{"startMs":438880,"durationMs":5439,"subtitle":"in uh 2018. that's how long it took"},{"startMs":442160,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"spirit and opportunity to fly to mars"},{"startMs":444319,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"we can do that with chemical propulsion"},{"startMs":446720,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":447520,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"um and in fact while if you really pour"},{"startMs":450560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"on the gas"},{"startMs":451599,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"you can get there a bit faster than that"},{"startMs":454000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"uh i"},{"startMs":454800,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"would recommend"},{"startMs":458720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"taking the six-month orbit for two"},{"startMs":460479,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"reasons one"},{"startMs":462160,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"is that yes you could get there faster"},{"startMs":465680,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"if you really pour on the propellant"},{"startMs":467520,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"but that's equivalent to taking less"},{"startMs":469599,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"payload for a given launch mass"},{"startMs":472000,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"and your safety is going to maximize uh"},{"startMs":475440,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"more with more payload and more backup"},{"startMs":478560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"systems and everything like that"},{"startMs":480720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"then reducing the trip time from six"},{"startMs":483120,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"months to four months"},{"startMs":484400,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"okay so that's one thing and another"},{"startMs":486240,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"thing is the six month orbit to mars"},{"startMs":488879,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"is also the free return orbit that is if"},{"startMs":491280,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"you decide to"},{"startMs":492000,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"abort you can fly past mars and loop"},{"startMs":494160,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"around and you'll come back"},{"startMs":495680,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"to earth exactly two years after you"},{"startMs":498560,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"left it"},{"startMs":499280,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"which means the earth will be there okay"},{"startMs":502160,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"if you"},{"startMs":502879,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"if you go out further if you go faster"},{"startMs":505599,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and you abort you'll loop out further"},{"startMs":507280,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"you'll come back in more than two years"},{"startMs":509199,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":509440,"durationMs":6959,"subtitle":"you'll miss the earth um so"},{"startMs":513919,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"because you get the free return and"},{"startMs":516399,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"because it's"},{"startMs":517519,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"uh propellant and payload efficient i"},{"startMs":519519,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"would take the six-month orbit"},{"startMs":522479,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"you know this reminds me of a trip to"},{"startMs":524240,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"antarctica 100 years ago"},{"startMs":527440,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"well or a trip to australia in the 1800s"},{"startMs":530560,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"which was done by"},{"startMs":531600,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"hundreds of thousands of immigrants uh"},{"startMs":533920,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"took about six months to sell from"},{"startMs":535440,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"england to australia"},{"startMs":538000,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"now that yeah and if we get to"},{"startMs":541120,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"geo-engineering mars is that even a"},{"startMs":543680,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"possibility are we gonna have to live

the"},{"startMs":549600,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"spacecraft"},{"startMs":550480,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"that we land in and then in yes domes"},{"startMs":553360,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"and in"},{"startMs":554160,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"tunnel systems comparable to indoor"},{"startMs":556399,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"malls and such"},{"startMs":558160,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"um and maybe combination of those in"},{"startMs":560959,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"domes"},{"startMs":561760,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"but eventually uh people will"},{"startMs":565040,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"uh address the question of altering"},{"startMs":568640,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"mars okay uh now mars can be altered"},{"startMs":572560,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"locally and it could be altered globally"},{"startMs":576000,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"um locally uh you could alter mars"},{"startMs":579680,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"by taking some of these frozen lakes and"},{"startMs":581760,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"melting them under the surface"},{"startMs":583680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and you'd have a complete

habitat or something um you"},{"startMs":600399,"durationMs":2481,"subtitle":"know"},{"startMs":601360,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and and do that and then you you
