the"},{"startMs":817630,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"other really intriguing thing is that"},{"startMs":819850,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"the granite which the box is made up or"},{"startMs":823570,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"in some cases at syenite which is the"},{"startMs":825640,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"type of granite either came from

not"},{"startMs":836630,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"simply a question of the size and scale"},{"startMs":838730,"durationMs":4229,"subtitle":"of the boxes is the fact that they

just"},{"startMs":853959,"durationMs":5011,"subtitle":"amazing feat first of all the Granite's"},{"startMs":857800,"durationMs":2849,"subtitle":"like there's got to be a reason

the"},{"startMs":863620,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"reason why they use granite is that it's"},{"startMs":865300,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"very high in quartz crystal and quartz"},{"startMs":867519,"durationMs":6271,"subtitle":"has a piezoelectric effect or vibratory"},{"startMs":870670,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"effect to it if you climb inside one

one"},{"startMs":877810,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"specific sound and that is own and only"},{"startMs":880750,"durationMs":7110,"subtitle":"ohm the whole box resonates when you"},{"startMs":883930,"durationMs":6409,"subtitle":"make that sound that's amazing that is"},{"startMs":887860,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"so cool that is one of the most

type"},{"startMs":972070,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"of magic that is absolutely real that's"},{"startMs":974800,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"like science in a sense or what do you"},{"startMs":976660,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"think their purpose was The Book of the"},{"startMs":977980,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"Dead and some of these just

I"},{"startMs":1016110,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"think that actually hieroglyphics are"},{"startMs":1018000,"durationMs":6209,"subtitle":"more than 12,000 years old and that the"},{"startMs":1021120,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"dynastic people adopted that system and"},{"startMs":1024209,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"altered the meaning of the symbols

well"},{"startMs":1042030,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"what was the precursor script or code"},{"startMs":1045750,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"before that and he said there wasn't
