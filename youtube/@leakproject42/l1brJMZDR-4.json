this"},{"startMs":891660,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"story was a proof of Planet X and the"},{"startMs":894180,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"bureau because if you read a story it"},{"startMs":896699,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"looks as if it's a battle between"},{"startMs":898260,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"different gods but if you look at it"},{"startMs":900540,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"metaphorically it could be a story about"},{"startMs":903120,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"how our solar system came to be

beginning"},{"startMs":1056780,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"um so basically what I'm what I'm"},{"startMs":1058940,"durationMs":3479,"subtitle":"getting at with all of that is that"},{"startMs":1060500,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"there is obvious precedent in the"},{"startMs":1062419,"durationMs":5061,"subtitle":"creation stories of our ancient world
