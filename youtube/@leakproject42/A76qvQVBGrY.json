the"},{"startMs":313660,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"only way that they can make it appear is"},{"startMs":315870,"durationMs":4870,"subtitle":"dark matter so what they say is that"},{"startMs":318340,"durationMs":5670,"subtitle":"dark matter clumped along these lines"},{"startMs":320740,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"and cause normal matter to be

giant"},{"startMs":350980,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"brain they look like Universal synapses"},{"startMs":352900,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"it's incredible yeah and actually when"},{"startMs":354970,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"we look a little bit later on we see the"},{"startMs":356560,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"same scale repeating further down

quite"},{"startMs":362980,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"identical but that stars also seem to"},{"startMs":365530,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"form along these filaments so like a"},{"startMs":368380,"durationMs":3590,"subtitle":"fractal repeating pattern"},{"startMs":376010,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"okay so they think it's made through"},{"startMs":379070,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"dark matter and they think that the"},{"startMs":380540,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"majority of the material in

not"},{"startMs":387470,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"ionized so it's just inert just sat"},{"startMs":389540,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"there and of course in their

galaxies"},{"startMs":408050,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"we're going to look at it in a slightly"},{"startMs":409730,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"different way in a little bit but what's"},{"startMs":412310,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"interesting is that we know that the"},{"startMs":414050,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"galaxies will cluster we obviously know"},{"startMs":417320,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"that stars cluster to form galaxies but"},{"startMs":419570,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"galaxies cluster to form clusters

so"},{"startMs":428240,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"there's like a hierarchy to to this sort"},{"startMs":430460,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"of order and and we are actually part of"},{"startMs":432830,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"the Virgo supercluster so here is an"},{"startMs":436190,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"image of so we sit about here and this"},{"startMs":439610,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"is the Virgo supercluster and the"},{"startMs":443090,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"material that we're in and again there"},{"startMs":445790,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"is a caveat to how this is obtained but"},{"startMs":447860,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"just for now what's happening is this"},{"startMs":451310,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"material is being moved in this"},{"startMs":453170,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"direction towards the Great

something"},{"startMs":459050,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"that we should talk about at a separate"},{"startMs":460640,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"time is what is the Great Attractor and"},{"startMs":462980,"durationMs":4130,"subtitle":"why is all of this moving and again is"},{"startMs":464690,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"there a different way to look at this"},{"startMs":467110,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"but for now this is this is that the"},{"startMs":470090,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"structure that we're in and this"},{"startMs":471530,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"comprises the Virgo cluster is about a"},{"startMs":473390,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"thousand of those clusters of galaxies"},{"startMs":476450,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"so a vast number of galaxies are"},{"startMs":478610,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"included in that now what's interesting"},{"startMs":481430,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"is when we look at that web what we see"},{"startMs":483800,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"is that galaxies tend to form not only"},{"startMs":486500,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"along those but where and if we if I"},{"startMs":489710,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"just jump back to the other one where we"},{"startMs":491570,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"have sort of the interconnector so where"},{"startMs":494990,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"we have different paths

actually"},{"startMs":511129,"durationMs":4171,"subtitle":"forming and again that's difficult for"},{"startMs":513349,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"for mainstream to explain because why is"},{"startMs":515300,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"it that they're focusing more on where"},{"startMs":518390,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"connections occur rather than

500"},{"startMs":535760,"durationMs":7079,"subtitle":"galaxies nearby to earth within a 400"},{"startMs":539540,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"million light years and what they

what's"},{"startMs":2054010,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"interesting is if you look at its motion"},{"startMs":2055510,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"it is actually a sort of a curved

use"},{"startMs":2125849,"durationMs":5701,"subtitle":"that linear motion and my point is that"},{"startMs":2129000,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"if actually the motion of the stars is"},{"startMs":2131550,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"not linear for some of them because"},{"startMs":2133260,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"obviously it depends on those that are"},{"startMs":2135300,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"in the filament that turn with us then"},{"startMs":2137580,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"in fact where you're calculating a"},{"startMs":2139470,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"straight motion you would end up with"},{"startMs":2140790,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"that sort of a path but in fact if you"},{"startMs":2143700,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"were to look for long enough you might"},{"startMs":2145260,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"see a curved path so again this is parts"},{"startMs":2150240,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"of the problem we haven't I mean we"},{"startMs":2152220,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"obviously have but we don't believe that"},{"startMs":2154050,"durationMs":4049,"subtitle":"our ancestors were capable of doing that"},{"startMs":2155910,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"but we haven't been observing the

curved"},{"startMs":2163619,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"path but that's certainly what I believe"},{"startMs":2165540,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"that some of the stars are actually"},{"startMs":2167640,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"doing so in terms of when we look at"},{"startMs":2170339,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"stars you know that's over the lifespan"},{"startMs":2172710,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"of thousands of years those positions"},{"startMs":2174599,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"would change when we look at galaxies I"},{"startMs":2177300,"durationMs":3539,"subtitle":"mean obviously they are much much bigger"},{"startMs":2178920,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"and they move much much slower"},{"startMs":2180839,"durationMs":5191,"subtitle":"so in that case their positions do"},{"startMs":2183270,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"change but obviously not necessarily in"},{"startMs":2186030,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"in our lifetime and not necessarily very"},{"startMs":2188550,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"much in terms of a life span off of"},{"startMs":2191190,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"humanity itself so and obviously when we"},{"startMs":2194730,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"look at the the sky part of the problem"},{"startMs":2198150,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"is that we're looking at history because"},{"startMs":2201060,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"obviously light travels that are at a"},{"startMs":2202470,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"fixed speed so the further objects are"},{"startMs":2204930,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"away that the older the light is so"},{"startMs":2207599,"durationMs":3421,"subtitle":"that's part of the problem when we look"},{"startMs":2209280,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"as well is that that you're not seeing"},{"startMs":2211020,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"the here and now you're seeing as you"},{"startMs":2213510,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"look further out you're seeing more aged"},{"startMs":2216060,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"and more further back in time"},{"startMs":2218910,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"effectively so that again is something"},{"startMs":2221880,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"that you you sort of have to look the"},{"startMs":2223710,"durationMs":3570,"subtitle":"filter on in terms of when we look at"},{"startMs":2225330,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"the universe and certainly there's a"},{"startMs":2227280,"durationMs":4130,"subtitle":"limit to how far we can currently"},{"startMs":2229320,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"telescopes are getting better but"},{"startMs":2231410,"durationMs":4570,"subtitle":"realized that a lot of the images that"},{"startMs":2233460,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"we look at you know when they talk about"},{"startMs":2235980,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"always you know we found a new red dwarf"},{"startMs":2237840,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"or we found a new white dwarf we found a"},{"startMs":2240300,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"new neutron star that the quality

know"},{"startMs":2246240,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"they're very blurry and open to"},{"startMs":2248490,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"interpretation so there are many"},{"startMs":2250890,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"different ways that you could you could"},{"startMs":2252330,"durationMs":5030,"subtitle":"look at this I'm not sure that's really"},{"startMs":2254430,"durationMs":2930,"subtitle":"answered your question"},{"startMs":2257859,"durationMs":5341,"subtitle":"that that's okay I'm just assuming that"},{"startMs":2260619,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"it's kind of because of our orbits and"},{"startMs":2263200,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"and position in space and the way that"},{"startMs":2265809,"durationMs":4591,"subtitle":"everything moves it seems is from from a"},{"startMs":2268959,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"layman's terms or for something

it"},{"startMs":2274930,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"looks like it's not movie because we're"},{"startMs":2277269,"durationMs":5131,"subtitle":"all kind of connected and synced up so"},{"startMs":2279940,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"you know for example our bodies folks"},{"startMs":2282400,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"think about this for a minute your body"},{"startMs":2283779,"durationMs":4351,"subtitle":"is made up of quadrillions of floating"},{"startMs":2286420,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"points that are bouncing around and"},{"startMs":2288130,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"moving all over the place and and you"},{"startMs":2289900,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"don't see that for some reason you're"},{"startMs":2291969,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"you look like a solid piece of matter"},{"startMs":2293859,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you can sit down on a chair and not

the"},{"startMs":2299440,"durationMs":7519,"subtitle":"desk so there's a lot of things that in"},{"startMs":2303009,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"my opinion aren't explained for"},{"startMs":2306959,"durationMs":2770,"subtitle":"perfectly you know I mean there's a lot"},{"startMs":2308829,"durationMs":2040,"subtitle":"of stuff out that that we're still"},{"startMs":2309729,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"trying to connect the dots but if you"},{"startMs":2310869,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"look at the overall picture of this"},{"startMs":2312729,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"being like a fractal and holographic in"},{"startMs":2314829,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"nature and and almost like a simulation"},{"startMs":2317259,"durationMs":2911,"subtitle":"theory and that doesn't mean it's not"},{"startMs":2318309,"durationMs":3571,"subtitle":"real when I say simulation this is very"},{"startMs":2320170,"durationMs":4529,"subtitle":"real I'm just talking about the science"},{"startMs":2321880,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"and the aspect of the fractals and and"},{"startMs":2324699,"durationMs":5191,"subtitle":"in the sum of the whole where and the"},{"startMs":2327339,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"way that things will duplicate as above"},{"startMs":2329890,"durationMs":4589,"subtitle":"so below and the characteristics they"},{"startMs":2332319,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"all just seem to kind of connect to this"},{"startMs":2334479,"durationMs":6390,"subtitle":"simulated nature now so then the next"},{"startMs":2338979,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"question is this is where it gets really"},{"startMs":2340869,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"deep and I've asked this before and I"},{"startMs":2343059,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"don't know if it's came across the right"},{"startMs":2344289,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"way but so if this is a simulation and"},{"startMs":2346269,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"we get out of the simulation what is it"},{"startMs":2348519,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"like outside of the simulation does that"},{"startMs":2350319,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"mean that there is no in-between that"},{"startMs":2352959,"durationMs":3721,"subtitle":"there are no particles everything is"},{"startMs":2354579,"durationMs":4351,"subtitle":"just a solid mass or is it even more of"},{"startMs":2356680,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"a holographic nature very very"},{"startMs":2358930,"durationMs":5429,"subtitle":"interesting to think about have you ever"},{"startMs":2360819,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"thought about stuff like that um so I"},{"startMs":2364359,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"mean that comes back to the question is"},{"startMs":2365709,"durationMs":4471,"subtitle":"I I personally I think is is what is"},{"startMs":2368229,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"consciousness which is a slightly"},{"startMs":2370180,"durationMs":5189,"subtitle":"different take on being you know"},{"startMs":2372430,"durationMs":4679,"subtitle":"holographic universe or a virtual"},{"startMs":2375369,"durationMs":5551,"subtitle":"reality universe but effectively the"},{"startMs":2377109,"durationMs":6930,"subtitle":"idea that we create the reality that we"},{"startMs":2380920,"durationMs":5639,"subtitle":"see so it is our minds than in fact and"},{"startMs":2384039,"durationMs":4111,"subtitle":"and probably our minds as a collective"},{"startMs":2386559,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"and again looking back at the structure"},{"startMs":2388150,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"of the universe you could argue that it"},{"startMs":2389680,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"is hardly the universe as well"},{"startMs":2391750,"durationMs":8580,"subtitle":"that is responsible for creating that"},{"startMs":2394630,"durationMs":7710,"subtitle":"and in which case I mean what is real"},{"startMs":2400330,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"you know it comes back to that sort of a"},{"startMs":2402340,"durationMs":4529,"subtitle":"fundamental question is when you say"},{"startMs":2405160,"durationMs":3330,"subtitle":"that you touch the desk or when I say"},{"startMs":2406869,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"that I see you or when I say that I'm"},{"startMs":2408490,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"speaking to you really the only thing"},{"startMs":2411099,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"that I'm aware of is what my brain is"},{"startMs":2412840,"durationMs":6050,"subtitle":"interpreting and that is through a

it"},{"startMs":2421599,"durationMs":5311,"subtitle":"does anything so you know who knows what"},{"startMs":2424960,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"the real universe actually is you know"},{"startMs":2426910,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"the fact that you think you can touch it"},{"startMs":2429300,"durationMs":4150,"subtitle":"doesn't mean that it actually looks like"},{"startMs":2431410,"durationMs":4439,"subtitle":"that that's the way your brain is is"},{"startMs":2433450,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"programmed to actually interpret that"},{"startMs":2435849,"durationMs":5581,"subtitle":"image and if for a second you imagine"},{"startMs":2438970,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"that actually we create everything with"},{"startMs":2441430,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"our mind and it's a joint sort of effort"},{"startMs":2444099,"durationMs":5941,"subtitle":"that causes this stuff to be

those"},{"startMs":2451720,"durationMs":4730,"subtitle":"things then your question of what"},{"startMs":2454570,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"happens when you're removed out of that"},{"startMs":2456450,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"well my answer would be you you you"},{"startMs":2458890,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"couldn't because you are an integral"},{"startMs":2460690,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"part of it you can't remove yourself"},{"startMs":2463480,"durationMs":8040,"subtitle":"because you are are it therefore it's"},{"startMs":2466900,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"like a you know a catch-22 remove"},{"startMs":2471520,"durationMs":3030,"subtitle":"yourself and it doesn't exist and if it"},{"startMs":2473140,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"doesn't exist that means that you"},{"startMs":2474550,"durationMs":3170,"subtitle":"yourself don't exist"},{"startMs":2478800,"durationMs":3809,"subtitle":"it's like taking a piece it's like"},{"startMs":2480270,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"taking away one of the Pistons of an"},{"startMs":2482609,"durationMs":4621,"subtitle":"engine yeah what you're saying so so"},{"startMs":2485460,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"you're a sum of the whole so how do you"},{"startMs":2487230,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"take yourself out of that therefore you"},{"startMs":2488700,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"be nothing now it's all perspective I"},{"startMs":2490830,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"guess so for anybody out there that's"},{"startMs":2492839,"durationMs":6481,"subtitle":"ever had an out-of-body experience it's"},{"startMs":2495630,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"amazing it's as good as it's just as"},{"startMs":2499320,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"good if not better than almost anything"},{"startMs":2502200,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"let's just put it that way it's"},{"startMs":2503130,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"absolutely incredible and I've gone so"},{"startMs":2506190,"durationMs":3330,"subtitle":"far out before that I felt like I was"},{"startMs":2508050,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"looking at it looked like I was

was"},{"startMs":2521880,"durationMs":4850,"subtitle":"observing it but like you said I was"},{"startMs":2524160,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"still I was still in

that"},{"startMs":2752779,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"in their idea is that there is some"},{"startMs":2755909,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"massive object in front of you so it"},{"startMs":2759179,"durationMs":6150,"subtitle":"could be one of these galaxies super"},{"startMs":2761969,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"clusters and this causes the light to

you"},{"startMs":2770069,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"see around there on different sides is"},{"startMs":2772469,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"is light does actually from very

can't"},{"startMs":2779879,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"actually see but okay this light then"},{"startMs":2783599,"durationMs":7410,"subtitle":"because it's their idea is that these"},{"startMs":2787799,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"massively heavy objects warp the fabric"},{"startMs":2791009,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"of space-time so you imagine it like a"},{"startMs":2793019,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"like a sheet and it bends the sheet and"},{"startMs":2795899,"durationMs":2491,"subtitle":"that causes the light will always travel"},{"startMs":2797759,"durationMs":2671,"subtitle":"in straight"},{"startMs":2798390,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"and in this case it has to actually"},{"startMs":2800430,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"follow that curvature so it follows it"},{"startMs":2802920,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"up and then back down which is what"},{"startMs":2805410,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"happens in a lens or lenses designed"},{"startMs":2806880,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"obviously to to bend the light and in"},{"startMs":2809580,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"bending the light you can you can"},{"startMs":2811080,"durationMs":4430,"subtitle":"magnify it and and do all sorts of"},{"startMs":2813270,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"clever things with with an image and"},{"startMs":2815510,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"their idea is that this object is"},{"startMs":2818190,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"bending this light and this light is"},{"startMs":2820350,"durationMs":5430,"subtitle":"becoming smert you smudged all across"},{"startMs":2823200,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"here and I kind of looked at it and this"},{"startMs":2825780,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"was they published this this is called"},{"startMs":2828240,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"the Twelve arc gravitationally lensed"},{"startMs":2831030,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"image and and it was a new image that"},{"startMs":2832830,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"they released and I thought for a bit of"},{"startMs":2835320,"durationMs":2910,"subtitle":"a laugh let's look at this image because"},{"startMs":2837060,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"I've never really believed in"},{"startMs":2838230,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"gravitational lensing and I kind of"},{"startMs":2842280,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"thought maybe I'll see something maybe"},{"startMs":2845250,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"you know I'll kind of look at and go"},{"startMs":2847290,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"yeah well maybe it is I can see it"},{"startMs":2849030,"durationMs":9450,"subtitle":"because they claim that this galaxy was"},{"startMs":2851850,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"reflect it was using the word reflective"},{"startMs":2858480,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"because it shouldn't be reflected but it"},{"startMs":2859770,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"appears in this warped image twelve"},{"startMs":2862380,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"times so the same galaxy that it that is"},{"startMs":2865260,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"far away is repeated twelve times in in"},{"startMs":2868500,"durationMs":5670,"subtitle":"this image and before we kind of go on"},{"startMs":2871830,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"it is important to sort of realize what"},{"startMs":2874170,"durationMs":6390,"subtitle":"a lens can actually do so when you look"},{"startMs":2877410,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"at lens images and a lens can invert the"},{"startMs":2880560,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"image in both planes simultaneously so"},{"startMs":2882990,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"when you look at it it will you know if"},{"startMs":2885000,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"you hold up a lens it will flip the"},{"startMs":2887610,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"image left to right and it will flip the"},{"startMs":2890130,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"image upside down so when you look at an"},{"startMs":2892080,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"image lens holder down in front of you"},{"startMs":2894030,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"the world is upside down and left is"},{"startMs":2896310,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"right and right is left now a perfect"},{"startMs":2899250,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"lens will only create one copy which is"},{"startMs":2901800,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"how you obviously magnifying glasses"},{"startMs":2904500,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"work and telescopes work etc etc"},{"startMs":2907280,"durationMs":5830,"subtitle":"multiple lenses could obviously create"},{"startMs":2910320,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"multiple copies and each one then"},{"startMs":2913110,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"repeats so if you have lots of them you"},{"startMs":2914640,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"would end up with lots of copies at"},{"startMs":2917190,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"change another thing to realize is that"},{"startMs":2920010,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"lens itself will change the shape of the"},{"startMs":2922560,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"object behind it'll warp and distort it"},{"startMs":2925850,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"and that's obviously probably what we"},{"startMs":2928770,"durationMs":3270,"subtitle":"see in some of these images one"},{"startMs":2930450,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"important point to note is"},{"startMs":2932040,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"Allen's cannot convert just one part of"},{"startMs":2934980,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"one plane like a mirror so when you"},{"startMs":2937830,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"reflect when you look in the mirror"},{"startMs":2939600,"durationMs":3570,"subtitle":"you're seeing a reflection which is only"},{"startMs":2941010,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"inverting one playing left to right when"},{"startMs":2943170,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"we look at a mirror but it could be up"},{"startMs":2944670,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"and down so when you're dealing with"},{"startMs":2946650,"durationMs":9410,"subtitle":"lenses you have to see both up and down"},{"startMs":2949140,"durationMs":12300,"subtitle":"and left and right so let's jump over to"},{"startMs":2956060,"durationMs":7750,"subtitle":"here so this is the image itself and if"},{"startMs":2961440,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"we zoom in on this image just that you"},{"startMs":2963810,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"you kind of get an idea so these the"},{"startMs":2966030,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"sort of red dots is what they claim this"},{"startMs":2968820,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"galaxy is and if you sort of scroll"},{"startMs":2970590,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"around you can see that sort of repeated"},{"startMs":2973920,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"a number of different times across this"},{"startMs":2976470,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"image and the interesting thing is there"},{"startMs":2979440,"durationMs":5430,"subtitle":"are other arcs in this image and again"},{"startMs":2982410,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"you see down here as well the same sort"},{"startMs":2984870,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"of dots and blue lines which I kind of"},{"startMs":2987210,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"looked and I was like yeah that I'd"},{"startMs":2989130,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"probably you could probably count this"},{"startMs":2991170,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"as twelve times but there are a few"},{"startMs":2992670,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"other artifacts the first thing that I"},{"startMs":2995280,"durationMs":6350,"subtitle":"think is quite important to note is that"},{"startMs":2998270,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"we see"},{"startMs":3003330,"durationMs":2180,"subtitle":"see"},{"startMs":3008390,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"you"},{"startMs":3011290,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"not"},{"startMs":3013829,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"okay we see let me destroy it if we look"},{"startMs":3017009,"durationMs":5911,"subtitle":"here we see that there are a number of"},{"startMs":3020509,"durationMs":3790,"subtitle":"circles that can be drawn now if you"},{"startMs":3022920,"durationMs":3389,"subtitle":"spend a long time you can actually get"},{"startMs":3024299,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"the perfect circle first thing to note"},{"startMs":3026309,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"is that this circle doesn't really match"},{"startMs":3028049,"durationMs":4651,"subtitle":"up with these lines over here and if we"},{"startMs":3030479,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"look at these lines they have sort of a"},{"startMs":3032700,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"different angle on them here and there"},{"startMs":3035119,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"we also know that there is a smaller one"},{"startMs":3037499,"durationMs":6270,"subtitle":"right here which sort of fits into that"},{"startMs":3042359,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"can you see that that bond on the bottom"},{"startMs":3043769,"durationMs":8401,"subtitle":"oh no you just you still got the lens"},{"startMs":3046049,"durationMs":8300,"subtitle":"two images on that screen oh oh do I"},{"startMs":3052170,"durationMs":2179,"subtitle":"have"},{"startMs":3055630,"durationMs":7170,"subtitle":"ladies and your attention please I think"},{"startMs":3059930,"durationMs":2870,"subtitle":"I have to go back to"},{"startMs":3064600,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"now oh yeah yeah for that if I share"},{"startMs":3067810,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"that one okay here we go"},{"startMs":3070570,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"yeah only just look at it so so yeah so"},{"startMs":3074290,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"when I was saying drawing these circles"},{"startMs":3076090,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"so if we draw if we look at the image we"},{"startMs":3078430,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"see well actually let's just go back to"},{"startMs":3082060,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"here if we start looking at the image so"},{"startMs":3084310,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"that the galaxy that they see are these"},{"startMs":3086410,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"dots here so if you look at this start"},{"startMs":3088300,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"that dark that that's what they claim is"},{"startMs":3090250,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"the galaxy which is repeated over 12"},{"startMs":3093820,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"times and it goes right down to here as"},{"startMs":3097570,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"well we see the same sort of thing and"},{"startMs":3099540,"durationMs":7690,"subtitle":"down here as well we see the interesting"},{"startMs":3103210,"durationMs":8610,"subtitle":"thing is we see other arcs in the image"},{"startMs":3107230,"durationMs":6510,"subtitle":"as well that may be related may not be"},{"startMs":3111820,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"related so the first thing that I think"},{"startMs":3113740,"durationMs":5990,"subtitle":"is quite interesting is is it does sort"},{"startMs":3116110,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"of form a circular pattern now"},{"startMs":3119730,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"I'm not going to spend too long getting"},{"startMs":3121930,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"it right because I did spend a long time"},{"startMs":3123490,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and I originally did this but notice"},{"startMs":3125860,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"that it's not a it's not a perfect"},{"startMs":3127570,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"circle and be that the opposite side"},{"startMs":3129850,"durationMs":4970,"subtitle":"doesn't match up with these lines down"},{"startMs":3132160,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"here they seem to have a different"},{"startMs":3134820,"durationMs":6370,"subtitle":"proton line up for that one down there a"},{"startMs":3137760,"durationMs":7090,"subtitle":"different sort of angle on them and also"},{"startMs":3141190,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"this one here the smaller one seems to"},{"startMs":3144850,"durationMs":5350,"subtitle":"be sort of a sub"},{"startMs":3147710,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"circle of the larger circle so there's"},{"startMs":3150200,"durationMs":4859,"subtitle":"like a bigger circle with some slight"},{"startMs":3153050,"durationMs":4850,"subtitle":"variations to it and then a smaller"},{"startMs":3155059,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"inner circle yeah can you see that and"},{"startMs":3157900,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"as I started to sort of study this image"},{"startMs":3160460,"durationMs":5430,"subtitle":"I kind of thought well okay if we start"},{"startMs":3163940,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"to study we do start to see sort of"},{"startMs":3165890,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"there are blue dots and there are red"},{"startMs":3168170,"durationMs":8130,"subtitle":"dots and my first sort of thought was"},{"startMs":3170420,"durationMs":8040,"subtitle":"well what if this is not because their"},{"startMs":3176300,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"idea is that these are galaxies well"},{"startMs":3178460,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"what if they're not galaxies I kind of"},{"startMs":3180470,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"thought to myself what if they are stars"},{"startMs":3182540,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"instead what would we sort of see if"},{"startMs":3185950,"durationMs":5990,"subtitle":"they were stars and when"},{"startMs":3188720,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"[Music]"},{"startMs":3192990,"durationMs":3530,"subtitle":"just delete that layer"},{"startMs":3197210,"durationMs":5410,"subtitle":"you"},{"startMs":3199000,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"it's reopen this"},{"startMs":3205420,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"you"},{"startMs":3207140,"durationMs":4370,"subtitle":"I will light stop turning off"},{"startMs":3212310,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"I just

you"},{"startMs":3240720,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"can see there are four dots that was the"},{"startMs":3243600,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"first thing that sort of drew my"},{"startMs":3244920,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"attention here there's sort of there's a"},{"startMs":3247410,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"certain pattern to them and when we look"},{"startMs":3249630,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"over here we see the same sort of"},{"startMs":3252690,"durationMs":6270,"subtitle":"pattern on this side but notice that it"},{"startMs":3255540,"durationMs":6870,"subtitle":"is the reflection of that side so I"},{"startMs":3258960,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"wonder to myself is it a reflection or"},{"startMs":3262410,"durationMs":3270,"subtitle":"is this because sometimes you can look"},{"startMs":3263760,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"at images and you can see anything you"},{"startMs":3265680,"durationMs":6410,"subtitle":"want so I took a slice of this so let's"},{"startMs":3269580,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"just do this here and now so that we can"},{"startMs":3272090,"durationMs":7090,"subtitle":"see what I saw let's paste this as this"},{"startMs":3275580,"durationMs":5810,"subtitle":"like a tutorial placed new layer so if"},{"startMs":3279180,"durationMs":2210,"subtitle":"we"},{"startMs":3281829,"durationMs":7650,"subtitle":"take this layer and if I move it mmm so"},{"startMs":3286509,"durationMs":6721,"subtitle":"that's a copy of what we see there and"},{"startMs":3289479,"durationMs":11221,"subtitle":"if I change the opacity

and"},{"startMs":3302710,"durationMs":6030,"subtitle":"the first thing you can notice is okay"},{"startMs":3305800,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"there are indeed the stars do sort of"},{"startMs":3308740,"durationMs":4589,"subtitle":"match up but one of the things that you"},{"startMs":3311140,"durationMs":6510,"subtitle":"can see is that it is much much much"},{"startMs":3313329,"durationMs":10081,"subtitle":"larger so what happens if we scale this"},{"startMs":3317650,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"image down so hold on first of all first"},{"startMs":3323410,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"of all this is a direct copy of this one"},{"startMs":3324970,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"right so the first thing we need to

be"},{"startMs":3343900,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"turned so let's just rotate this"},{"startMs":3355640,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"you"},{"startMs":3360400,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"you"},{"startMs":3364180,"durationMs":4210,"subtitle":"that's"},{"startMs":3366060,"durationMs":2330,"subtitle":"this

if"},{"startMs":3377029,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"I know we're done rotating if I just"},{"startMs":3379819,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"hold it over the top of it you can start"},{"startMs":3382939,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"to see that they sort of line up but"},{"startMs":3385059,"durationMs":6490,"subtitle":"it's a little bit too big so the next"},{"startMs":3389779,"durationMs":3871,"subtitle":"thing we do is just make it a little bit"},{"startMs":3391549,"durationMs":6950,"subtitle":"smaller"},{"startMs":3393650,"durationMs":4849,"subtitle":"oh that's"},{"startMs":3400059,"durationMs":5371,"subtitle":"and now when we line them up do you"},{"startMs":3402459,"durationMs":5540,"subtitle":"notice that those three stars align that"},{"startMs":3405430,"durationMs":7109,"subtitle":"star up there aligns that star there"},{"startMs":3407999,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"aligns and there is something up there"},{"startMs":3412539,"durationMs":4621,"subtitle":"but it's it's hard to see yeah and"},{"startMs":3415239,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"notice here the difference is that star"},{"startMs":3417160,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"that we copied from there is dipping"},{"startMs":3419349,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"down and what's interesting when we look"},{"startMs":3421479,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"up here is that actually what's"},{"startMs":3423219,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"happening is that the filament is"},{"startMs":3425319,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"curving upwards almost like it's sort

forms"},{"startMs":3432999,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"indeed aligns perfectly with that one"},{"startMs":3436059,"durationMs":3950,"subtitle":"now obviously I could have taken the two"},{"startMs":3438189,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"stars and that probably would have line"},{"startMs":3440009,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"would have also lined up with this star"},{"startMs":3442809,"durationMs":6930,"subtitle":"they're the same and and again I went"},{"startMs":3446589,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"into you can go crazy with this but the"},{"startMs":3449739,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"same actually happens when you look here"},{"startMs":3451959,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"so these although it doesn't look like"},{"startMs":3454119,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"these patterns actually appear here if"},{"startMs":3457059,"durationMs":5670,"subtitle":"we look here you see these two stars"},{"startMs":3459069,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"there those two stars appear here but"},{"startMs":3462729,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"what seems to be happening with this"},{"startMs":3464049,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"section is the bottom bit is sort of"},{"startMs":3466719,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"being squashed down so we're seeing some"},{"startMs":3470349,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"of these stars but not all of them at"},{"startMs":3472839,"durationMs":6030,"subtitle":"the bottom and again that red star"},{"startMs":3475059,"durationMs":6841,"subtitle":"appears and just to be really clear you"},{"startMs":3478869,"durationMs":6690,"subtitle":"cannot get a reflection with the

reflection"},{"startMs":3489090,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"so this doesn't make any sense this"},{"startMs":3490770,"durationMs":3510,"subtitle":"doesn't make any sense in terms of it"},{"startMs":3492330,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"being gravitationally lensed image at"},{"startMs":3494280,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"all and in fact when you start looking"},{"startMs":3496740,"durationMs":6030,"subtitle":"the same thing you can repeat the same"},{"startMs":3499020,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"thing over and over again and again here"},{"startMs":3502770,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"although if we take this slice and put"},{"startMs":3505110,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"it over here it doesn't initially look"},{"startMs":3507990,"durationMs":6339,"subtitle":"like a perfect match but again when we"},{"startMs":3511530,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"start to rotate this"},{"startMs":3514329,"durationMs":4831,"subtitle":"and we start to line it up you start to"},{"startMs":3517209,"durationMs":4351,"subtitle":"see that a lot of those stars that we"},{"startMs":3519160,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"looked at"},{"startMs":3521560,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"actually start to match up with the ones"},{"startMs":3523630,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"that we had before it's not perfect and"},{"startMs":3525880,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"in this case actually what we need to do"},{"startMs":3527800,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"is flip it again because that star is"},{"startMs":3530110,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"that star there so we have to flip it"},{"startMs":3532420,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"one more time and as I kept looking"},{"startMs":3534700,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"around the image you keep flipping the"},{"startMs":3537100,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"image and the same thing would appear"},{"startMs":3539500,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"now you're not seeing obviously here"},{"startMs":3541300,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"you're seeing less of the blue stars"},{"startMs":3543250,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"because something else is happening"},{"startMs":3544560,"durationMs":6730,"subtitle":"around the edge but another thing that"},{"startMs":3547930,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"caught my eye is if you look at the"},{"startMs":3551290,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"original one here you see these two and"},{"startMs":3554170,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"those two they form quite a unique sort"},{"startMs":3557380,"durationMs":6150,"subtitle":"of shape those there and again if we"},{"startMs":3560770,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"look down here we see that same shape"},{"startMs":3563530,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"appearing here now some of this may be"},{"startMs":3566560,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"coincidence and some of this may be you"},{"startMs":3569110,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"know you your eye is sort of designed to"},{"startMs":3571750,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"see patterns but without a doubt that"},{"startMs":3574240,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"first one that I found here this one two"},{"startMs":3576730,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"over there is absolutely a reflection"},{"startMs":3579940,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"from one side to the other and that that"},{"startMs":3583060,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"simply shouldn't happen so you know in"},{"startMs":3587620,"durationMs":3710,"subtitle":"my mind what is this what are we looking"},{"startMs":3589270,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"at what why would we see a reflection"},{"startMs":3591330,"durationMs":7450,"subtitle":"rather than a reflection and an"},{"startMs":3595360,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"inversion and I can only think of of one"},{"startMs":3598780,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"possible way that you could actually"},{"startMs":3600100,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"create that and imagine when we look at"},{"startMs":3603730,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"fiber optic cables you know we know you"},{"startMs":3605350,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"shine light down fiber optic cables

it"},{"startMs":3611110,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"reflects off the side of the glass the"},{"startMs":3614980,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"reason it reflects off the side of the"},{"startMs":3616510,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"glass is because it's a boundary there's"},{"startMs":3619030,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"a change in the in the optical density"},{"startMs":3621130,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"of the media which means that you you"},{"startMs":3623380,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"have total internal reflections for the"},{"startMs":3625150,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"light will hit it and reflect off it"},{"startMs":3627280,"durationMs":3630,"subtitle":"which is why when you look at a glass"},{"startMs":3629350,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"window you you will also see a"},{"startMs":3630910,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"reflection as well as being able to see"},{"startMs":3632650,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"through it because there's a boundary so"},{"startMs":3635470,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"my my theory is that this is a boundary"},{"startMs":3638740,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"layer that we're looking at so this is a"},{"startMs":3640570,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"boundary potentially of one of

is"},{"startMs":3647050,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"simply a stellar one I don't know"},{"startMs":3649120,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"because what would happen is the light"},{"startMs":3651430,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"that would be traveling through it would"},{"startMs":3654340,"durationMs":3330,"subtitle":"obviously"},{"startMs":3655150,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"reflecting off it now why is it that we"},{"startMs":3657670,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"see this because in theory shouldn't we"},{"startMs":3660460,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"see them everywhere you know if there"},{"startMs":3663010,"durationMs":5750,"subtitle":"are all these filaments that connected"},{"startMs":3664900,"durationMs":6750,"subtitle":"so my idea is that something is broken"},{"startMs":3668760,"durationMs":4990,"subtitle":"along this filament so the only reason"},{"startMs":3671650,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"you would see it imagine when you look"},{"startMs":3673750,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"at a fiber-optic cable so that is that"},{"startMs":3677410,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"it's got light in it normally you don't"},{"startMs":3679480,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"see the light very little of the light"},{"startMs":3681820,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"actually escapes but if you break that"},{"startMs":3684900,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"fiber-optic cable or you scratch it it"},{"startMs":3687670,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"will start to meet much much much more"},{"startMs":3689920,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"light so and the fact that we see this"},{"startMs":3692710,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"is not a smooth but a very sort of"},{"startMs":3694840,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"rugged in my mind suggests that"},{"startMs":3697570,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"something has gone on that has changed"},{"startMs":3699370,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"the boundary condition of the the"},{"startMs":3702430,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"berkland current and is causing the"},{"startMs":3705430,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"light to escape very much like looking"},{"startMs":3708640,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"at a fiber optic cable normally you"},{"startMs":3710590,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"wouldn't see it but you're seeing it"},{"startMs":3712330,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"here because something has occurred

older"},{"startMs":3730480,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"ones that we look at are are not as"},{"startMs":3732460,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"clear so it is a lot harder to see it"},{"startMs":3734440,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"but even here when you start to look at"},{"startMs":3736840,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"it you see if you will start looking at"},{"startMs":3738220,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"this shape I see the same shape here so"},{"startMs":3741220,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"you start to see the fact that some of"},{"startMs":3742810,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"these and look at the gap spacing"},{"startMs":3745210,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"between this and this there's a

it"},{"startMs":3754900,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"that it would match that that doesn't"},{"startMs":3756910,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"necessarily prove that it is what we're"},{"startMs":3760240,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"talking about but again in this case"},{"startMs":3761650,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"here it is a very clear reflection"},{"startMs":3764020,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"because that's the blue side that's the"},{"startMs":3765790,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"blue side and then you've got the pink"},{"startMs":3768010,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"side on the other side so this would be"},{"startMs":3770050,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"another example of one of

these"},{"startMs":3773350,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"boundaries"},{"startMs":3775109,"durationMs":3781,"subtitle":"and again what I find interesting about"},{"startMs":3776910,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"a lot of these images and here as well"},{"startMs":3778890,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"this to me looks when I look at this

I"},{"startMs":3800549,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"personally think that we need to look at"},{"startMs":3802289,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"all these things with with open eyes

in"},{"startMs":3816869,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"my mind like fiber-optic cables which"},{"startMs":3818880,"durationMs":7790,"subtitle":"are sort of being scratched and again"},{"startMs":3823529,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"here is another image with this is a"},{"startMs":3826670,"durationMs":6069,"subtitle":"slightly weirder one because you can

the"},{"startMs":3840299,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"orange of whatever this object is that"},{"startMs":3843089,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"is sort of being repeated which

up"},{"startMs":3856049,"durationMs":7891,"subtitle":"here as well these galaxies themselves"},{"startMs":3859890,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"blue lines again and here again we
