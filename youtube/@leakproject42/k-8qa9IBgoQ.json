they"},{"startMs":364150,"durationMs":4949,"subtitle":"now have 50 years to do it"},{"startMs":365770,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"so the idea is to have 50 years

trying"},{"startMs":384970,"durationMs":4949,"subtitle":"to get probes you know interstellar"},{"startMs":388120,"durationMs":4169,"subtitle":"distances so the idea is to take"},{"startMs":389919,"durationMs":4951,"subtitle":"something like a probe the size of a"},{"startMs":392289,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"cell phone a small probe with a

in"},{"startMs":417670,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"erupt I was just saying that's a bold"},{"startMs":418960,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"statement I mean 20 20 years that kind"},{"startMs":421960,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"of speed that's incredible"},{"startMs":423340,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"now that would be incredible right

what"},{"startMs":435340,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"if it's speken vomit dust hits it then"},{"startMs":438160,"durationMs":8790,"subtitle":"what yeah yes so the idea is to send"},{"startMs":443980,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"multiple probes this way to have a whole"},{"startMs":446950,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"fleet of probes flying out so

back"},{"startMs":846589,"durationMs":3031,"subtitle":"to what you did with NASA with the"},{"startMs":847850,"durationMs":4409,"subtitle":"autonomous system so you're working

next"},{"startMs":858230,"durationMs":3149,"subtitle":"one there's there's different techniques"},{"startMs":859910,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"and so deep learning is a newer"},{"startMs":861379,"durationMs":5101,"subtitle":"technique yeah okay now now what is your"},{"startMs":864500,"durationMs":3809,"subtitle":"take artificial intelligence I mean how"},{"startMs":866480,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"far do you think it's gonna go and how"},{"startMs":868309,"durationMs":6481,"subtitle":"advanced and how quickly that's a very"},{"startMs":871519,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"general question and it's you know"},{"startMs":874790,"durationMs":5969,"subtitle":"there's many different applications for"},{"startMs":878379,"durationMs":5411,"subtitle":"artificial intelligence and so I think"},{"startMs":880759,"durationMs":6841,"subtitle":"it's going to be you know how far each"},{"startMs":883790,"durationMs":7169,"subtitle":"of these different applications can be"},{"startMs":887600,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"pushed is going to vary you know and so"},{"startMs":890959,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"it's so it's hard to say in general how"},{"startMs":892790,"durationMs":8519,"subtitle":"far this will go we use machine learning"},{"startMs":896779,"durationMs":7771,"subtitle":"for data analysis at this point I do"},{"startMs":901309,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"work on characterizing exoplanets and so"},{"startMs":904550,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"machine learning is pretty central to"},{"startMs":906139,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"that great so that's a perfect platform"},{"startMs":909889,"durationMs":4591,"subtitle":"well let's take it there I think that's"},{"startMs":911839,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"that's a place I'd really like to just a"},{"startMs":914480,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"place of discussion I'd like to get into"},{"startMs":916040,"durationMs":2370,"subtitle":"so all these new exoplanets that

right"},{"startMs":920540,"durationMs":5219,"subtitle":"yeah right that's what I'm talking about"},{"startMs":923809,"durationMs":3030,"subtitle":"I mean that just changes things up a"},{"startMs":925759,"durationMs":2611,"subtitle":"little bit you know I remember growing"},{"startMs":926839,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"up it's like no there's only you know"},{"startMs":928370,"durationMs":3329,"subtitle":"there's only seven planets Rex there are"},{"startMs":930529,"durationMs":3341,"subtitle":"there characteristics where these"},{"startMs":931699,"durationMs":3941,"subtitle":"planets are being discovered I mean"},{"startMs":933870,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"are there similar to the patterns or is"},{"startMs":935640,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"it sporadic let's talk about that now"},{"startMs":938580,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"that's a good question first one of the"},{"startMs":941660,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"one of them yeah the more recent"},{"startMs":945140,"durationMs":3190,"subtitle":"emissions that was has been really"},{"startMs":947160,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"important was the Kepler space telescope"},{"startMs":948330,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"and so that Kepler space telescope was"},{"startMs":951480,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"put into orbit and I don't know sometime"},{"startMs":954420,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"in the early in the mid-2000s and

at"},{"startMs":984570,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"arm's length this is about the size of"},{"startMs":986580,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"the patch that Kepler was watching

so"},{"startMs":1039589,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"there is some kind of selection bias"},{"startMs":1040819,"durationMs":7860,"subtitle":"because we are mainly detecting

a"},{"startMs":1636639,"durationMs":4441,"subtitle":"point where the star will look like it's"},{"startMs":1638559,"durationMs":6181,"subtitle":"starting to set like you've got

eventually"},{"startMs":1650769,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"you get the night zone on the back and"},{"startMs":1652679,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"so it turns out that these planets you"},{"startMs":1656590,"durationMs":3689,"subtitle":"know when you think of Earth you think"},{"startMs":1658059,"durationMs":3391,"subtitle":"of half of its led half of its dark

and"},{"startMs":1721139,"durationMs":5981,"subtitle":"improve the quality of our results yeah"},{"startMs":1724750,"durationMs":4679,"subtitle":"and these planets how is there a size"},{"startMs":1727120,"durationMs":4289,"subtitle":"that most of them kind of categorize as"},{"startMs":1729429,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"or they typically bigger than Earth

are"},{"startMs":1747030,"durationMs":8530,"subtitle":"quite different than things we have in"},{"startMs":1750010,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"our solar system so one example is we"},{"startMs":1755560,"durationMs":7230,"subtitle":"have we've detected what we call mini"},{"startMs":1758290,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"mini gas planets so these are like

two"},{"startMs":1768220,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"times the radius of Earth so once you"},{"startMs":1770140,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"get a little bit bigger than twice

you"},{"startMs":2931870,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"one day"},{"startMs":2933220,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"so disclosure would prove you know

that"},{"startMs":2955390,"durationMs":5350,"subtitle":"intelligent life from somewhere else has"},{"startMs":2957710,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"visited earth right so that would be

don't"},{"startMs":2965900,"durationMs":10350,"subtitle":"know I would like to have more data I"},{"startMs":2970240,"durationMs":10990,"subtitle":"have a given especially now that

say"},{"startMs":2983029,"durationMs":5961,"subtitle":"look we have a problem and they went to"},{"startMs":2986299,"durationMs":6770,"subtitle":"Congress and said we have a problem

they"},{"startMs":3014170,"durationMs":4589,"subtitle":"basically did is went to Congress and"},{"startMs":3015789,"durationMs":5341,"subtitle":"say by the way there's something that we"},{"startMs":3018759,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"can't possibly protect you from you"},{"startMs":3021130,"durationMs":4979,"subtitle":"don't know what it is that's what

real"},{"startMs":3027849,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"problem out there and so the question is"},{"startMs":3031839,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"what is that problem in what what are"},{"startMs":3033759,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"these objects you know that they're"},{"startMs":3035500,"durationMs":5549,"subtitle":"encountering and that I would like to"},{"startMs":3039400,"durationMs":6899,"subtitle":"understand and that I think is gonna"},{"startMs":3041049,"durationMs":8851,"subtitle":"take careful study yeah and the you also"},{"startMs":3046299,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"study quantum mechanics mm-hmm yeah I"},{"startMs":3049900,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"also do some theoretical work in quantum"},{"startMs":3052029,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"mechanics and foundational physics is"},{"startMs":3055000,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"quantum mechanics and foundational"},{"startMs":3056829,"durationMs":6710,"subtitle":"physics is that essentially quantum"},{"startMs":3058839,"durationMs":8011,"subtitle":"physics yeah okay you know physics here"},{"startMs":3063539,"durationMs":6071,"subtitle":"with quantum physics the more I"},{"startMs":3066850,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"research it seems more fast and like"},{"startMs":3069610,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"just the less I know and it does seem to"},{"startMs":3072160,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"be like a simulation almost in nature"},{"startMs":3074860,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"simulate an holographic in nature would"},{"startMs":3077740,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"you agree with that with the research"},{"startMs":3079900,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"you've done or would you would you"},{"startMs":3081520,"durationMs":9350,"subtitle":"disagree quantum mechanics is weird and"},{"startMs":3086230,"durationMs":8220,"subtitle":"that's my profession it is we perfect"},{"startMs":3090870,"durationMs":6910,"subtitle":"it's weird the universe is not the way"},{"startMs":3094450,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"we think it is I think that's pretty"},{"startMs":3097780,"durationMs":9570,"subtitle":"clear"},{"startMs":3098430,"durationMs":11560,"subtitle":"and the it gets to be a bit difficult"},{"startMs":3107350,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"because there are some aspects of"},{"startMs":3109990,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"quantum mechanics that are strange and"},{"startMs":3112000,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"then there are some aspects that are"},{"startMs":3114520,"durationMs":8730,"subtitle":"kind of hyped up when presented to the"},{"startMs":3118000,"durationMs":8430,"subtitle":"public and and that that maybe are a bit"},{"startMs":3123250,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"too hyped and I and I sometimes cringe"},{"startMs":3126430,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"when I see things in the popular press"},{"startMs":3128410,"durationMs":5430,"subtitle":"about you know this aspect of in quantum"},{"startMs":3131260,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"entanglement am like oh that's not quite"},{"startMs":3133840,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"how it works that's not really what"},{"startMs":3136030,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"happens or you know or the whole"},{"startMs":3139720,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"holographic aspects I think when

my"},{"startMs":3157990,"durationMs":4310,"subtitle":"only hope that's not what the quantum"},{"startMs":3160780,"durationMs":4490,"subtitle":"physicist means when they say"},{"startMs":3162300,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"holographic so so I think there's some"},{"startMs":3165270,"durationMs":7780,"subtitle":"difficulties there presenting this to"},{"startMs":3168400,"durationMs":9690,"subtitle":"the public but but I at the same time"},{"startMs":3173050,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"yes it is weird no what could you tell"},{"startMs":3178090,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"me about it that has fascinated you that"},{"startMs":3180850,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"you would like to see more research done"},{"startMs":3182530,"durationMs":5570,"subtitle":"on it just takes you to the next level"},{"startMs":3184930,"durationMs":3170,"subtitle":"like you said makes it weird"},{"startMs":3194710,"durationMs":10030,"subtitle":"it's difficult maybe the problem of"},{"startMs":3202160,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"entanglement is a strange is is is a"},{"startMs":3204740,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"good example perhaps and I'm trying to"},{"startMs":3206750,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"think of one that's gonna be people are"},{"startMs":3208400,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"gonna be familiar with yeah thank you so"},{"startMs":3210440,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"this is one of entanglement something"},{"startMs":3212780,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"that you've heard of that you'll"},{"startMs":3214100,"durationMs":9300,"subtitle":"probably be familiar with so you can"},{"startMs":3216680,"durationMs":9720,"subtitle":"have a so let's say I you know create"},{"startMs":3223400,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"take a camera banging into something and"},{"startMs":3226400,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"create two two electrons that go flying"},{"startMs":3228650,"durationMs":5930,"subtitle":"off in different directions then"},{"startMs":3230990,"durationMs":3590,"subtitle":"electrons have a property called spin"},{"startMs":3234850,"durationMs":5590,"subtitle":"kind of acts it isn't they aren't really"},{"startMs":3237890,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"spinning but they act they have they act"},{"startMs":3240440,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"as if they're spinning in some sense"},{"startMs":3242090,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"right so so these two electrons that go"},{"startMs":3245150,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"flying off the their spins have to be"},{"startMs":3247580,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"opposite each other so one spinning has"},{"startMs":3249950,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"a spin that we call up and the other has"},{"startMs":3251840,"durationMs":10770,"subtitle":"a spin we call down and they go flying"},{"startMs":3254600,"durationMs":10260,"subtitle":"off and so the entanglement is a bit"},{"startMs":3262610,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"strange because what what it means is"},{"startMs":3264860,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"that if I I perform an experiment on one"},{"startMs":3267590,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"of those two electrons then immediately"},{"startMs":3270260,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"I know what the other other electrons"},{"startMs":3272330,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"doing though no some in some sense that"},{"startMs":3274940,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"isn't that surprising because if I"},{"startMs":3276710,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"measure spin down here well I know the"},{"startMs":3279020,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"other one has to be spin up so at one"},{"startMs":3281510,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"level that's not so surprising however"},{"startMs":3285500,"durationMs":6870,"subtitle":"you can then you can do different"},{"startMs":3289790,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"experiments where where I don't exactly"},{"startMs":3292370,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"know what the answer is going to be so I"},{"startMs":3293990,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"can measure how much is the spin is"},{"startMs":3295580,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"pointing this way instead of or up or"},{"startMs":3297170,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"down and and if I do that if I measure"},{"startMs":3300500,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"this electron and then you measure the"},{"startMs":3303290,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"other one you'll get the opposite answer"},{"startMs":3305090,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"even though I couldn't have predicted"},{"startMs":3307100,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"which way this would have this one would"},{"startMs":3309050,"durationMs":8730,"subtitle":"have gone so so that aspect is a bit"},{"startMs":3313960,"durationMs":7950,"subtitle":"confusing it's not it's not what we're"},{"startMs":3317780,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"used to now"},{"startMs":3321910,"durationMs":6630,"subtitle":"in the in the popular press it's always"},{"startMs":3326500,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"so often talked about that you can
