one"},{"startMs":410639,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and this is in live science man this is"},{"startMs":412720,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"live science monolith object of mars you"},{"startMs":414639,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"could call it that they're gonna say"},{"startMs":415919,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"it's swamp gas from uranus that

on"},{"startMs":424400,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"phobos looks an awful lot like that too"},{"startMs":426960,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"the other picture that we don't have"},{"startMs":429280,"durationMs":5759,"subtitle":"it looks a whole lot more more it's more"},{"startMs":431360,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"square like that than uh"},{"startMs":435199,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"than the other one"},{"startMs":436720,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"yeah"},{"startMs":437599,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"yes so it's yeah that's

on"},{"startMs":451280,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"phobos and it's a lot it looks more"},{"startMs":453840,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"rectangular than than you see in this"},{"startMs":455840,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"boat"},{"startMs":457120,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"yeah yeah it's really interesting and"},{"startMs":459520,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"then"},{"startMs":460319,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"when we look at phobos itself"},{"startMs":463759,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"it is i mean"},{"startMs":466479,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"very bizarre it looks like it's got this"},{"startMs":468479,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"indentation"},{"startMs":470240,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and that's"},{"startMs":471680,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"yeah it's they've actually it's they did"},{"startMs":474240,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"its density you can estimate an object's"},{"startMs":476479,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"density by you know looking at its"},{"startMs":478560,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"orbital characteristics"},{"startMs":480560,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and all those lines it's the thing is"},{"startMs":482800,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"it's it's got voids on the inside of it"},{"startMs":485360,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"oh okay so they don't i don't know"},{"startMs":487120,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"whether that so so it's less it weighs"},{"startMs":489039,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"way less than than it should"},{"startMs":491360,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and that's because those cracks they"},{"startMs":493120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"think that there's just the whole moon"},{"startMs":494720,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"is just barely holding together because"},{"startMs":496720,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"that big old one impact on the one side"},{"startMs":499280,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"yeah and so it's got voids in there yes"},{"startMs":502319,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"you see the cracks"},{"startMs":504479,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"so it's it's probably if you went there"},{"startMs":506560,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"you could probably"},{"startMs":508080,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"if there isn't voids totally you could"},{"startMs":510240,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"easily mine"},{"startMs":511599,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"mine open voids"},{"startMs":513519,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and you notice all those cracks are like"},{"startMs":515440,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"parallel with the uh the impact"},{"startMs":517839,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"so it's just it's full of voids and rock"},{"startMs":520159,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"and dust so it's that's uh"},{"startMs":522640,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"it's ready to go for uh i mean if you're"},{"startMs":524880,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"going to set up a"},{"startMs":526320,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"orbital platform around mars that would"},{"startMs":528320,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"probably be the weird place to go"},{"startMs":531279,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"do you think it's an arc i mean do you"},{"startMs":532720,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"think it's an actual"},{"startMs":534399,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"well we know it's less dense than it"},{"startMs":536000,"durationMs":3610,"subtitle":"should be so there's voids inside of it"},{"startMs":538160,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"it looks pretty battered so"},{"startMs":539610,"durationMs":3110,"subtitle":"[Music]"},{"startMs":541360,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"whether or not there's anything inside"},{"startMs":542720,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"of it but we knew judo if you went there"},{"startMs":544720,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"you could probably easily if there isn't"},{"startMs":546800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"a if there isn't a space inside of it"},{"startMs":549440,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"because of its structure you could"},{"startMs":550800,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"easily"},{"startMs":552000,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"build a space inside of it"},{"startMs":555200,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"because there's there's definitely voids"},{"startMs":557120,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"inside of uh that moon"},{"startMs":559839,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"so you're looking at this right here and"},{"startMs":561600,"durationMs":5919,"subtitle":"you see it says that these grooves"},{"startMs":564320,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"could be produced by tidal forces"},{"startMs":567519,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"well it's probably more by the impact"},{"startMs":569279,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"that big old giant impact crater on the"},{"startMs":570880,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"one side of it yeah just split that"},{"startMs":573120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"sucker apart so it's just it's totally"},{"startMs":575519,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"shattered on the inside so you can"},{"startMs":576720,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"easily excavate"},{"startMs":578560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"do you think it could be like electrical"},{"startMs":580880,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"arcing from

asteroids"},{"startMs":592959,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"they're they're we're not quite sure"},{"startMs":594399,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"which at par which type of asteroid they"},{"startMs":596240,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"are but you know that that somehow they"},{"startMs":598880,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"got captured in mars orbit"},{"startMs":602160,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"versus uh phobos and deimos deimos is"},{"startMs":605200,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"actually de-orbiting so eventually it's"},{"startMs":607040,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"going to slam into the planet"},{"startMs":609839,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"because if it's if it's uh yeah so"},{"startMs":612720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"because it"},{"startMs":613839,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"so it's actually losing energy to mars"},{"startMs":616320,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and eventually slamming the planet"},{"startMs":618079,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"unless somebody fixes it but"},{"startMs":619920,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"those are ideal platforms but that yeah"},{"startMs":621680,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that monolith on uh phobos is really"},{"startMs":623680,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"unique and then what's really what"},{"startMs":625760,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"really set it off is that russian"},{"startMs":627040,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"spacecraft do you have that last picture"},{"startMs":629040,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"of the russian spacecraft"},{"startMs":631040,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"i do and this is the phobos 2"},{"startMs":634240,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"which was from the last photo from this"},{"startMs":636640,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"spacecraft that was launched by the"},{"startMs":638640,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"soviet union in 1989 january of 1989"},{"startMs":642880,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"um or actually this is when i think it"},{"startMs":644880,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"actually reached the location"},{"startMs":646800,"durationMs":6159,"subtitle":"it took some images of phobos"},{"startMs":650480,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"and then it disappeared"},{"startMs":652959,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"yeah it was supposed to go within 50"},{"startMs":654959,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"meters and that's the last thing they"},{"startMs":656720,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"saw"},{"startMs":657680,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you see that white thing down below"},{"startMs":659680,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"that's weird"},{"startMs":661920,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"well that is that's that's a fast moving"},{"startMs":664480,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"object"},{"startMs":666079,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"so we see it and we see it as a uh as a"},{"startMs":669040,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"long like white thing"},{"startMs":671040,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"but in actuality because you know you"},{"startMs":672720,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"know how things blur out if they're"},{"startMs":673839,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"moving fast yeah so that was probably we"},{"startMs":676399,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"don't know it could have been a sphere"},{"startMs":678240,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"could have been a little"},{"startMs":680000,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"squared looking thing but it's it's"},{"startMs":682720,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"actually just like the blurred out"},{"startMs":684720,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"vision of some very high speed moving"},{"startMs":687760,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"object"},{"startMs":690240,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"and at that speed in color it's probably"},{"startMs":692560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"we don't you know it's probably or it"},{"startMs":694079,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"could be artificial something you know"},{"startMs":696000,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"it came to that"},{"startMs":698000,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"this mars craft because it's you can see"},{"startMs":700160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"that that's a moving that's a really"},{"startMs":701519,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"fast moving object and that was the last"},{"startMs":704000,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"picture that um we don't even know"},{"startMs":706320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"exactly we know it was probably it was"},{"startMs":707839,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"moving fast and probably in the towards"},{"startMs":710399,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"the directions of the mars probe and"},{"startMs":712880,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"then that was the last picture that uh"},{"startMs":714800,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"the mars probe took"},{"startMs":717760,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"and we know it didn't impact on phobos"},{"startMs":720240,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"because we would have seen the impact"},{"startMs":721519,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"crater"},{"startMs":722480,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"if from the russian spacecraft so"},{"startMs":724880,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"it's whatever that object is that we see"},{"startMs":728079,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"there"},{"startMs":729200,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"disable the russian spacecraft"},{"startMs":731680,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you know"},{"startMs":732560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"if there was a betting line on this with"},{"startMs":734880,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"like draftkings or something like that i"},{"startMs":737120,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"would bet that this is a martian"},{"startMs":739839,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"craft"},{"startMs":741600,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"for somebody"},{"startMs":742880,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"because it's it's moving at such a high"},{"startMs":744320,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"rate of speed because you can see that"},{"startMs":745839,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"you know the phobos itself isn't moving"},{"startMs":748320,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"very much"},{"startMs":749440,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and uh so that is and so that object"},{"startMs":752240,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"there is moving like an extremely high"},{"startMs":754720,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"rate of speed"},{"startMs":756240,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"extremely high rate that get told that's"},{"startMs":759040,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"a martian craft man that's"},{"startMs":761360,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"that's the uh the people"},{"startMs":764000,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"we don't know whether it uh"},{"startMs":765839,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"it"},{"startMs":766800,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"was sent to intercept"},{"startMs":769120,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"you know the russian spacecraft or the"},{"startMs":771360,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"russian spacecraft just accidentally"},{"startMs":773760,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"kind of ran into it or gotta hear it no"},{"startMs":778240,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":779680,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you just don't know"},{"startMs":781120,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"i agree with you on the first statement"},{"startMs":782880,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"this was intercepted they they took this"},{"startMs":784880,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"there to stop this craft from getting"},{"startMs":786880,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"any closer to phobos yeah because it was"},{"startMs":789040,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"gonna get it was gonna go within 50 feet"},{"startMs":790959,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"of phobos and take some really close-up"},{"startMs":792720,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"pictures"},{"startMs":793680,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"i think it was going to take close-up"},{"startMs":795120,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"pictures of the model"},{"startMs":798079,"durationMs":8081,"subtitle":"so there's a freaking monolith on phobos"},{"startMs":801279,"durationMs":7201,"subtitle":"it's been admitted it's probably ancient"},{"startMs":806160,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"i mean it's probably thousands of years"},{"startMs":808480,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"old"},{"startMs":809440,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":810240,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"most likely an advanced civilization"},{"startMs":812720,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"that was on mars they're expanding and"},{"startMs":816320,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"then this major cataclysmic event"},{"startMs":818320,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"happens and it wipes out civilization"},{"startMs":822320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"as they knew it"},{"startMs":824480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and whatever was there mars probably"},{"startMs":826399,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"could never have had a civilization but"},{"startMs":828000,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"it could have had uh bases on it it just"},{"startMs":830959,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"it just froze it's too small see mars is"},{"startMs":833680,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"only 15 the mass of the earth and it"},{"startMs":836160,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"just throws up inside and i mean the"},{"startMs":838639,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"reason we keep"},{"startMs":840399,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"our inside our planet going is because"},{"startMs":843040,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"we actually have the moon if we didn't"},{"startMs":844320,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"have the moon we wouldn't even be around"},{"startMs":846480,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"because the moon pulls the inner core of"},{"startMs":848320,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"the earth off center and because the"},{"startMs":850639,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"earth rotates faster than the moon"},{"startMs":852320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"orbits it causes the inner core of the"},{"startMs":854560,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"earth to rotate faster than the rest of"},{"startMs":856399,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"the planet and that's actually where the"},{"startMs":858399,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"heat and uh and"},{"startMs":860800,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":861600,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"energy that runs the magnetic field of"},{"startMs":863680,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"the earth comes from and all the heat"},{"startMs":865600,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"that you know keeps the volcanoes going"},{"startMs":867120,"durationMs":2399,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":867920,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"the continental drift is actually caused"},{"startMs":869519,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"by the moon pulling the inner core of"},{"startMs":870880,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"the earth off that's what my master's"},{"startMs":873040,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"thesis was on the retention of magnetic"},{"startMs":875760,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"fields in close"},{"startMs":877199,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"orbiting and yeah"},{"startMs":880320,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"rocky terrestrial close orbiting planets"},{"startMs":881920,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":883839,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"theory so so that's actually how the uh"},{"startMs":886320,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"how the earthquake maintained and they"},{"startMs":887760,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"just came up with this uh yeah"},{"startMs":889600,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"some more backing on that yeah see that"},{"startMs":891680,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"was really strange that you know we got"},{"startMs":893600,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"they got that one picture"},{"startMs":895920,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"yeah the last image so weird"},{"startMs":899120,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"i mean it looks like a a fast"},{"startMs":901600,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"rod shaped ufo that has you know"},{"startMs":904399,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"or or it could be or it could be a"},{"startMs":906079,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"spherical one that's just stretched out"},{"startMs":908240,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"because because you know the camera"},{"startMs":909440,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"takes a while to take the picture yeah"},{"startMs":911680,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and so you get that you get that blur"},{"startMs":913680,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you've seen it in your own pictures or"},{"startMs":915120,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"other people right if something's moving"},{"startMs":916880,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"really really fast it leaves like a"},{"startMs":918240,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"streak"},{"startMs":919360,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"true"},{"startMs":920240,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"rather than a uh rather than a yeah like"},{"startMs":922480,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"that there it is so it left the street"},{"startMs":924399,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"it's highly reflective of a"},{"startMs":926639,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"fast-moving object"},{"startMs":929199,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"and then"},{"startMs":930720,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":931839,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"like listen to this shortly before the"},{"startMs":933600,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"final phase of the mission during which"},{"startMs":934959,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"the spacecraft was to approach within 50"},{"startMs":936880,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"meters of fobo surface and release two"},{"startMs":938720,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"landers one a mobile hopper oh it's"},{"startMs":940320,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"gonna drop landers on phobos no wonder"},{"startMs":943519,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"they were gonna actually go they're"},{"startMs":945199,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"gonna drop some little remote controls"},{"startMs":946720,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"on there the mission ended when the"},{"startMs":948399,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"spacecraft signal failed to be"},{"startMs":949920,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"successfully reached on"},{"startMs":951600,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"of course"},{"startMs":952959,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"the 27th"},{"startMs":954560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"of march 1989 the cause of failure was"},{"startMs":957279,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"determined to be malfunction of the"},{"startMs":959120,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"on-board computer which was probably"},{"startMs":961839,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"caused by this craft dude i mean this is"},{"startMs":964399,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"yes it is the anniversary of that by the"},{"startMs":966240,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"way for"},{"startMs":967600,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"because it is oh no is it march is that"},{"startMs":969600,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"may"},{"startMs":971279,"durationMs":1761,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":972240,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":973040,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"yeah no it's yeah no it's not it's not"},{"startMs":974880,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"me okay well anyway yeah that's so yeah"},{"startMs":977440,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"it how how why would it fail right"},{"startMs":980160,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"they've been working all that time until"},{"startMs":983680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"until uh and it was moving pretty slow"},{"startMs":985680,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"relative to phobos"},{"startMs":987360,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"so it could drop off a lander yeah"},{"startMs":990480,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":991360,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"oh look at these images"},{"startMs":993680,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"exactly what were they looking for and"},{"startMs":996880,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"then i think to myself the date"},{"startMs":999920,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"march"},{"startMs":1001199,"durationMs":2721,"subtitle":"what's in march"},{"startMs":1004240,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"mars mar"},{"startMs":1006160,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"march 27th i mean wow"},{"startMs":1010560,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"the numerology there and the"},{"startMs":1012160,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"significance of the astro the astrology"},{"startMs":1015680,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"yeah because because"},{"startMs":1017360,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"because the spacecraft had already"},{"startMs":1018880,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"passed by phobos i believe it was in"},{"startMs":1020639,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"orbit with"},{"startMs":1022000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"the moon around uh mars i think it had"},{"startMs":1024559,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"passed by a couple of times"},{"startMs":1026400,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and this was the uh final approach in"},{"startMs":1028400,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"which he was going to drop the uh the"},{"startMs":1030160,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"landers"},{"startMs":1031679,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"so it already been by phobos like taking"},{"startMs":1034959,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"pictures and decide where they're going"},{"startMs":1036240,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"to drop the lander and then they were"},{"startMs":1038000,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"coming by to drop the lander on phobos"},{"startMs":1040079,"durationMs":2401,"subtitle":"and that's when"},{"startMs":1041520,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"the uh"},{"startMs":1042480,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the soviet spacecraft got destroyed"},{"startMs":1045439,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"i mean look at this i'll bet you at one"},{"startMs":1047280,"durationMs":4990,"subtitle":"point this was this is an opening ken"},{"startMs":1049840,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"this is where the ships go in it's like"},{"startMs":1052270,"durationMs":3090,"subtitle":"[Music]"},{"startMs":1053640,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"[Laughter]"},{"startMs":1055360,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"what's interesting is uh"},{"startMs":1057440,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"is that these these moons because"},{"startMs":1059200,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"they're gravity locked gravitationally"},{"startMs":1061280,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"locked mars"},{"startMs":1062640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"they always keep one you know faces"},{"startMs":1065039,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"always facing mars"},{"startMs":1066640,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"and so if you put your if you landed you"},{"startMs":1068960,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"put a space station"},{"startMs":1070559,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"on the side facing mars it would protect"},{"startMs":1073280,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"you because mars so it would protect you"},{"startMs":1075360,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"from uh cosmic radiation"},{"startMs":1078559,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"so and so that's actually where you want"},{"startMs":1080640,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"to put a space uh uh like an orbital"},{"startMs":1082880,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"space platform is right on the the side"},{"startMs":1085360,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"facing mars because all almost all the"},{"startMs":1088480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"uh cosmic radiation"},{"startMs":1090640,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"obviously mars would protect you from"},{"startMs":1092000,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"cosmic radiation from that direction and"},{"startMs":1094000,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"then the rest of the moon would protect"},{"startMs":1095440,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"you from cosmic radiation coming from"},{"startMs":1097600,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"most of the other directions so it would"},{"startMs":1099360,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"be like the ideal place to put a uh"},{"startMs":1101679,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"to put a uh orbital platform around mars"},{"startMs":1104559,"durationMs":4881,"subtitle":"if you hit if you didn't want to get"},{"startMs":1106240,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"damaged by

i"},{"startMs":1114720,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"is occam's razor saying it's more likely"},{"startMs":1116799,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"this at one time was whatever that was"},{"startMs":1119039,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that it ran into i mean that object we"},{"startMs":1120880,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"saw that thing that was definitely you"},{"startMs":1122799,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"know the thing was moving way too fast"},{"startMs":1126080,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"just from if we imagine that was like a"},{"startMs":1128080,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"roundish object"},{"startMs":1129760,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"in the thing where we see that streak"},{"startMs":1132400,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"yeah right right"},{"startMs":1133919,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"see that because if you look at that"},{"startMs":1136559,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"it was moving way too fast"},{"startMs":1138880,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"to uh to be a natural member of

then"},{"startMs":1325360,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"there's also the creek lavas"},{"startMs":1328000,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"which is uh creep stands for

out"},{"startMs":1340720,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and and the last things to to like"},{"startMs":1343440,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"to to like separate out were creep

uh"},{"startMs":1763919,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and and that makes it less dense and so"},{"startMs":1766000,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"that causes the phenomena called

and"},{"startMs":1772880,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"look up something called einstein"},{"startMs":1775679,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"rings"},{"startMs":1776960,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"in

let"},{"startMs":1782080,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"me yeah okay yeah that is let's look for"},{"startMs":1784559,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"some more that have like a

uh"},{"startMs":1795279,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"yeah we want arcs kind of like einstein"},{"startMs":1797679,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"arcs and you'll notice one of the

these if you get if"},{"startMs":1809679,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"you go on you gotta really go on google"},{"startMs":1811520,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"images or something and see those but"},{"startMs":1813200,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"you'll see"},{"startMs":1814480,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you'll see that the colors if you

that"},{"startMs":1823520,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"are kind of spread out yeah each one of"},{"startMs":1825279,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"those is like a star or a galaxy and

what it is if we get the einstein"},{"startMs":1835520,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"rings you can actually see on some of"},{"startMs":1836960,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"these arcs it's not the

the"},{"startMs":1853039,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"the theory that theory actually three"},{"startMs":1854960,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"magnitudes better"},{"startMs":1856720,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"better uh"},{"startMs":1858159,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"mathematics is by itself proof

are"},{"startMs":1867760,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"different from the colors in the center"},{"startMs":1869760,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"if you can find the right one of

one"},{"startMs":1875600,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"that that has it but uh that just shows"},{"startMs":1878080,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"that what's happening is is light is"},{"startMs":1879919,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"being bent through refraction the same"},{"startMs":1881760,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"way when you uh when you put a like

look"},{"startMs":1894799,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"really careful at these rings and you"},{"startMs":1896960,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"look at the edges of the horns
