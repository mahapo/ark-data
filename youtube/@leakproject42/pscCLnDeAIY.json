it"},{"startMs":1146240,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"in front of the camera and see if we can"},{"startMs":1148280,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"get it to do the same thing and then"},{"startMs":1149840,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"maybe we could reverse these images and"},{"startMs":1151820,"durationMs":6239,"subtitle":"we could do some x-ray images
