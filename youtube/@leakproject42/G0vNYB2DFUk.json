what's"},{"startMs":231640,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"going on we need to look at what the"},{"startMs":233110,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"Great Attractor is but before we do that"},{"startMs":235180,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"let's start at the beginning so m86"},{"startMs":238960,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"which is not the same as m87 which is"},{"startMs":241360,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"the one with the black hole image but"},{"startMs":243010,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"m806 which is nearby m87 but it is a"},{"startMs":246250,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"galaxy that we have been observing for"},{"startMs":248470,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"over 200 years but the problem is in all"},{"startMs":251800,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"that time we've been observing it we"},{"startMs":253480,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"don't know what it looks like and if you"},{"startMs":255010,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"if you look at the image you can see"},{"startMs":257260,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"it's sort of blobby that's the basic my"},{"startMs":260650,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"my technical description is it just"},{"startMs":262420,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"looks like a blob and normally when we"},{"startMs":264370,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"look at galaxies obviously the Milky Way"},{"startMs":266400,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"spiral galaxy there are things called"},{"startMs":268930,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"lenticular galaxies which is sort of"},{"startMs":270700,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"stretched out but this one is very"},{"startMs":273280,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"difficult for them to classify until"},{"startMs":275740,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"recently and with obviously the advent"},{"startMs":279130,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"of better telescopes the Hubble is able"},{"startMs":281560,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"to see things in x-ray there's Chandra"},{"startMs":283810,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"which is another teiescope that it's"},{"startMs":285250,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"also able to see these things they were"},{"startMs":287710,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"able to take more image of this and"},{"startMs":289510,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"those images revealed something rather"},{"startMs":291580,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"interesting so when you look at this"},{"startMs":294280,"durationMs":6630,"subtitle":"image so again here is where we see m86"},{"startMs":297580,"durationMs":6089,"subtitle":"so that's the same that part of the blob"},{"startMs":300910,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"but when we look here we see it there"},{"startMs":303669,"durationMs":6601,"subtitle":"and what you see behind here is sort of"},{"startMs":307120,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"what looks like a streak of of material"},{"startMs":310270,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"being drawn outwards but interesting"},{"startMs":312970,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"enough it's still that I would almost"},{"startMs":314500,"durationMs":2850,"subtitle":"say when you look at this image there's"},{"startMs":315730,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"sort of two halves to it sort of a"},{"startMs":317350,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"curved upwards and there is also equally"},{"startMs":319390,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"a curve down here and when they examined"},{"startMs":322450,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"this they sort of and obviously this is"},{"startMs":324729,"durationMs":2761,"subtitle":"the image that they're dealing with it's"},{"startMs":326050,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"not like you know the image you can see"},{"startMs":327490,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"behind me which has more clarity in it"},{"startMs":330160,"durationMs":6630,"subtitle":"but obviously they base what's going on"},{"startMs":333850,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"on the fact that this must be a galaxy"},{"startMs":336790,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"and therefore in order for it to have"},{"startMs":339400,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"this shape something must be pulling it"},{"startMs":341500,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"apart so that's the story we're gonna"},{"startMs":343870,"durationMs":5609,"subtitle":"sort of look at and this will lead us"},{"startMs":345220,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"into a bit of a rabbit hole which was"},{"startMs":349479,"durationMs":4910,"subtitle":"gonna ask many questions"},{"startMs":351840,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"so let's just start by understanding"},{"startMs":354389,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"what m86 is so m86"},{"startMs":357030,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"is is a galaxy that is part of what is"},{"startMs":360210,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"called the Virgo cluster and this this"},{"startMs":361949,"durationMs":5881,"subtitle":"is a massive cluster of galaxies over a"},{"startMs":364860,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"hundred galaxies groups or clusters of"},{"startMs":367830,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"galaxies fit in in the Virgo cluster and"},{"startMs":370650,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"it spans about a hundred million"},{"startMs":372830,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"light-years so it's quite large and it's"},{"startMs":376440,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"located from where we sit it's about 50"},{"startMs":378990,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"million light years away which is a"},{"startMs":380940,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"significant distance and what we do know"},{"startMs":383940,"durationMs":4970,"subtitle":"is that the Ferger cluster is moving"},{"startMs":386280,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"towards what we call the Great Attractor"},{"startMs":388910,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"and when they analyzed ma T sixes sort"},{"startMs":392700,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"of movements and we'll talk about how"},{"startMs":394830,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"they do that later on but they worked"},{"startMs":396780,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"out that this galaxy was moving towards"},{"startMs":399750,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"us at over well I've written down five"},{"startMs":403350,"durationMs":4289,"subtitle":"hundred thousand miles per hour but"},{"startMs":406080,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"actually if you use the numbers that"},{"startMs":407639,"durationMs":4741,"subtitle":"they give you you can actually calculate"},{"startMs":409740,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"it to be over two million miles an hour"},{"startMs":412380,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"that is a speed at which is moving"},{"startMs":414360,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"towards us but is equally moving across"},{"startMs":417360,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"from us as well and just to give you an"},{"startMs":420270,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"understanding of where the Virgo cluster"},{"startMs":421710,"durationMs":4829,"subtitle":"sits so again in in this image this is"},{"startMs":424440,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the the Virgo cluster over here so it's"},{"startMs":426539,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"a massive cluster of galaxies and then"},{"startMs":429240,"durationMs":5549,"subtitle":"we sit just to the side of it and then"},{"startMs":431849,"durationMs":5451,"subtitle":"over on this side here is the the Great"},{"startMs":434789,"durationMs":8940,"subtitle":"Attractor and the very cluster is moving"},{"startMs":437300,"durationMs":8020,"subtitle":"towards that great attractor and as we"},{"startMs":443729,"durationMs":3031,"subtitle":"sit here we're also sort of being pulled"},{"startMs":445320,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"in that same direction so we're moving"},{"startMs":446760,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"in this direction and it's moving in"},{"startMs":448680,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"that direction towards this great"},{"startMs":450450,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"attractor so what on earth is the Great"},{"startMs":453780,"durationMs":4889,"subtitle":"Attractor you might ask we don't really"},{"startMs":456660,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"know the best theory is that there is"},{"startMs":458669,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"something large that sits behind here so"},{"startMs":461400,"durationMs":4949,"subtitle":"an even larger cluster of galaxies"},{"startMs":464639,"durationMs":3571,"subtitle":"creating sort of a gravitational"},{"startMs":466349,"durationMs":4411,"subtitle":"attraction which is pulling everything"},{"startMs":468210,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"in that direction a bit sort of like a"},{"startMs":470760,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"kitchen sink and we're not going to see"},{"startMs":473160,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"it just because of all the the lights"},{"startMs":474840,"durationMs":4259,"subtitle":"and everything that's in front of it is"},{"startMs":477750,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"that where we have or has it been"},{"startMs":479099,"durationMs":5391,"subtitle":"discovered no so indeed when we look at"},{"startMs":481770,"durationMs":6019,"subtitle":"this and if we"},{"startMs":484490,"durationMs":6329,"subtitle":"if I just exit this for a second so the"},{"startMs":487789,"durationMs":5611,"subtitle":"the velar cluster or other where the"},{"startMs":490819,"durationMs":5491,"subtitle":"Great Attractor sits is behind the Milky"},{"startMs":493400,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"Way so from where we see it we cannot"},{"startMs":496310,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"observe it so we only see the effect of"},{"startMs":498410,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"what's happening with a like other"},{"startMs":499970,"durationMs":5669,"subtitle":"galaxies sort of moving towards it so"},{"startMs":501860,"durationMs":6690,"subtitle":"it's our best assumption that it looks"},{"startMs":505639,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"something like this but in all honesty"},{"startMs":508550,"durationMs":4849,"subtitle":"we don't actually know because we can't"},{"startMs":510199,"durationMs":6661,"subtitle":"see this what we can see sits over here"},{"startMs":513399,"durationMs":5861,"subtitle":"so we make many assumptions but based on"},{"startMs":516860,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"the movement of those objects the the"},{"startMs":519260,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"assumption is that it's probably about"},{"startMs":521870,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"eight times larger than the Virgo"},{"startMs":525350,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"cluster so 800 to 900 million"},{"startMs":528770,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"light-years across"},{"startMs":529880,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"but we have no idea how many galaxies"},{"startMs":533000,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"would sit in it must be massive in order"},{"startMs":535430,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"for it to be pulling the objects that"},{"startMs":537290,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"vast distance and accelerating over that"},{"startMs":540170,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"speed but we don't know because we can't"},{"startMs":541940,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"see it"},{"startMs":544100,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"now remarkable yeah I mean it is"},{"startMs":546920,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"remarkable because again everything that"},{"startMs":549410,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"we observe so all the galaxies we"},{"startMs":550790,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"observe all along here are from where we"},{"startMs":553130,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"sit moving towards us and then when we"},{"startMs":555710,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"look in this direction what we see is"},{"startMs":557300,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"them moving away from us and then we see"},{"startMs":559580,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"the ones that sit further behind here"},{"startMs":561650,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"moving towards it so this sort of like a"},{"startMs":563180,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"a dance going on in terms of the"},{"startMs":565700,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"galaxies moving towards what we assume"},{"startMs":569150,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"is towards this point and you know we"},{"startMs":572660,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"can talk at some stage but not today"},{"startMs":574370,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"about these big blue areas the void"},{"startMs":577220,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"areas but that's a different story"},{"startMs":579560,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"so how do we how do we even measure the"},{"startMs":582680,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"distance how do they know that that this"},{"startMs":584600,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"galaxy is you know 50 million light"},{"startMs":586640,"durationMs":6510,"subtitle":"years away from Earth most of for"},{"startMs":590780,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"objects that are that far away from from"},{"startMs":593150,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"the Milky Way we use something called"},{"startMs":594380,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"redshift and this assumes that the"},{"startMs":598550,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"universe is expanding so it's back to"},{"startMs":600140,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"this story of the Big Bang which as you"},{"startMs":602210,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"know I don't particularly believe in but"},{"startMs":604430,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"that idea is that the universe itself is"},{"startMs":606860,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"expanding and as the universe expands it"},{"startMs":609050,"durationMs":3210,"subtitle":"means that objects are moving further"},{"startMs":610640,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"away and if you assume that it all"},{"startMs":612260,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"started with a small point it means that"},{"startMs":614660,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"the objects that are furthest away you"},{"startMs":616340,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"must be traveling faster it's like an"},{"startMs":618320,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"explosion yeah everything started at the"},{"startMs":620120,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"same point those further away must be"},{"startMs":622220,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"traveling faster so therefore when we"},{"startMs":624140,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"look at objects like you stand at the"},{"startMs":626540,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"side of a road and you've got a

technically"},{"startMs":1462630,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"they didn't actually leave our"},{"startMs":1464700,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"atmosphere so yeah so we can take that"},{"startMs":1468450,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"we can take that concept of of an"},{"startMs":1471420,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"electrical comet and can we apply it

what"},{"startMs":1485730,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"they call the comic galaxy it is a"},{"startMs":1489240,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"galaxy but obviously if you compare it"},{"startMs":1491910,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"to this image it very much looks like a"},{"startMs":1494100,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"comment sort of with it drawn out now"},{"startMs":1495990,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"again they think in this case this is an"},{"startMs":1498510,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"example again for them off of Ram"},{"startMs":1500820,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"pressure stripping but if we take this"},{"startMs":1503760,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"concept of an electrical imbalance is it"},{"startMs":1507150,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"possible that galaxies in some parts of"},{"startMs":1510240,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"the universe have a different

the"},{"startMs":1517500,"durationMs":6030,"subtitle":"whole thing starts going into glow mode"},{"startMs":1519720,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"and material ends up being excavated

very"},{"startMs":1544320,"durationMs":5910,"subtitle":"much an electric universe concept there"},{"startMs":1548940,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"are still questions that I have about"},{"startMs":1550230,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"this so again in in in this example they"},{"startMs":1553830,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"would explain that the reason that the"},{"startMs":1556590,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"objects are moving at such a high speed"},{"startMs":1558030,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"is because this galaxy would then

why"},{"startMs":1576180,"durationMs":6630,"subtitle":"it has a tail as well but where is that"},{"startMs":1579510,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"margin yeah so looking at the Milky

of"},{"startMs":1604440,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"an idea is that the arms spiral in so"},{"startMs":1608370,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"the material flows inwards and then

there"},{"startMs":1883190,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"in some sense going back to what you"},{"startMs":1885110,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"said is there an underlying

the"},{"startMs":2040950,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"more you it is the Borg cube I showed my"},{"startMs":2043860,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"son he's like oh that's the Borg

so"},{"startMs":2050340,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"we've talked about this before the fact"},{"startMs":2052110,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"that everything in the universe

these"},{"startMs":2067590,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"things together and that's obviously why"},{"startMs":2069990,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"we can't see it and the question then"},{"startMs":2073290,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"becomes it is it possible that actually"},{"startMs":2075210,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"the reason we see these narrow channels"},{"startMs":2077220,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and the reason that the galaxies are"},{"startMs":2079830,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"moving is because they're basically"},{"startMs":2081060,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"following some of these filaments"},{"startMs":2082770,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"they're travelling along these

again"},{"startMs":2110170,"durationMs":3929,"subtitle":"how does that work because normally they"},{"startMs":2111910,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"just sort of follow the flow yeah here"},{"startMs":2114099,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"there has to be traveling faster yeah"},{"startMs":2115660,"durationMs":2609,"subtitle":"could we go back to that image

which"},{"startMs":2739000,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"occurs when you increase the density so"},{"startMs":2742120,"durationMs":3050,"subtitle":"if the light wave is passing into

up"},{"startMs":2757320,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"with this process of blue and red shift"},{"startMs":2759450,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"depending on the density changes of

look"},{"startMs":2768270,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"at these numbers so is it possible"},{"startMs":2771090,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"therefore that when we look at these"},{"startMs":2772980,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"charts and we see you know galaxies that"},{"startMs":2775800,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"are red shifted and we see galaxies that"},{"startMs":2777690,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"are blue shifted but in fact this may"},{"startMs":2779910,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"have nothing to do with a movement

what's"},{"startMs":2786150,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"going on in between us and the object"},{"startMs":2789119,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"itself so is there some increase

a"},{"startMs":2815670,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"decrease in density is that a different"},{"startMs":2818160,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"way to look at this again another

then"},{"startMs":2828150,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"most of them have what they call a bow"},{"startMs":2829560,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"shock which is like you know when

where"},{"startMs":2843780,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"we see ionization we're seeing plasma so"},{"startMs":2847619,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"therefore could the front of this galaxy"},{"startMs":2849570,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"already start to explain the fact that"},{"startMs":2852540,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"it's blue shifted because we've

this"},{"startMs":2870180,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"image now on top of this there are some"},{"startMs":2872670,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"very strange properties that apply to"},{"startMs":2874950,"durationMs":5909,"subtitle":"all ram stripped galaxies and then is"},{"startMs":2878790,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"that they are bluer in color and not"},{"startMs":2880859,"durationMs":2311,"subtitle":"because they're moving too"},{"startMs":2881790,"durationMs":2850,"subtitle":"because obviously when we look at

they"},{"startMs":2896580,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"explain the fact of the blue because"},{"startMs":2898260,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"they say that these are younger

right"},{"startMs":2911010,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"that might absolutely be the case but I"},{"startMs":2913410,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"would argue why is it that the
