the"},{"startMs":310639,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"ones you see behind me"},{"startMs":312320,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"and so he with"},{"startMs":313840,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"richard

at first they"},{"startMs":321440,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"synthesized it"},{"startMs":322960,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"in the lab and then to prove it was"},{"startMs":325120,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"actually what absorbing it between the"},{"startMs":326560,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"stars they had to actually have this"},{"startMs":327919,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"super cold chamber where they agreed"},{"startMs":330479,"durationMs":5681,"subtitle":"they grew neon frost

prize in chemistry in 1996"},{"startMs":353600,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"for the discovery because it's kind of a"},{"startMs":355039,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"unique molecule it's like you can see"},{"startMs":356639,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"it's spherical it's really the first of"},{"startMs":358160,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"its kind"},{"startMs":359280,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and uh and it likes to take a positive"},{"startMs":361120,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"charge because it is about three and

uh"},{"startMs":366720,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"the molecule"},{"startMs":368479,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"and it does it not by giving out"},{"startMs":370000,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"electron into the environment which as"},{"startMs":371680,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"virtually every other molecule does

on"},{"startMs":377600,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"the inside"},{"startMs":378960,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and so that's that which is unique and"},{"startMs":380800,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"also that's one of its reasons why it's"},{"startMs":382960,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"uh one of the most powerful

do"},{"startMs":396319,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"is it can accept electrons or if it gets"},{"startMs":399280,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"extra ones give it out and uh"},{"startMs":401919,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"and what it's it only but what's the"},{"startMs":403759,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"uniqueness it only reacts with two"},{"startMs":405440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"oxidative radicals in the body"},{"startMs":407440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"one is super oxide and that's the

rust"},{"startMs":417199,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"super resting you know you know you put"},{"startMs":419280,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"a piece of iron out there super

five"},{"startMs":422479,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"minutes"},{"startMs":423440,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"from the iron oxide so and then it also"},{"startMs":425680,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"deals with the hydroxyl ion"},{"startMs":427919,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"which is the second most uh oxidative"},{"startMs":430400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"radical of the body"},{"startMs":432080,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and what's really good is both of

nitrous"},{"startMs":460319,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"oxide isn't production being produced"},{"startMs":461919,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"right a guy would know that uh then"},{"startMs":464560,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"there's hydrogen peroxide that's also"},{"startMs":466639,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"used as a signal molecule and then"},{"startMs":468319,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"there's a variety of other ones based"},{"startMs":469919,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"around sulfur iron and zinc they have"},{"startMs":471440,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"like molecules around that it's those in"},{"startMs":473840,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"the center and the body uses those

it"},{"startMs":480479,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"has it's virtually safe at any level you"},{"startMs":483280,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"know i talked about you know how we"},{"startMs":485199,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"talked about like the first study one of"},{"startMs":487120,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"the first studies that don't pretty much"},{"startMs":488800,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"double the lifespan of rats and"},{"startMs":491280,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"increase the lifespan of mice and in my"},{"startMs":493039,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"case i i was i went started using it"},{"startMs":495120,"durationMs":6479,"subtitle":"because it protected rats against deadly"},{"startMs":497599,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"radiation but that stuff was about 0.2"},{"startMs":501599,"durationMs":5361,"subtitle":"you know it was like"},{"startMs":503360,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"0.2 milligrams per kilogram right or 0.1"},{"startMs":506960,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"milligrams per kilogram which is a"},{"startMs":508400,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"really low amount right but when they"},{"startMs":510400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"did safety studies they actually because"},{"startMs":512240,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"it did all this positive so they wanted"},{"startMs":514000,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"to find out how what is carbon 60 toxin"},{"startMs":516399,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"so they took it up to one gram per"},{"startMs":518719,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"kilogram of body weight that's 10"},{"startMs":521039,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"000 times right what a health beneficial"},{"startMs":524399,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"dose has been

on"},{"startMs":556240,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"the rats or the the mice in the first"},{"startMs":558000,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"place well first off they just did"},{"startMs":560160,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"toxology tests okay he wanted to say"},{"startMs":562399,"durationMs":2801,"subtitle":"here's this new molecule that

said"},{"startMs":567440,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"is this is this potentially toxic and so"},{"startMs":570640,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"when they did this test they they gave"},{"startMs":572240,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"you know one rats got c60 the other rats"},{"startMs":574560,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"didn't and then the other rats also got"},{"startMs":576320,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"olive oil there's like three sets of"},{"startMs":577839,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"them because c60 has to be dissolved

water"},{"startMs":583920,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"soluble and so uh they found that it"},{"startMs":586160,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"actually c60 actually increased the

test"},{"startMs":599519,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"right"},{"startMs":600320,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and uh and then then they did it with"},{"startMs":602160,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"mice and they found it worth mice could"},{"startMs":603920,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"also extend their lifespan in"},{"startMs":606160,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"in eliminating cognitive decline and the"},{"startMs":608959,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"first thing was worcester rats and

so"},{"startMs":620560,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"so that one and then they took it and"},{"startMs":621920,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"then they did the stuff with the"},{"startMs":623040,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"radiation or protected rats to get"},{"startMs":625519,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"deadly amounts of radiation they"},{"startMs":628079,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"you know they and then they did human"},{"startMs":629920,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"studies like the first human study was"},{"startMs":632079,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"with uh japanese and women they actually"},{"startMs":634160,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"put it in the c60 in the face

uh"},{"startMs":640800,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"their fine lines and wrinkles were"},{"startMs":642720,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"significantly reduced"},{"startMs":644880,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and then one of the next tests was they"},{"startMs":646560,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"used c60 topically for hair growth"},{"startMs":649680,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"and they found that c60 increased hair"},{"startMs":652240,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"growth i think like 25 or something"},{"startMs":654959,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"and that was topical use but anyone who"},{"startMs":656640,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"takes c60 knows that your nails and your"},{"startMs":659040,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"hair growth will increase"},{"startMs":660800,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"so it seems to make the uh the cycle the"},{"startMs":663600,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"hair cycle longer so your hair will grow"},{"startMs":665360,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"longer and thicker"},{"startMs":667440,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and in those people that don't have uh"},{"startMs":669839,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"like if you have male pattern

sleeping"},{"startMs":691040,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"follicles"},{"startMs":693120,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and then so yeah it's been known to be"},{"startMs":695680,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"for skin and for hair it can help but"},{"startMs":697760,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"what about like you brought up radiation"},{"startMs":700720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and it seems like there's more cosmic"},{"startMs":702640,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"radiation now"},{"startMs":704160,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"and people are exposed to more emf"},{"startMs":706160,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"radiation now oftentimes not always

work"},{"startMs":711279,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":713120,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"would it be best to like put it on your"},{"startMs":715120,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"skin too"},{"startMs":716560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"or well for if you're it's they found in"},{"startMs":719120,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"scientific studies with human skin cells"},{"startMs":721120,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"in the end you know test tube basically"},{"startMs":723360,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"we found c60 human syn skills that had"},{"startMs":725680,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"c60 on them were were hugely

x-rays"},{"startMs":740720,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"that actually goes through your body and"},{"startMs":742399,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"sometimes it'll hit it'll hit an"},{"startMs":743839,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"electron in your body and knock it out"},{"startMs":746399,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"and then that makes you that

electrons"},{"startMs":752560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"so that they don't you know because that"},{"startMs":754240,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"can cause a cascade of damage you know"},{"startMs":756000,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"one molecule damages another which"},{"startMs":757760,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"damages another and down the line

them"},{"startMs":763519,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"with uh the hydrogen ions that's pulled"},{"startMs":765440,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"out of the environment and reset

hydrogen"},{"startMs":770560,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"ions out of the environment stores it in"},{"startMs":772560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that cage-like structure behind me"},{"startMs":774800,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"and then when the oxidative radicals"},{"startMs":776320,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"which are negatively charged are"},{"startMs":777839,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"attracted to the positively charged c60"},{"startMs":779760,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"it basically just neutralizes them"},{"startMs":782399,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"in the case of ox superoxide back to"},{"startMs":784720,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"oxygen just takes the electron away

water"},{"startMs":792240,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":793040,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and then then it resets itself again and"},{"startMs":794880,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"again which is kind of its secret that's"},{"startMs":796240,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"why it's characterized as several"},{"startMs":798240,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"hundred times more powerful than"},{"startMs":799519,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"conventional antioxidants because it can"},{"startMs":801519,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"reset itself"},{"startMs":802880,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"like something like if you took like"},{"startMs":804160,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"vitamin c or some of these other"},{"startMs":805519,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"antioxidants right once they meet an"},{"startMs":807440,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"oxidative radical there they bind to it"},{"startMs":809279,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"and they change right and then the

well because of its k it's round"},{"startMs":828480,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"spherical structure"},{"startMs":830000,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"i mean there's no molecule really like"},{"startMs":831839,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"it the fluorines are unique in that cage"},{"startMs":833760,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"round spherical thing and then it pulls"},{"startMs":836240,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"hydrogen ions onto the inside of itself"},{"startMs":838880,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"and uh it's just yeah there's just"},{"startMs":840639,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"there's nothing at all like it in"},{"startMs":842079,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"chemistry"},{"startMs":844000,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"and how is it made in nature"},{"startMs":846320,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"well in

c60"},{"startMs":854720,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"in the same way like it may be like uh"},{"startMs":856959,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"like lightning strikes hit trees

there"},{"startMs":863279,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":864240,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"in in out in outer space it's mostly"},{"startMs":866560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"made

and"},{"startMs":887440,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"then you i'm thinking about you"},{"startMs":889040,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"mentioned something a while ago about"},{"startMs":890399,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"how nasa had purchased"},{"startMs":893040,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"a bunch of c60"},{"startMs":895120,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and it had something to do with do you"},{"startMs":896639,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"think they were testing for radiation"},{"startMs":898560,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"protection or something like that for"},{"startMs":900079,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"some of the space yeah they're probably"},{"startMs":901600,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"using it yeah i would suspect they're"},{"startMs":903279,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"using it for radiation protection"},{"startMs":904959,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"they're probably doing studies for the"},{"startMs":906079,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"military against uh radiation because"},{"startMs":908720,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"you know they had one set of

that"},{"startMs":916720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"didn't get it would immediately die"},{"startMs":918720,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and so you know there's a lot of"},{"startMs":920320,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"radiation space so they were probably"},{"startMs":922480,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"testing it but eventually they uh i"},{"startMs":924800,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"think they've learned how to make c60"},{"startMs":926560,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"themselves"},{"startMs":927760,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and so"},{"startMs":928880,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"they uh they have their own c60 plant"},{"startMs":931120,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"somewhere the us government's making its"},{"startMs":933199,"durationMs":5361,"subtitle":"own c60 so it doesn't need to buy

yeah meal's ready to eat yeah"},{"startMs":968959,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"put them in boiling water and open them"},{"startMs":971040,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"up and they're just like well they taste"},{"startMs":972959,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"terrible"},{"startMs":973920,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"quite frankly"},{"startMs":975519,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"mmm got to get

it'll"},{"startMs":982399,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"taste totally different you'll just"},{"startMs":984160,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"magnify yourself"},{"startMs":986240,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"i wonder how much like the magnetic"},{"startMs":990880,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"aren't those mris they have like big"},{"startMs":993600,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"magnets or something like that"},{"startMs":995279,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"do you know much about those"},{"startMs":996959,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"oh yeah i know about those yeah they're"},{"startMs":998240,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"super conductive they basically cause uh"},{"startMs":1001279,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"very pretty much the hydrogens or"},{"startMs":1002880,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"fluoride or something to which are

all"},{"startMs":1012959,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"so they do have one the gadolinium one"},{"startMs":1015040,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"where they use that gadolinium"},{"startMs":1016880,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"that they uh that then they use an"},{"startMs":1018639,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"x-rays to to make it

poison"},{"startMs":1025120,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"because it's a heavy metal"},{"startMs":1026640,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"right but they what they do now is they"},{"startMs":1028240,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"actually can put c60 they can put"},{"startMs":1030079,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"gadolinium inside of the carbon 60"},{"startMs":1032480,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"there's a way of popping them open"},{"startMs":1034000,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"putting them in and then they can

burning"},{"startMs":1397360,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"so now you have these zombie cells"},{"startMs":1398880,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"senescent cells you're probably
