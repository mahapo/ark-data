the"},{"startMs":957339,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"concept is is very similar to the idea"},{"startMs":960370,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"that you know we compute based

a"},{"startMs":989259,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"microprocessor excuse me that's using"},{"startMs":991690,"durationMs":4709,"subtitle":"silicon and so it's the same kind

what"},{"startMs":998649,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"they're referring to is that DNA is a"},{"startMs":999910,"durationMs":4429,"subtitle":"very compact format and one thing we"},{"startMs":1002189,"durationMs":5731,"subtitle":"learn is nature is very good at"},{"startMs":1004339,"durationMs":5411,"subtitle":"optimization and so if we want to learn"},{"startMs":1007920,"durationMs":4289,"subtitle":"the most efficient way to do something"},{"startMs":1009750,"durationMs":4769,"subtitle":"we look at nature and figure out

right"},{"startMs":1033179,"durationMs":5791,"subtitle":"so video games have driven technology"},{"startMs":1035569,"durationMs":5110,"subtitle":"like GPUs which are used today

optimizing"},{"startMs":1068310,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"the technology and so you know when the"},{"startMs":1070380,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"iPhone was

be"},{"startMs":1074790,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"games right so they had to optimize the"},{"startMs":1076650,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"processor in subsequent versions of

and"},{"startMs":1088860,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and so it turns out that DNA is a very"},{"startMs":1090660,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"compact way to do it and so my guess is"},{"startMs":1093420,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"that they were able to put that"},{"startMs":1094500,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"information in the same structure of DNA"},{"startMs":1097770,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"I'm not sure whether they were using"},{"startMs":1099060,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"what actual materials they were

we"},{"startMs":1109860,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"use binary so we have ones and zeros but"},{"startMs":1113250,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"within DNA I believe there's like the"},{"startMs":1114810,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"four different types of the what do they"},{"startMs":1117480,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"call those things that are the part

use"},{"startMs":1126090,"durationMs":6110,"subtitle":"it's almost like so--you binary you"},{"startMs":1129570,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"could use 3 or 4 so they use 4

it"},{"startMs":1152610,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"and then the other way I think is that"},{"startMs":1153540,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"the geometrical structure allows for

turn"},{"startMs":3233489,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that color but it well what it's really"},{"startMs":3235439,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"doing is using the fact that the

can"},{"startMs":3345550,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"still see the physical world around you"},{"startMs":3348280,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"and then we overlay objects right and so"},{"startMs":3351760,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"there's companies like magic leap and"},{"startMs":3353380,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"Microsoft has the hololens and a lot

glasses"},{"startMs":3370960,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"I'm wearing right now and you put them"},{"startMs":3372760,"durationMs":3570,"subtitle":"on and then you see like a person who's"},{"startMs":3374680,"durationMs":3510,"subtitle":"talking to you"},{"startMs":3376330,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"so it's an augmented reality type"},{"startMs":3378190,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"situation with like glasses kind of like"},{"startMs":3380560,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"in Star Wars really have the

hologram"},{"startMs":3399940,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"and and so those are coming right now we"},{"startMs":3402850,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"still require glasses they are glasses"},{"startMs":3405790,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"for these types of holograms there's a"},{"startMs":3408130,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"company called spatial that's making

the"},{"startMs":3421480,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"hardware needs to get lighter and"},{"startMs":3423160,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"simpler right to the point where it's"},{"startMs":3425470,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"just glasses but what they are shows us"},{"startMs":3429340,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"is that physical objects can be"},{"startMs":3431200,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"represented as information right and so"},{"startMs":3434080,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"I mean that's what 3d printing is all"},{"startMs":3435820,"durationMs":3150,"subtitle":"about right so if you remember in Star"},{"startMs":3437620,"durationMs":3270,"subtitle":"Trek right"},{"startMs":3438970,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"you know Captain Picard would say TR oh"},{"startMs":3440890,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"very hot and it would materialize a cup"},{"startMs":3443410,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"and and the tea inside of it right and"},{"startMs":3446110,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"so we have 3d printers that can do the"},{"startMs":3448360,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"basics of that that can print out a cup"},{"startMs":3450490,"durationMs":4230,"subtitle":"by using three dimensional pixels

patterns"},{"startMs":3462130,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"of information and then what we call"},{"startMs":3464590,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"matter or really is really taking

arranged"},{"startMs":3471770,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"three dimensionally so that it looks to"},{"startMs":3474140,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"us and so there's a whole field

cup"},{"startMs":3481220,"durationMs":5430,"subtitle":"in this room and I can figure out how"},{"startMs":3483890,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"the light bounces to me versus say"},{"startMs":3486650,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"somebody who's across the room on the"},{"startMs":3488930,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"other side then they can have an
