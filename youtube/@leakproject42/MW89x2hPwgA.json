okay"},{"startMs":446000,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"my alarm says i'm not okay if i think"},{"startMs":447680,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"about that although i need to rebuild"},{"startMs":448960,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and take it out and breathe in pressure"},{"startMs":451599,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"i know"},{"startMs":452560,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"of course"},{"startMs":453759,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"yes we don't know who you are

so"},{"startMs":463840,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"this is the den solar telescope this is"},{"startMs":465680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"our last actively used telescope and"},{"startMs":467599,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"site so at one time there was a total of"},{"startMs":469360,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"four telescopes being used to look at"},{"startMs":470800,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"the sun and this is the last one that"},{"startMs":472800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"remains in use and this telescope is"},{"startMs":474960,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"over 50 years old which is pretty"},{"startMs":476800,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"remarkable that it's still"},{"startMs":479360,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"able to produce data and be actively"},{"startMs":481840,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"used and really that's because they"},{"startMs":483520,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"implemented some key features in its"},{"startMs":485280,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"structure that have allowed us to be"},{"startMs":487520,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"useful and so i'm going to kind of"},{"startMs":489199,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"highlight those features to you first if"},{"startMs":491360,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"you didn't already notice um this"},{"startMs":493440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"structure was built in 1966 it was"},{"startMs":496240,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"actually built by the air force took in"},{"startMs":498080,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"three years to build it finished in"},{"startMs":499759,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"october of 1916. why did they build it"},{"startMs":502160,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"like was there a specific reason yeah"},{"startMs":504319,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"so um we're coming out of world war ii"},{"startMs":506560,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and that's when the military discovered"},{"startMs":508400,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"that the sun had affected radar readings"},{"startMs":510720,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"and radio communications okay so they"},{"startMs":512640,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"wanted to start studying it and so they"},{"startMs":515279,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"this was a great site because i want our"},{"startMs":518000,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"dry climate"},{"startMs":519599,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"low light and air pollution lots of"},{"startMs":521760,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"sunshine but holloman air force base and"},{"startMs":524240,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"white sands missile range were already"},{"startMs":525839,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"established and so they were in close"},{"startMs":527760,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"proximity to provide that support and"},{"startMs":530399,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"infrastructure"},{"startMs":532320,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"oh sorry interrupt i was just i had"},{"startMs":533839,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"another question was it possibly"},{"startMs":535760,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"connected to the activity of the sun"},{"startMs":537360,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"they wanted to see if there could be"},{"startMs":538640,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"some type of solar flare in the future"},{"startMs":540560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that could cause you know well they knew"},{"startMs":542480,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"that because of world war ii how it had"},{"startMs":544320,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"affected their radar readings or radio"},{"startMs":546320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"communications they wanted to see why"},{"startMs":548160,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"that is so what's going on and so yes"},{"startMs":550399,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"they wanted to start studying it to see"},{"startMs":552800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"what's causing the sun to behave the way"},{"startMs":554640,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"it does and see if they could figure out"},{"startMs":556560,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"what those patterns are did they figure"},{"startMs":558480,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it out"},{"startMs":559440,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"um that shows you how complex the sun is"},{"startMs":561440,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"is that we're still i mean they've been"},{"startMs":563519,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"saying this youth sun for like hundreds"},{"startMs":565279,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"of years we still haven't figured it out"},{"startMs":567200,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"right i would say the still tied to the"},{"startMs":569040,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"air force today no so we've changed"},{"startMs":570880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"several hands so we went to national"},{"startMs":572560,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"solar observatory and now we're operated"},{"startMs":574640,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"by were overseen by new mexico state"},{"startMs":576640,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"university out of las cruces"},{"startMs":579200,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"but um"},{"startMs":580560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"yeah so let me kind of explain to you a"},{"startMs":582720,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"little bit how unique our structure is"},{"startMs":584320,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":585120,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"you see 136 feet up in the air so our"},{"startMs":588080,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"telescope is set on a vertical axis"},{"startMs":590399,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"and there's 136 feet up in the air a lot"},{"startMs":593120,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"of people compare us to an iceberg"},{"startMs":594800,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"though and that's because the majority"},{"startMs":596160,"durationMs":5359,"subtitle":"of our structure lies below the ground"},{"startMs":598320,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"so from the ground floor down it's 228"},{"startMs":601519,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"feet all of that is a single instrument"},{"startMs":603680,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"kept in a vacuum seal so if you did your"},{"startMs":605519,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"math and added up those numbers i just"},{"startMs":607040,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"gave you that's over 360 feet so bigger"},{"startMs":609279,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"than a football field of a single"},{"startMs":611519,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"instrument kept in a vacuum seal now the"},{"startMs":613760,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"reason why they built it so tall is that"},{"startMs":615760,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"allows us to place our entrance window"},{"startMs":617600,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"where the sunlight enters at the very"},{"startMs":619440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"top and by doing so we're able to

level"},{"startMs":626800,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you heard me mention that vacuum seal"},{"startMs":628480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"well that's another way that

and"},{"startMs":747839,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"so you solve that problem by using the"},{"startMs":749839,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"mercury so technically you could

not"},{"startMs":756079,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"in operation and it's not um we're"},{"startMs":758720,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"sometimes able to demonstrate that by"},{"startMs":760399,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"just pushing it with your foot yeah"},{"startMs":763120,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"so the reason why it's so far"},{"startMs":764399,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"underground is so we can really magnify"},{"startMs":768079,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"those images of the sun and get

to"},{"startMs":793760,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"cloud crossfire"},{"startMs":795120,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"yes so there's a 300 magnification and"},{"startMs":797680,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"the observer on top of the truck is 360."},{"startMs":800079,"durationMs":7041,"subtitle":"so but how far is cloud crop from here"},{"startMs":803760,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"oh wow yeah that's impressive"},{"startMs":807120,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"our telescope is able to see a 90 mile"},{"startMs":809920,"durationMs":5359,"subtitle":"area and so it gets the by having this"},{"startMs":813040,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"long focal length it's really able to"},{"startMs":815279,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"blow up those images and see high"},{"startMs":817760,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"details um and it's a 90 mile area and"},{"startMs":820480,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"so when you go inside the observing room"},{"startMs":823040,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"this isn't a telescope you ever get to"},{"startMs":824560,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"put your eye up to not even they get to"},{"startMs":826399,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"do that everything's fit

before"},{"startMs":835839,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"all those clouds started to roll in you"},{"startMs":837519,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"would have been able to see some really"},{"startMs":839199,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"nice clusters of sunspots which was"},{"startMs":841199,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"awesome to see"},{"startMs":842480,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"but another thing you'll see when they"},{"startMs":844079,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"pull the lights up for us is our"},{"startMs":845600,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"flexibility with our optics so this"},{"startMs":847600,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"really is the key why after 50 years"},{"startMs":849519,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"we're still actively used because all"},{"startMs":852000,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"our optics are housed out on tables"},{"startMs":854240,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"around the tube of the telescope and"},{"startMs":856399,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"they all have different instruments we"},{"startMs":857839,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"use to look at the sun and literally"},{"startMs":859360,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"everything is bolted to the table so if"},{"startMs":861360,"durationMs":3279,"subtitle":"you'd come a couple weeks ago they were"},{"startMs":862800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"in the process of unbolting one of the"},{"startMs":864639,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"instruments and now this crew that you"},{"startMs":866560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"met from ireland if you interacted with"},{"startMs":868959,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"them a little bit they've been hanging"},{"startMs":870000,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"out outside but they actually built the"},{"startMs":872000,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"new instrument and now testing it and so"},{"startMs":874240,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"that's pretty cool to say that after 50"},{"startMs":877199,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"years we're still able to"},{"startMs":879279,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":880320,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"yeah serve the community like that and"},{"startMs":883519,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"so that's a unique feature of our"},{"startMs":885360,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"telescope and i think"},{"startMs":888079,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"i have shared everything i know about"},{"startMs":890240,"durationMs":2399,"subtitle":"this

friday um and it's a crew"},{"startMs":912240,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"of like four or five and then so we have"},{"startMs":914560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"a core crew that runs the operations of"},{"startMs":917040,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"the telescope"},{"startMs":918320,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"every day and then we have

the"},{"startMs":925440,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"research here and i'll contribute"},{"startMs":927920,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"were there a lot of people up here when"},{"startMs":929440,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"they like about two years ago yeah"},{"startMs":932720,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"um that was before my time so since

those"},{"startMs":1185679,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"basically what they can do is"},{"startMs":1188559,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"so you see over there they can put a"},{"startMs":1190960,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"reflector"},{"startMs":1192640,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"so the prism on the top will come

the"},{"startMs":1307120,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"bottom and then the actual light table"},{"startMs":1309520,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"is around the other side okay so at that"},{"startMs":1312159,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"point the technicians just use"},{"startMs":1314320,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"a range of voltaics to split the

on"},{"startMs":1327360,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"the other side okay in theory you

you"},{"startMs":1331679,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"start splitting the light right you're"},{"startMs":1333120,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"right you get yourself right

you're"},{"startMs":1342320,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"coming straight out of the tube no it is"},{"startMs":1344320,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"yeah we've got a we've got plenty

right"},{"startMs":1367600,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"right um if when we put the beam path"},{"startMs":1370320,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"through it to split it into colours"},{"startMs":1371679,"durationMs":2801,"subtitle":"you'd struggle to pick that up again"},{"startMs":1373200,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":1374480,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"but uh yeah whenever they're drawing in"},{"startMs":1376880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"perfect motion you can see"},{"startMs":1379200,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"you can see there's constituent

place"},{"startMs":1383760,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"that it's because it would melt the"},{"startMs":1385360,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"cameras right right right um so and what"},{"startMs":1388320,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"are you running from what's your lowest"},{"startMs":1390159,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"light frequency to your upper light"},{"startMs":1392000,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"frequency so you're going down into or"},{"startMs":1393919,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"up into"},{"startMs":1394960,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"400 440 470. and then down as low as"},{"startMs":1398720,"durationMs":6959,"subtitle":"let's say 650 680 so in terms of"},{"startMs":1402960,"durationMs":5199,"subtitle":"like wavelength yeah yeah so"},{"startMs":1405679,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"we're mainly concerned with the optical"},{"startMs":1408159,"durationMs":1681,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":1408960,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1409840,"durationMs":5839,"subtitle":"about 380 up to six fifteen maybe now"},{"startMs":1413679,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"okay okay yeah yeah exactly um but"},{"startMs":1415679,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"that's because of the instruments that"},{"startMs":1416720,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"we are interested in right you also have"},{"startMs":1418720,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"there's infrared instruments that would"},{"startMs":1420720,"durationMs":5439,"subtitle":"go up to 10 30 okay"},{"startMs":1423279,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"okay okay way up there yeah but uh so"},{"startMs":1426159,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"you're going all the way into flare"},{"startMs":1427919,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"yes"},{"startMs":1429200,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"into the infrared but in this run we are"},{"startMs":1431120,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"not interested in that we are"},{"startMs":1432559,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"commissioning an optical instrument so"},{"startMs":1434960,"durationMs":5599,"subtitle":"okay we're only feeding out the"},{"startMs":1437600,"durationMs":6559,"subtitle":"optical band path okay near near uv as"},{"startMs":1440559,"durationMs":6401,"subtitle":"well right right optical it's really um"},{"startMs":1444159,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"yeah you can't get below 380 if we go"},{"startMs":1446960,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"into space right right yeah and the the"},{"startMs":1449120,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"transmission's quite low later as well"},{"startMs":1451279,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"so with it being a commissioning run"},{"startMs":1453120,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"we're trying to basically push the"},{"startMs":1454480,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"limits of where we can get to so we have"},{"startMs":1457360,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"been down to"},{"startMs":1458640,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"are you gonna stay on that side"},{"startMs":1460960,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"but uh"},{"startMs":1462080,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you know it gets tougher down there you"},{"startMs":1463919,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"know when you're right at sodium which"},{"startMs":1465440,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"is 580. yeah right each i'll put six"},{"startMs":1469360,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"well six eight six five six three the"},{"startMs":1471440,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"road you drove up um"},{"startMs":1473440,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"your transmission's a lot better and you"},{"startMs":1475039,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"get a lot more light output so"},{"startMs":1478400,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"that's the kind of cola this one was"},{"startMs":1479760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"just to stress test everything and see"},{"startMs":1481360,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"just how far we could get it right"},{"startMs":1484000,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"everything starts breaking apart okay um"},{"startMs":1486480,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"which has been a success thus far thanks"},{"startMs":1488480,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"to the weather mainly right the rear"},{"startMs":1490880,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"well it's good for that here yeah good"},{"startMs":1492559,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"for the well the cloudless uh skies are"},{"startMs":1496400,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"we got none of them last week but we've"},{"startMs":1497760,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"got a good few days this week so right"},{"startMs":1499919,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"so how long of a stint will you stay"},{"startMs":1501360,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"here so you came over from ireland"},{"startMs":1503039,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"you'll be here forever yeah we have uh"},{"startMs":1504720,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"we'll be here until next monday we have"},{"startMs":1506559,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"okay so next monday um"},{"startMs":1508960,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and we came"},{"startMs":1510640,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"a week past friday okay"},{"startMs":1513120,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"we're kind of halfway through our run"},{"startMs":1515279,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"okay and then control of the operations"},{"startMs":1517600,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"go back to new mexico state in terms of"},{"startMs":1520240,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"where to point once right right and so"},{"startMs":1522159,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"on right so"},{"startMs":1524159,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"now do you do anything with the"},{"startMs":1525559,"durationMs":5081,"subtitle":"electromagnetic field of the sun"},{"startMs":1528480,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"or you just do the other visible objects"},{"startMs":1530640,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"at all so you don't so we have a so this"},{"startMs":1532720,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"one's from the commissioning is a"},{"startMs":1534240,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"spectral polarimeter so you can uh look"},{"startMs":1537440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"at the polarized light output okay"},{"startMs":1540080,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and start to look at the magnetic"},{"startMs":1541760,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"signatures okay the solar atmosphere um"},{"startMs":1546080,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"furs as well as another"},{"startMs":1547240,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"spectrophotometer as well so just by"},{"startMs":1549520,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"putting polarizers in the way of the"},{"startMs":1551760,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"the light you can get your strokes iq"},{"startMs":1553919,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"you and b's okay"},{"startMs":1557200,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"magnetic fields uh strengths"},{"startMs":1559200,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"inclinations directions and so on um but"},{"startMs":1562080,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"that's uh very very"},{"startMs":1564480,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"light sensitive so when we're currently"},{"startMs":1567120,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"just working with the unpolarized light"},{"startMs":1568559,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"so there's way more light right and when"},{"startMs":1571039,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"you start looking like 90 degree"},{"startMs":1572880,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"polarized light your light level drops"},{"startMs":1575520,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"by a factor of 100 right so um"},{"startMs":1578400,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"your exposure times then have to"},{"startMs":1579840,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"increase all the rest have to balance it"},{"startMs":1581520,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"out so with this being the first run"},{"startMs":1583840,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"there's a lot of polarization optics"},{"startMs":1585679,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"need to go into the beam path so um with"},{"startMs":1588240,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"just two weeks it would have been"},{"startMs":1589919,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"difficult to get everything set up at"},{"startMs":1591679,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"once so we'll probably be back this time"},{"startMs":1593760,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"next year to set the polarization"},{"startMs":1595679,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"component up um"},{"startMs":1598400,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"the data we've got the intense the"},{"startMs":1600000,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"stokes eye the unpolarized intensity"},{"startMs":1602559,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"has probably given us six seven years"},{"startMs":1604640,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"worth of right projects just on his own"},{"startMs":1607200,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":1608159,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"we're pretty excited to get back and"},{"startMs":1610720,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"start actually analyzing it"},{"startMs":1613200,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"but that'll involve locking all those"},{"startMs":1615039,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"hard drives back on the plane so"},{"startMs":1618159,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"we'll have some pretty heavy hand"},{"startMs":1619919,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"luggage"},{"startMs":1621919,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"right that's better than coming back"},{"startMs":1623440,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"with nothing right right which we have"},{"startMs":1625200,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"had in the past sadly when it's just"},{"startMs":1626799,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"been cloudy the whole time and you've"},{"startMs":1628080,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"returned with nothing at all so"},{"startMs":1630320,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"um yeah the weather's been kind to us"},{"startMs":1632240,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"this time around"},{"startMs":1633600,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1634320,"durationMs":2479,"subtitle":"well you need to get with the cloud"},{"startMs":1635440,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"seating people"},{"startMs":1636799,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so they can get rid of those clouds for"},{"startMs":1638240,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you i don't know if the new mexico"},{"startMs":1639679,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"state's budget quite uh"},{"startMs":1641600,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"well here there is wild seating in new"},{"startMs":1643600,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"mexico"},{"startMs":1644799,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"oh it's not been too bad at all yeah um"},{"startMs":1647760,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it's uh"},{"startMs":1649039,"durationMs":2961,"subtitle":"we've been lucky with thunderstorms at"},{"startMs":1650720,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"night sort of"},{"startMs":1652000,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"cooling the air clearing the clouds oh"},{"startMs":1653679,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"yeah that's good yeah so yesterday we"},{"startMs":1655600,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"had terrific uh scene like point one arc"},{"startMs":1658559,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"second which was basically a still image"},{"startMs":1661120,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"right um and then today we were able to"},{"startMs":1662799,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"observe up until"},{"startMs":1664559,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"close to one pm okay we're usually"},{"startMs":1666320,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"observing window ends at nine a.m right"},{"startMs":1668399,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"highly arrived to do tours and the place"},{"startMs":1669919,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"was still observing right must be a"},{"startMs":1671520,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"rarity yeah um usually by that point the"},{"startMs":1674080,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"sun's heated the atmosphere up too much"},{"startMs":1675840,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"right so much turbulent air but so do"},{"startMs":1677760,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"you have a preferred temperature range"},{"startMs":1680000,"durationMs":6799,"subtitle":"of the atmosphere so like 60"},{"startMs":1683039,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"60 degrees and below 30 humidity or yeah"},{"startMs":1686799,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"it's it's kind of all hauled up to"},{"startMs":1688559,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"measurement just of the scintillation of"},{"startMs":1690399,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"the air so the movement because"},{"startMs":1692480,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"um"},{"startMs":1694000,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"here you guys are on the jet stream"},{"startMs":1695840,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"paths right you low level you could have"},{"startMs":1698399,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"no seeing issues at all but the jet"},{"startMs":1700480,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"stream is picking up right case and so"},{"startMs":1703039,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"we just measure it by basically the"},{"startMs":1704799,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"angular scintillation of the air and you"},{"startMs":1707679,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"basically eyeball it you know because we"},{"startMs":1709840,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"have resolved uh structures like"},{"startMs":1712480,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"nighttime astronomers right right you"},{"startMs":1714240,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"just look at an image of sunspot you see"},{"startMs":1715840,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"it moving around and you you can go yeah"},{"startMs":1717840,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"that's good or bad right you can see a"},{"startMs":1719520,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"cloud passing over that sort of thing so"},{"startMs":1722080,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"in many ways we're fortunate you know we"},{"startMs":1723919,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"don't have uh any our adaptive optics is"},{"startMs":1726559,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"far easier to"},{"startMs":1728000,"durationMs":7279,"subtitle":"to run on so is is your research mainly"},{"startMs":1732000,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"pointed at sunspot activity or what what"},{"startMs":1735279,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"what what are you gathering all this for"},{"startMs":1738240,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"what do you want to learn from from what"},{"startMs":1741120,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"you're yes so our personal interests as"},{"startMs":1743840,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"a research group is"},{"startMs":1746240,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"wave activity and magnetic regions okay"},{"startMs":1748799,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"atmosphere so they're called mhd waves"},{"startMs":1751760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"it's the uh"},{"startMs":1753440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"when you have plasma pressure and"},{"startMs":1756000,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"magnetic fields interacting to create"},{"startMs":1757760,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"oscillations"},{"startMs":1758960,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"so they're one of the problems that"},{"startMs":1761520,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"leads me to do you know who valentino"},{"startMs":1763200,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"zorokova is yes okay do you study"},{"startMs":1766399,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"right well i know she's from northumbria"},{"startMs":1768320,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"university yes originally from ukraine"},{"startMs":1770480,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"what do you think of her work"},{"startMs":1772399,"durationMs":2321,"subtitle":"uh"},{"startMs":1773520,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you won't hurt our feelings either way"},{"startMs":1774720,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"just wondering yeah um"},{"startMs":1777120,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"aspirational i guess okay"},{"startMs":1779440,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":1780640,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"i've uh"},{"startMs":1781840,"durationMs":2719,"subtitle":"been to a lot of conferences

hearty"},{"startMs":1786720,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"debate afterwards right right i think uh"},{"startMs":1790080,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"she's a i think that's all the kind of"},{"startMs":1792080,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"the predictive modelling aspect of"},{"startMs":1793919,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"things though which is"},{"startMs":1795360,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"which is incredibly difficult to do well"},{"startMs":1798320,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"let's see she has credit well hold on"},{"startMs":1800880,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"let me ask you questions"},{"startMs":1804399,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"no no no you're not going to

to"},{"startMs":1913519,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"what tell us a little bit about that"},{"startMs":1914640,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"guys"},{"startMs":1915519,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"only a passing knowledge i mean this is"},{"startMs":1917600,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"my direction so all i know is that in"},{"startMs":1919840,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"passing we're we're basically"},{"startMs":1921519,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"predictions were made at the end of the"},{"startMs":1923120,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"last solar cycle and the people that are"},{"startMs":1925279,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"involved in the forecasting are"},{"startMs":1926880,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"effectively using this cycle as it"},{"startMs":1928399,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"progresses to retroactively see how"},{"startMs":1930799,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"accurate they are there's where and"},{"startMs":1933360,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"you know back in"},{"startMs":1934880,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"2014 2015 when there was fears of a

uh"},{"startMs":1941840,"durationMs":5439,"subtitle":"all of that those those predictions were"},{"startMs":1944000,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"all luckily for me seemed to be"},{"startMs":1947279,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"inaccurate because we've pretty good"},{"startMs":1948960,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"sunspot activity but but we've already"},{"startMs":1951200,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"had a spotless day this far into our"},{"startMs":1953679,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"solar cycle well you can obviously i"},{"startMs":1955600,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"mean you're you're only observing at"},{"startMs":1958080,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"best"},{"startMs":1959600,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"the solar disk and in any given time so"},{"startMs":1962640,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"right but if you look at it this this"},{"startMs":1964480,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"really is not my right right right right"},{"startMs":1966480,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"but"},{"startMs":1967200,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"yeah if you're interested in asking all"},{"startMs":1968880,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"about valentine's are cool for those"},{"startMs":1970240,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"which is right right so"},{"startMs":1974480,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"what we've been studying okay because"},{"startMs":1976399,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"i've been studying sun spots for 20"},{"startMs":1977760,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"years yeah okay in my last solar the"},{"startMs":1980559,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"last solar cycle my prediction was more"},{"startMs":1982480,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"accurate than most of the other people's"},{"startMs":1983919,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"predictions yeah i i predicted one"},{"startMs":1985919,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"picture"},{"startMs":1987120,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"for this pattern for this solar cycle"},{"startMs":1989679,"durationMs":5441,"subtitle":"i'm predicting a 30 drop off of that"},{"startMs":1992640,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"now i'm not predicting that drop until"},{"startMs":1995120,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"we get to our teeth and then i think"},{"startMs":1997200,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"we're going to drop extremely quickly"},{"startMs":1999519,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"but the fact that the other the other"},{"startMs":2001440,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"part that"},{"startMs":2003120,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"leads me to believe what zarkova is"},{"startMs":2005440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"saying is we've already seen"},{"startMs":2008159,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"the sun spots moving closer to the"},{"startMs":2010000,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"equatorial region than normal"},{"startMs":2012240,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and we've also seen the flipping of the"},{"startMs":2015200,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"solar polarity within the"},{"startMs":2016880,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"electromagnetic field of the sun which"},{"startMs":2018880,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"is again something we've never seen"},{"startMs":2021200,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"but if you read zarkova's work she talks"},{"startMs":2023200,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"about all of these things happening so"},{"startMs":2024960,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"that that's the yeah i mean to be"},{"startMs":2026880,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"perfectly honest to my research i don't"},{"startMs":2028799,"durationMs":3641,"subtitle":"really care yeah"},{"startMs":2035039,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"right honestly"},{"startMs":2036480,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"it's it's nothing more than a passing"},{"startMs":2038240,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"conference talk that i would be"},{"startMs":2039919,"durationMs":5841,"subtitle":"sitting in all right it's it's very far"},{"startMs":2043279,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"from my research and yes well we've"},{"startMs":2045760,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"interviewed her twice and and we've"},{"startMs":2047840,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"studied every paper she's written in the"},{"startMs":2049280,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"last 20 years"},{"startMs":2050560,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"yeah well that's part of our research in"},{"startMs":2052879,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"states and so on yeah i mean it's not"},{"startMs":2055599,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"it's not really"},{"startMs":2057119,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"the"},{"startMs":2058720,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"doesn't really overlap much of my right"},{"startMs":2060720,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"research right so okay nothing more than"},{"startMs":2063359,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"i say you know let's be honest yeah yeah"},{"startMs":2065280,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"so first of all thank you for yeah"},{"startMs":2067599,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"yeah league is passionate about stuff"},{"startMs":2070320,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"i"},{"startMs":2071119,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"i have somebody who hears past about"},{"startMs":2073200,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"stuff and he and he knows about a lot of"},{"startMs":2075280,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"stuff but i was going to ask you has"},{"startMs":2076480,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"there been a difference in the"},{"startMs":2078720,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"uh the sun feels a lot more extreme than"},{"startMs":2080879,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"it did 20 years ago and it seems"},{"startMs":2083839,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"15 years ago even i guess but if you"},{"startMs":2085440,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"look up in the daytime the sun kind of"},{"startMs":2087359,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"looks white"},{"startMs":2088399,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and then as it comes down you can see"},{"startMs":2090159,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"it's more yellow or orange and that's i"},{"startMs":2092399,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"think is the atmospheric conditions"},{"startMs":2093839,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"you've got more ozone protecting it so i"},{"startMs":2096320,"durationMs":3519,"subtitle":"just wonder if is there something"},{"startMs":2097760,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"showing that the sun is more extreme now"},{"startMs":2099839,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"than it was 20 years ago or is that more"},{"startMs":2101680,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"of like the ozone"},{"startMs":2103599,"durationMs":4721,"subtitle":"no there's there would be no change in"},{"startMs":2106800,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"energy output for instance i mean the"},{"startMs":2108320,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"changing the changing color of the sun"},{"startMs":2110640,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"is just to do with refraction angles at"},{"startMs":2112720,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"the time of day so you're viewing the"},{"startMs":2114720,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"light at more of an angle than you would"},{"startMs":2116480,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"at you know"},{"startMs":2118240,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"the height of the day i mean you guys"},{"startMs":2120160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"over here would get a lot more of that"},{"startMs":2121520,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"because there's more dust sand and you"},{"startMs":2124000,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"know uh if you were to observe the sun"},{"startMs":2126079,"durationMs":2801,"subtitle":"in"},{"startMs":2126880,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"the desert in the sahara desert say it"},{"startMs":2128880,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"look a lot redder because"},{"startMs":2130560,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"you know your your low atmosphere"},{"startMs":2132160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"components filled with more of that dust"},{"startMs":2134240,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"doesn't look that way for us in the uk"},{"startMs":2136000,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"okay because it's wet and rainy and"},{"startMs":2138320,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"right you know green for instance so"},{"startMs":2139920,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"none of that has on it is to do with the"},{"startMs":2142400,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"actual output of the sun which is you"},{"startMs":2144560,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"know uh remarkably constant over time"},{"startMs":2147359,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"you know so there's been very there's"},{"startMs":2148800,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"been no difference like over the

any"},{"startMs":2161040,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"anecdotal evidence of that leading to"},{"startMs":2163200,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"colder temperatures hasn't shown to be"},{"startMs":2166480,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"evidence you know the actual fusion"},{"startMs":2168240,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"output of the sun is not is not directly"},{"startMs":2170480,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"related to the field alignment so"},{"startMs":2173920,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"you know you can rely on the sun today"},{"startMs":2175599,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"as much as you could"},{"startMs":2177200,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"yesterday a thousand years ago to do its"},{"startMs":2179280,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"core job which is keep us warm i guess"},{"startMs":2181839,"durationMs":4881,"subtitle":"but and the finer scale details things"},{"startMs":2184160,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"can change but not in the macro"},{"startMs":2186720,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"microscopic scale if you will so like"},{"startMs":2188640,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"the nanometers type stuff is that would"},{"startMs":2190800,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"that change"},{"startMs":2192880,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"the spectrum spectrum doesn't change"},{"startMs":2194400,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"much at all and"},{"startMs":2196000,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"you know you can see during a grand"},{"startMs":2198640,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"solar minimum you can see somewhat of an"},{"startMs":2200720,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"increase in uv you also see a"},{"startMs":2203760,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"significant increase
