a"},{"startMs":311610,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"thousand times stronger than they are on"},{"startMs":313650,"durationMs":6269,"subtitle":"our planet and so there's a lot

what"},{"startMs":379740,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"you see in terms of the planets around"},{"startMs":381180,"durationMs":5370,"subtitle":"Jupiter and Saturn I think it's

you"},{"startMs":406949,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"know very complex planetary systems but"},{"startMs":410580,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"the question is whether we were part

definitively"},{"startMs":417449,"durationMs":4171,"subtitle":"prove it but there is some interesting"},{"startMs":419009,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"fingerprint evidence that suggests that"},{"startMs":421620,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"might be the case if we look at the"},{"startMs":423419,"durationMs":5011,"subtitle":"tilts you could argue that our till

got"},{"startMs":435150,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"captured by the Sun but our offset would"},{"startMs":437820,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"be the same for all those that end up"},{"startMs":439710,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"being captured by that system if we look"},{"startMs":443280,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"at the and we're going to talk about"},{"startMs":444630,"durationMs":4349,"subtitle":"that in a minute but the water and so"},{"startMs":447750,"durationMs":3419,"subtitle":"water comes in two different flavors"},{"startMs":448979,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"heavy water and light water and there's"},{"startMs":451169,"durationMs":4891,"subtitle":"a particular ratio of those which you"},{"startMs":452729,"durationMs":4591,"subtitle":"would expect to be the same across r1 no"},{"startMs":456060,"durationMs":2699,"subtitle":"not you wouldn't expect to be the same"},{"startMs":457320,"durationMs":3330,"subtitle":"across the solar system in fact what you"},{"startMs":458759,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"would expect is as you go further out"},{"startMs":460650,"durationMs":6870,"subtitle":"then actually you would see more of the"},{"startMs":463259,"durationMs":5701,"subtitle":"heavier water being present so then and"},{"startMs":467520,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"that's because it's colder there so you"},{"startMs":468960,"durationMs":5549,"subtitle":"sort of is able to survive longer than"},{"startMs":471720,"durationMs":4979,"subtitle":"it is out in that in the warmer region"},{"startMs":474509,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"but when we look at that we don't see"},{"startMs":476699,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"that and in fact interestingly enough"},{"startMs":478590,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"some our analysis of the rings around"},{"startMs":481469,"durationMs":6121,"subtitle":"Saturn provides the same fingerprint as"},{"startMs":484680,"durationMs":3410,"subtitle":"we do on earth which is kind of"},{"startMs":487590,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"interesting"},{"startMs":488090,"durationMs":7930,"subtitle":"now Phoebe which is what insides so we"},{"startMs":493080,"durationMs":5550,"subtitle":"if we if well let's just jump if I if I"},{"startMs":496020,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"jump all say if I jump forward and then"},{"startMs":498630,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"we'll come back to to where we are so"},{"startMs":501000,"durationMs":7110,"subtitle":"this is sort of an analysis of of the"},{"startMs":504330,"durationMs":5790,"subtitle":"heavy water ratios in the solar system"},{"startMs":508110,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"so again what we would expect to see as"},{"startMs":510120,"durationMs":3659,"subtitle":"you go further out is you have an"},{"startMs":511710,"durationMs":5699,"subtitle":"ever-increasing amount of this heavier"},{"startMs":513779,"durationMs":5791,"subtitle":"water and on earth you know you if we"},{"startMs":517409,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"test the oceans and we test you know"},{"startMs":519570,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"water that we find deep within the"},{"startMs":521339,"durationMs":5101,"subtitle":"mantle we find that same ratio it's"},{"startMs":523500,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"consistent across the planet"},{"startMs":526440,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"and you would expect as you go further"},{"startMs":527790,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"out for that ratio to change and in fact"},{"startMs":529740,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"when we look at Mars the ratio is"},{"startMs":531540,"durationMs":4470,"subtitle":"different on Mars than it is on earth"},{"startMs":533160,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"and then when we look at Saturn so in"},{"startMs":536010,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"the general analysis of Saturn in terms"},{"startMs":538320,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"of the water that we see within Saturn"},{"startMs":540420,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"itself is very different too so we sit"},{"startMs":544080,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"sort of here on that line in terms of"},{"startMs":545820,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"that ratio and Saturn sits well down but"},{"startMs":549210,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"interesting enough an analysis that they"},{"startMs":550770,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"did of some of the rings around Saturn"},{"startMs":553130,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"identified that the the ratio of some of"},{"startMs":555630,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"the water in the ring structure was"},{"startMs":559170,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"identical to earth so it had that"},{"startMs":561810,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"fingerprint rather than this fingerprint"},{"startMs":563700,"durationMs":3930,"subtitle":"what that means I'm I'm not entirely"},{"startMs":566010,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"sure because Saturn itself obviously"},{"startMs":567630,"durationMs":5970,"subtitle":"sits at a different ratio to Earth and"},{"startMs":570690,"durationMs":5610,"subtitle":"Mars as well you know if if we were all"},{"startMs":573600,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"part of Saturn well why would we not all"},{"startMs":576300,"durationMs":3330,"subtitle":"have the same thing and now personally I"},{"startMs":577920,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"think this this is a different"},{"startMs":579630,"durationMs":8940,"subtitle":"fingerprint which we'll come back in to"},{"startMs":581580,"durationMs":8910,"subtitle":"in in a second but for me there is loose"},{"startMs":588570,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"evidence to suggest that maybe we were"},{"startMs":590490,"durationMs":4910,"subtitle":"part of Saturn I think in terms of if"},{"startMs":593280,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"you look at the angle if you look at the"},{"startMs":595400,"durationMs":4210,"subtitle":"fingerprint of the water if you look at"},{"startMs":597990,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"the fact that Saturn's composition is"},{"startMs":599610,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"different to that of the the other gas"},{"startMs":601860,"durationMs":6330,"subtitle":"giants and the Sun it does suggest it"},{"startMs":604290,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"but for me it's not definitive at this"},{"startMs":608190,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"stage it's not definitively said that"},{"startMs":610230,"durationMs":3990,"subtitle":"absolutely then is that is the case I"},{"startMs":612360,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"would like to see more evidence that"},{"startMs":614220,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"underpins it but I certainly do believe"},{"startMs":616650,"durationMs":5850,"subtitle":"that these are examples of our stars or"},{"startMs":620310,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"potentially worse tower systems now"},{"startMs":622500,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"whether Jupiter was part of the Sun you"},{"startMs":625470,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"know maybe because certainly the angle"},{"startMs":627840,"durationMs":3570,"subtitle":"of the planet does indicate that but"},{"startMs":629580,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"that's not necessarily the be-all and"},{"startMs":631410,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"end-all the interesting thing is if we"},{"startMs":633780,"durationMs":6350,"subtitle":"look at the the amount of energy so when"},{"startMs":638250,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"we look at a planet obviously the Sun"},{"startMs":640130,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"heats the planets up so it absorbs a"},{"startMs":642900,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"certain amount of heat energy and and it"},{"startMs":645570,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"will radiate a certain amount so"},{"startMs":647010,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"generally speaking you would expect"},{"startMs":648510,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"that's to be less you would radiate less"},{"startMs":651180,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"than you receive"},{"startMs":652860,"durationMs":3570,"subtitle":"Jupiter Saturn and Neptune radiate
