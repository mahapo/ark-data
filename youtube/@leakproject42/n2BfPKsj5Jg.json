actually"},{"startMs":462060,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"going on so at the moment that's how"},{"startMs":463950,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"they determine it they look at

most"},{"startMs":2712470,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"interesting ones obviously was the fact"},{"startMs":2714930,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"that they were able to transmit

actually"},{"startMs":2766190,"durationMs":3970,"subtitle":"transmute eight elements then when we"},{"startMs":2768450,"durationMs":3270,"subtitle":"look at those fingerprints that's very"},{"startMs":2770160,"durationMs":4050,"subtitle":"much dependent if we look at the"},{"startMs":2771720,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"Sapphire results on what is in
