a"},{"startMs":315419,"durationMs":6121,"subtitle":"what a change from what the perception"},{"startMs":318419,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"is yeah but it's even more subtle

or"},{"startMs":887220,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"would it be something no okay no we know"},{"startMs":891060,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"of all the planetary bodies nearby and"},{"startMs":892740,"durationMs":2839,"subtitle":"they've always been there"},{"startMs":896339,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"the reduction in field strength is"},{"startMs":898139,"durationMs":3541,"subtitle":"causing this to happen"},{"startMs":899820,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"so if you reduce the field

one"},{"startMs":981120,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"podcast we did a while back where you"},{"startMs":983519,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"were showing the"},{"startMs":985800,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"um the rise of"},{"startMs":987899,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"is it Homo sapiens and or and the 400 it"},{"startMs":991440,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"was like 400 something thousand years"},{"startMs":992459,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"ago but it was connected to a

at"},{"startMs":999060,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"41 500 years ago"},{"startMs":1001279,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"maybe that was it yeah and that's during"},{"startMs":1003440,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"the largest magnetic Excursion in in"},{"startMs":1006199,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"recent geologic time it's the

and"},{"startMs":1018680,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"many other species as well and then it"},{"startMs":1021079,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"seems like after that point Homo

rule the planet"},{"startMs":1031819,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"now what's interesting about that if we"},{"startMs":1033620,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"want to go into some esoteric stuff"},{"startMs":1036079,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"is that the next mass extinction doesn't"},{"startMs":1039380,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"happen until the younger driest 12 900"},{"startMs":1042679,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"years ago that gives humans the longest"},{"startMs":1046040,"durationMs":5519,"subtitle":"period of time ever known to

and"},{"startMs":1053660,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"you can see how high our technology is"},{"startMs":1056000,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"currently but back then they had 30"},{"startMs":1059900,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"000 years"},{"startMs":1063020,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"that's three times the amount that we"},{"startMs":1066260,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"have currently so what kind of"},{"startMs":1067700,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"Technologies could they have developed"},{"startMs":1071240,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"yeah and you said you're right and I can"},{"startMs":1074360,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"only imagine let me guess because right"},{"startMs":1076940,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"after that mass extinction you know the"},{"startMs":1078980,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"the lashamp Excursion where we became"},{"startMs":1081440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"king you one of your earliest podcasts"},{"startMs":1083900,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"which has like a million views is that"},{"startMs":1085760,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"Lion Man statue yeah that's like 40 000"},{"startMs":1090080,"durationMs":6599,"subtitle":"years ago yep and it looks just like any"},{"startMs":1093740,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"carving we would make today so we were"},{"startMs":1096679,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"as advanced as we ever were starting at"},{"startMs":1099380,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"that point and then we had 30 000 years"},{"startMs":1101900,"durationMs":5159,"subtitle":"to create those megalithic

world"},{"startMs":1109100,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"what kind of technology did we have"},{"startMs":1111679,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"yeah right and you've got me you said"},{"startMs":1113600,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"like 40 000 years and then you brought"},{"startMs":1115520,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"up another cycle of the younger drives"},{"startMs":1117200,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"by 12 000 years ago so if you do the"},{"startMs":1119240,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"math on that that's approximately 28 000"},{"startMs":1121160,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"years give or take a few years you've"},{"startMs":1123080,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"got a great year because a great year is"},{"startMs":1124640,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"26 000 something years is it not yeah 25"},{"startMs":1128660,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"9 is the exact number but yeah so that's"},{"startMs":1131780,"durationMs":5279,"subtitle":"quite interesting how close"},{"startMs":1133820,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"within a 10 differential there"},{"startMs":1137059,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"um yeah and then that 41 000 year old"},{"startMs":1139220,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"date has moved it was 42 000 years ago"},{"startMs":1142880,"durationMs":3659,"subtitle":"and then some new dating comes in and"},{"startMs":1144500,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"it's getting a little closer so that"},{"startMs":1146539,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"date can move"},{"startMs":1148880,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"you know it's plus or minus something so"},{"startMs":1151220,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"it could actually be the per a perfect"},{"startMs":1153320,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"great year"},{"startMs":1155179,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"you know and you've been doing a lot of"},{"startMs":1157039,"durationMs":3541,"subtitle":"podcasts recently that'd be cool and"},{"startMs":1158660,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"guess Rex guess when the next magnetic"},{"startMs":1160580,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"Excursion is before 41 000. in like 20"},{"startMs":1164780,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"30 or something I don't know when is it"},{"startMs":1166400,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"it's 26 000 years later the

years"},{"startMs":1173900,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"ago oh oh okay I see what you're saying"},{"startMs":1175880,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"I'm sorry I misunderstood you yeah"},{"startMs":1178520,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"so there's a 26 000 year pattern here"},{"startMs":1181580,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"of magnetic Excursion yes"},{"startMs":1184580,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"maybe that's why these great years are"},{"startMs":1186860,"durationMs":2819,"subtitle":"so important maybe that's why the

rise"},{"startMs":1200299,"durationMs":5821,"subtitle":"above or you're going to fall and"},{"startMs":1203480,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"um in this time of this great change uh"},{"startMs":1206120,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"warnings build prepare you know have"},{"startMs":1207860,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"your civilization get ready because"},{"startMs":1208940,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"there's been many civilizations before"},{"startMs":1210260,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"that failed you know when you go back
