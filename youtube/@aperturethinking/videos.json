Droves of brainwashed people marched through an apocalyptic world. Some might have recognized it for being reminiscent of George Orwell’s popular novel, 1984. Talk about impeccable timing. \n\nIn this ad, the inspirational spark that would set these people free was something new, something different - Macintosh computers, freeing the brainwashed minds from IBM’s ubiquitous personal computers. The ad challenged the world to ‘Think Different’, Apple’s slogan that would define the brand in the coming decades. \n\nIf you watched the Super Bowl in 2023, you might have come across this ad from a company that seems to be in a position similar to Apple in 1984. The company, just like Apple, is in a position where it’s coming up against a giant in the industry. The ad, like Apple’s 1984, was designed to get customers to challenge the status quo. The ad featured the tagline “shop like a billionaires” and showcased high quality items at a price most would consider almost impossible. \n\nThis is how #temu 's Super Bowl Ad is disrupting an entire industry. \n\n#shoptemu #temustyle #temubaes\n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5_OI17b6vk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5_OI17b6vk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5_OI17b6vk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5_OI17b6vk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5_OI17b6vk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":101,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"C5_OI17b6vk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fbQaXyFL5pgtBAgCrTN4Bf8pT7U","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLnJLU3VBdlp2WDhZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-01-14T17:30:10Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"How to make 2024 the best year of your life","description":"Go to https://brilliant.org/APERTURE to get a 30-day free trial + the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nNew Year’s resolutions.

You grow fond of some more than others, but generally, you’re having a good time. That is until your lovers start to fall ill and die. For some reason, this disease doesn’t affect you, it just kills off your sexual partners. Today, it’s easy for us to think it’s probably a sexually transmitted disease, but before our modern understanding of sexual health or science in general, your theories of what’s killing your lovers may take on wild shapes and forms. In 3000 BCE, King Minos, the ruler of Knossos, and his mistresses had this very problem. It was believed that the King had snakes and scorpions in his semen, and that’s what was killing his mistresses. He wanted to prevent his wife, Pasiphae, from meeting the same fate. And so, a goat bladder was introduced to protect them both during intercourse. And according to the limited historical resources of the time, it worked. Pasiphae lived, and the invention of the condom was born; at least, our first known record of it. The condom might seem common today, but it truly changed humanity. It has been critical in preventing the spread of diseases and unwanted pregnancies. \n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":122,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eFz85CIsQaY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"zVwoF7SzUJzIMs5jJ8uLkYcV0LU","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjlvRTFNYkc5UVpV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-27T20:58:09Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"The Dark Side of Social Media","description":"Social media has allowed us to connect with each other no matter who we are or where we are located.

Or you were so focused on an upcoming project that you totally forgot to wish your coworker congratulations on their promotion? It happens to the best of us. Most of us are wired to be a little selfish. We evolved to survive, after all. Airlines even tell us to secure our oxygen masks before our children’s.

From stoicism, to nihilism, to absurdism, there are many different schools of thought trying to teach us how to think, act, and tell right from wrong. But have you ever felt that philosophy is sometimes a bit too elaborate? Too structural? Since written records began, philosophers have produced mountains of text, but how much of it really connects with us? Some of it does, definitely. Descartes’ “I think therefore I am” is one of the most beautiful realizations you can have. It is so concise yet so beautifully self-evident. On the other hand, how many of us spend our days thinking about the form of a table or its corresponding “table-hood” like Plato? How many of us use Parmenides' argument against motion in our daily lives?\n\nRead the story: https://whatifshow.com/craziest-philosophers/\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":127,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zUdw_Durdos"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"UdyO4mKH4TLc6w853J0Irv8-mk4","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjBBQ2lsZWtaVXJ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-06T19:47:29Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"Everything You Need To Know About Stoicism.","description":"Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that aims to take us from being vulnerable to the chaotic nature of the Universe to being calm and indifferent to it. It’s a way to fortify yourself for lasting peace of mind. But as with every practice that involves changing your attitude or disposition, work is involved and, often, sacrifice. The stoic’s work is to recognize what’s in our control and what isn’t. And the only thing in our control is our reaction to what happens, not the event itself. Obviously, we can influence what happens, but nothing is entirely in our control.

In the case of a restless night, the more you think about your desire to fall asleep, the less likely you are to fall asleep. When your mind is elsewhere, not directly striving to achieve your intended goal, that is when you finally get some rest. It’s funny how this works because it seems paradoxical. Why do our wants come directly to us when we give up and let go? Alan Watts was an English-born pop philosopher who is widely attributed to the backwards law. But Watts didn’t invent the phenomenon; neither was he the first to recognize it. In fact, he got the idea from Zen Buddhism. For Buddhists, desire and ignorance are at the heart of all worldly suffering.

No one ever sees physical illness and thinks, “I want that for myself.” So why’s it different with mental illness? The reality is that your perception of mental health warps how you view your own. And if it’s culturally acceptable to joke about or aestheticize mental illness, it might become an alluring, sexy or desirable condition to have.

Afterwards this person confronts you, claiming they had mentioned this same solution to you during a private call last week, accusing you of intellectual theft.\n\nStay connected with Aperture: \nWebsite: https://aperture.gg/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theapertureyt/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheApertureYT \n\nCheck out our other channels: \nWhat If: https://bit.ly/youtube-What-If \nHow to Survive: https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-show \nCrazy Creatures: https://bit.ly/crazy-creatures-show \nYour Body On: https://bit.ly/your-body-on-show \nOrigins of Food: https://bit.ly/origins-of-food \nVersus: https://bit.ly/versus-show \nWTF Did I Just Watch: https://bit.ly/wtf-did-i-just-watch \n\nQuestions or concerns?

If you collect vinyl records or just happen to still have CDs laying around, then you do. But the majority of us in 2023 rely on subscription services like Spotify or Apple Music to borrow the music we enjoy. What about the movies you watch? Well, thanks to the access we have to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, very few of us feel the need to own DVD or VHS tapes anymore and have instead become borrowers of the movies we watch as well.\n\nYou might think these are just subscription models, but what about the games you buy from Steam, the PlayStation store or the Xbox Store, do you own those games? Or do you just own access to those games? If you own it, shouldn’t you be able to resell, lease, or even borrow it to someone else? These are just a few examples of how big tech has created a business model that has almost entirely erased personal ownership. And entertainment is just the beginning. \n\nStay connected with Aperture: \nWebsite: https://aperture.gg/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theapertureyt/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheApertureYT \n\nCheck out our other channels: \nWhat If: https://bit.ly/youtube-What-If \nHow to Survive: https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-show \nCrazy Creatures: https://bit.ly/crazy-creatures-show \nYour Body On: https://bit.ly/your-body-on-show \nOrigins of Food: https://bit.ly/origins-of-food \nVersus: https://bit.ly/versus-show \nWTF Did I Just Watch: https://bit.ly/wtf-did-i-just-watch \n\nQuestions or concerns?

In the words of George Gerbner, “Commercial media has eclipsed religion, art, oral traditions and the family as the great storytelling engine of our time. And whoever tells the stories of culture gets to govern human behavior.” \n\nAnd therein lies the biggest problem with commercial storytelling.

Well first, the AI would attempt to gain access to as many technological systems as possible. Then, it’d study us, gathering data and identifying our weaknesses. Next, it would execute various strategies to disrupt human society including sabotaging infrastructure and spreading propaganda. This would be implemented alongside the creation and deployment of a robot army capable of launching attacks around the globe. Finally, once humanity was successfully subjugated, the AI would establish a new world order in which it controlled every facet of our lives.\n\nStay connected with Aperture: \nWebsite: https://aperture.gg/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theapertureyt/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheApertureYT \n\nCheck out our other channels: \nWhat If: https://bit.ly/youtube-What-If \nHow to Survive: https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-show \nCrazy Creatures: https://bit.ly/crazy-creatures-show \nYour Body On: https://bit.ly/your-body-on-show \nOrigins of Food: https://bit.ly/origins-of-food \nVersus: https://bit.ly/versus-show \nWTF Did I Just Watch: https://bit.ly/wtf-did-i-just-watch \n\nQuestions or concerns?
