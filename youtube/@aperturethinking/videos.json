A helpful tool or a stressful mandate that society seems to expect of us every year? Probably both. If you’re like me, you think about making a list of what you want to accomplish or the type of person you want to become when the clock strikes midnight, but, usually, that list never makes it onto a piece of paper. \n\nWe’ve been told that a new year is a perfect opportunity to start our next chapter. To kickstart our health, our relationships, our careers. It can feel overwhelming. We expect something of ourselves. \n\nBut let’s take the pressure off for a second. Instead of forcing ourselves to suddenly become enlightened and successful beyond our wildest dreams, can we break down our approach to a new year? \n\nHere’s how we can all conquer 2024. \n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rKSuAvZvX8Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rKSuAvZvX8Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rKSuAvZvX8Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rKSuAvZvX8Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rKSuAvZvX8Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rKSuAvZvX8Y"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"hPvVpKpQPU9tFQq3Zz8CI69ZnS8","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLmJuN1JzOWpnSVp3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-01-12T19:18:02Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"Best Self-Improvement Tips for 2024","description":"Support this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT/about\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\n\nSubscribe to this channel: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring this channel?

You grow fond of some more than others, but generally, you’re having a good time. That is until your lovers start to fall ill and die. For some reason, this disease doesn’t affect you, it just kills off your sexual partners. Today, it’s easy for us to think it’s probably a sexually transmitted disease, but before our modern understanding of sexual health or science in general, your theories of what’s killing your lovers may take on wild shapes and forms. In 3000 BCE, King Minos, the ruler of Knossos, and his mistresses had this very problem. It was believed that the King had snakes and scorpions in his semen, and that’s what was killing his mistresses. He wanted to prevent his wife, Pasiphae, from meeting the same fate. And so, a goat bladder was introduced to protect them both during intercourse. And according to the limited historical resources of the time, it worked. Pasiphae lived, and the invention of the condom was born; at least, our first known record of it. The condom might seem common today, but it truly changed humanity. It has been critical in preventing the spread of diseases and unwanted pregnancies. \n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFz85CIsQaY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":21,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eFz85CIsQaY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"bHCMZRSJiNROAUKpnqkJQ9aXZOo","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjlvRTFNYkc5UVpV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-27T20:58:09Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"The Dark Side of Social Media","description":"Social media has allowed us to connect with each other no matter who we are or where we are located.

We’re both haunted by the past and dreading the future. But the truth is that the future and the past don’t exist. We might think that the past and the future are as real as the present, but that’s the illusion of time. In reality, the present is the only thing that exists. A clock tracks movement, like the rotation of Earth and our orbit around the Sun. But its measurement of time isn’t objective. There is only the present, and its direction is forward.\n\nRead the story: https://whatifshow.com/alan-watts-time-illusion/\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPvxn9M0d9Y/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPvxn9M0d9Y/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPvxn9M0d9Y/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPvxn9M0d9Y/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPvxn9M0d9Y/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":23,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qPvxn9M0d9Y"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HnFyjz1iTcvLp63YuhYRuFRqP_8","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjFFRHhrYmdiamRv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-22T16:00:00Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"Nothing is Real","description":"The first 100 people to use code APERTURE with the link below will get 60% off of Incogni: http://incogni.com/aperture\n\nHas anyone ever accused you of acting like you’re the center of the universe? Maybe you were 10 years old, upset that your mom wouldn’t take you to buy candy. Or you were so focused on an upcoming project that you totally forgot to wish your coworker congratulations on their promotion? It happens to the best of us. Most of us are wired to be a little selfish. We evolved to survive, after all. Airlines even tell us to secure our oxygen masks before our children’s. But being reprimanded by our parents or a friend for being a little self-obsessed is different from feeling like we are truly the only person who exists. What would that be like? Everyone and everything else being a figment of our imagination? Actually being the center of the universe? It seems like a fun ‘what if’ game to play, but if you think about it long enough… could it make sense? Are sure the phone you’re holding in your hands is real? Can you be certain that the woman you just bought a coffee from was indeed there? \n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EDxkbgbjdo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EDxkbgbjdo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EDxkbgbjdo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EDxkbgbjdo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EDxkbgbjdo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":24,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1EDxkbgbjdo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"grll-yqPwL3fWZDEOvDAD0qBkOY","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjFkVFRrbldnb1pr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-21T22:56:25Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"The Desire to Not Exist","description":"If you’re struggling, consider therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp.

From stoicism, to nihilism, to absurdism, there are many different schools of thought trying to teach us how to think, act, and tell right from wrong. But have you ever felt that philosophy is sometimes a bit too elaborate? Too structural? Since written records began, philosophers have produced mountains of text, but how much of it really connects with us? Some of it does, definitely. Descartes’ “I think therefore I am” is one of the most beautiful realizations you can have. It is so concise yet so beautifully self-evident. On the other hand, how many of us spend our days thinking about the form of a table or its corresponding “table-hood” like Plato? How many of us use Parmenides' argument against motion in our daily lives?\n\nRead the story: https://whatifshow.com/craziest-philosophers/\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\n\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring Aperture?  inquiries@underknown.com","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUdw_Durdos/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Aperture","playlistId":"UUO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","position":26,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"zUdw_Durdos"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Aperture","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"00pbuN9EixnKcIAnkEQk-uZ0rqo","id":"VVVPNVFTb0VTNXluMkR3N1lpeERZVDVRLjBBQ2lsZWtaVXJ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-06T19:47:29Z","channelId":"UCO5QSoES5yn2Dw7YixDYT5Q","title":"Everything You Need To Know About Stoicism.","description":"Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that aims to take us from being vulnerable to the chaotic nature of the Universe to being calm and indifferent to it. It’s a way to fortify yourself for lasting peace of mind. But as with every practice that involves changing your attitude or disposition, work is involved and, often, sacrifice. The stoic’s work is to recognize what’s in our control and what isn’t. And the only thing in our control is our reaction to what happens, not the event itself. Obviously, we can influence what happens, but nothing is entirely in our control. Misfortunes are unpredictable and often inevitable. \n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ApertureYT/about\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/YHtd5Ufn\nShop: https://bit.ly/ApertureMerch\n\nSubscribe to this channel: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToAperture\nQuestions or concerns? https://underknown.com/contact/\nInterested in sponsoring this channel?

In the case of a restless night, the more you think about your desire to fall asleep, the less likely you are to fall asleep. When your mind is elsewhere, not directly striving to achieve your intended goal, that is when you finally get some rest. It’s funny how this works because it seems paradoxical. Why do our wants come directly to us when we give up and let go? Alan Watts was an English-born pop philosopher who is widely attributed to the backwards law. But Watts didn’t invent the phenomenon; neither was he the first to recognize it. In fact, he got the idea from Zen Buddhism. For Buddhists, desire and ignorance are at the heart of all worldly suffering.

If you collect vinyl records or just happen to still have CDs laying around, then you do. But the majority of us in 2023 rely on subscription services like Spotify or Apple Music to borrow the music we enjoy. What about the movies you watch? Well, thanks to the access we have to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, very few of us feel the need to own DVD or VHS tapes anymore and have instead become borrowers of the movies we watch as well.\n\nYou might think these are just subscription models, but what about the games you buy from Steam, the PlayStation store or the Xbox Store, do you own those games? Or do you just own access to those games? If you own it, shouldn’t you be able to resell, lease, or even borrow it to someone else? These are just a few examples of how big tech has created a business model that has almost entirely erased personal ownership.

Yet, he was given an 11-year sentence, with six of those years to be served behind bars and the remaining five under extended supervision.\n\nStay connected with Aperture: \nWebsite: https://aperture.gg/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theapertureyt/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheApertureYT \n\nCheck out our other channels: \nWhat If: https://bit.ly/youtube-What-If \nHow to Survive: https://bit.ly/how-to-survive-show \nCrazy Creatures: https://bit.ly/crazy-creatures-show \nYour Body On: https://bit.ly/your-body-on-show \nOrigins of Food: https://bit.ly/origins-of-food \nVersus: https://bit.ly/versus-show \nWTF Did I Just Watch: https://bit.ly/wtf-did-i-just-watch \n\nQuestions or concerns?

In the words of George Gerbner, “Commercial media has eclipsed religion, art, oral traditions and the family as the great storytelling engine of our time. And whoever tells the stories of culture gets to govern human behavior.” \n\nAnd therein lies the biggest problem with commercial storytelling. Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, all the different news apps and websites, how many times do we check the news on our phones every day? In the past, it took weeks, months or even years to hear bad news from the other side of the world. But today, we have everything at our fingertips.
