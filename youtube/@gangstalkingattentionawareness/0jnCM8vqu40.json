way"},{"startMs":232720,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"ways show up in the creative states etc"},{"startMs":235120,"durationMs":2479,"subtitle":"so by looking at these different waves"},{"startMs":236480,"durationMs":2319,"subtitle":"and where they're at in the brain"},{"startMs":237599,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"you're able to get a better idea

it's"},{"startMs":1686000,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"actually have this application running"},{"startMs":1687279,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"here"},{"startMs":1688000,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and all i have to do is select the uh"},{"startMs":1690720,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"we'll say lift"},{"startMs":1692320,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"and i've already trained gone through"},{"startMs":1693520,"durationMs":2159,"subtitle":"the training process for this now if i"},{"startMs":1695120,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"think"},{"startMs":1695679,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"lift which i'm not very good at but you"},{"startMs":1698480,"durationMs":2559,"subtitle":"saw it blink there a couple times and"},{"startMs":1699840,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"for me i think

it's"},{"startMs":1704480,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"not working now"},{"startMs":1705360,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"but if i stop talking and think about it"},{"startMs":1707279,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"i can make the lift show up again"},{"startMs":1711760,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"there we go and um now it's showing up"},{"startMs":1714799,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"just to show off"},{"startMs":1715840,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"anyway so the process is that you go"},{"startMs":1718159,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"through a training process where you"},{"startMs":1719840,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"train for these different commands to"},{"startMs":1722799,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"recognize"},{"startMs":1723520,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"what that mental image looks like in"},{"startMs":1725279,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"your brain okay so for me i think of a"},{"startMs":1727520,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"red

plane"},{"startMs":1732960,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"and those things all together see there"},{"startMs":1734640,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"go it popped up again says lift"},{"startMs":1736559,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"then those things all together is what i"},{"startMs":1738080,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"use to create the mental image"},{"startMs":1739760,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"in my brain for lift and so then when i"},{"startMs":1742960,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"connect this to the quadcopter over here"},{"startMs":1744960,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"then it will fly the quadcopter now"},{"startMs":1747120,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"these buttons in the middle here are"},{"startMs":1748399,"durationMs":2321,"subtitle":"because occasionally when i'm flying the"},{"startMs":1749760,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"quadcopter"},{"startMs":1750720,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"it starts to drift into the audience

to"},{"startMs":1783600,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"connect the quadcopter now"},{"startMs":1785679,"durationMs":3281,"subtitle":"so you'll watch the quadcopter i'm going"},{"startMs":1787520,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"to tap this button here in the block up"},{"startMs":1788960,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"you're going to lift a few feet off the"},{"startMs":1790000,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"ground"},{"startMs":1790960,"durationMs":2719,"subtitle":"and then she's going to be able to make"},{"startMs":1792240,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"it go higher so it's going to three feet"},{"startMs":1793679,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"up and hover and you can make it go"},{"startMs":1795039,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"higher"},{"startMs":1795679,"durationMs":3041,"subtitle":"or rotate to the right"},{"startMs":1803200,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"all right so

that"},{"startMs":2121680,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"all right so let's train it for rotate"},{"startMs":2122960,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"right so there was a university that

rotate"},{"startMs":2148800,"durationMs":3039,"subtitle":"right now think about lift"},{"startMs":2153440,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"that's rotate right so i found"},{"startMs":2156960,"durationMs":2399,"subtitle":"especially like with opposites like left"},{"startMs":2158720,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"and right"},{"startMs":2159359,"durationMs":2561,"subtitle":"then we think about left and then we"},{"startMs":2160640,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"think right oh right it's the

train"},{"startMs":2168640,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"let's train for lift again okay"},{"startMs":2170400,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"just start with a new thought for lift"},{"startMs":2172000,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"sure okay with anything for lift"},{"startMs":2174880,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"all right so lift up up and away"},{"startMs":2184160,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"there we go that's a good lift can i"},{"startMs":2186240,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"think about rotating right"},{"startMs":2191760,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"that's left oh there you go rotate right"},{"startMs":2193359,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"okay let's try it"},{"startMs":2195040,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"you ready to try go uh i'm ready for"},{"startMs":2196800,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"lift yeah okay"},{"startMs":2201280,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"so go ahead and lift it up a little bit"},{"startMs":2202560,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and see how high we can if we can get it"},{"startMs":2203760,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"high enough"},{"startMs":2207359,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"there you go he's lifting it up"},{"startMs":2211359,"durationMs":5681,"subtitle":"actually go ahead and hit the ceiling if"},{"startMs":2212480,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"you want to as high as you can get

go"},{"startMs":2227520,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"hey you got the ceiling okay"},{"startMs":2231920,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"i'll land it now"},{"startMs":2234960,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"all right now we'll take off again and"},{"startMs":2236640,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"then we'll do both okay"},{"startMs":2240839,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":2244800,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"so go ahead and bring it up a little bit"},{"startMs":2247920,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"there you go and now rotate to the right"},{"startMs":2253760,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"there you go rotating to the right"},{"startMs":2256240,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"rotate some more"},{"startMs":2262240,"durationMs":9599,"subtitle":"i know you're doing all the hard work

let's"},{"startMs":2293920,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"try"},{"startMs":2295440,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"um something different what would you"},{"startMs":2296720,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"like to try next i'll let you choose"},{"startMs":2298960,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"like in terms of a vision or controlling"},{"startMs":2301119,"durationMs":1841,"subtitle":"how you want to what do you want to"},{"startMs":2302000,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"control"},{"startMs":2302960,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"forward all right so that's going to
