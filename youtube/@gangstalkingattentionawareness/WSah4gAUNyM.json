wave"},{"startMs":222000,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"patterns are red and see this we have"},{"startMs":223739,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"the idea of a different gamma beta uh"},{"startMs":225959,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"Theta Delta Etc so some waves are more"},{"startMs":229739,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"conducive or show up when you're"},{"startMs":231659,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"meditative States other way ways show up"},{"startMs":233519,"durationMs":3421,"subtitle":"in the creative States Etc so by looking"},{"startMs":235860,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"at these different waves and where"},{"startMs":236940,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"they're at in the brain you're able to"},{"startMs":238200,"durationMs":2759,"subtitle":"get a better idea of what's going on in"},{"startMs":239580,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"the brain the other thing that we look"},{"startMs":240959,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"at in the brain is hemodynamics which is"},{"startMs":243000,"durationMs":3599,"subtitle":"blood flow where is the blood at in the"},{"startMs":244620,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"brain so by knowing what parts of the"},{"startMs":246599,"durationMs":4981,"subtitle":"brain are working on certain parts what"},{"startMs":249720,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"have certain responsibilities"},{"startMs":251580,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"by telling where the blood is at we can"},{"startMs":253560,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"tell if it's what's going on in your"},{"startMs":255540,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"brain so this example here talks about"},{"startMs":257280,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"looking at where the blood's at in your"},{"startMs":258780,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"brain to see if it's a lie or truth and"},{"startMs":260639,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"so an example I can explain for this is"},{"startMs":263400,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"that if you're accessing the memory"},{"startMs":266040,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"portions of your brain when you're asked"},{"startMs":267540,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"a question then you're more likely"},{"startMs":270120,"durationMs":2579,"subtitle":"telling the truth because you're going"},{"startMs":271440,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"back and remembering something that"},{"startMs":272699,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"happened but if instead you're accessing"},{"startMs":274380,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"the creative portions of your brain then"},{"startMs":276360,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"that could indicate that you are lying"},{"startMs":279540,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"and that of course brings us to our"},{"startMs":281040,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"first idea of brain computer interfaces"},{"startMs":283259,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"which is the polygraph the polygraph

state"},{"startMs":305940,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and so this is the concept that we're"},{"startMs":308759,"durationMs":3241,"subtitle":"all been familiar with over the years"},{"startMs":309960,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"that our brain has external"},{"startMs":312000,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"manifestations that are outside of our"},{"startMs":313620,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"control so by looking for changes in"},{"startMs":316500,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"these different states they're able to"},{"startMs":317940,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"determine if you're lying or not now the"},{"startMs":319620,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"reality is the polygraph really tells if"},{"startMs":321960,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"you are stressed or not stressed and so"},{"startMs":325440,"durationMs":4979,"subtitle":"that indication of stress could be an"},{"startMs":328080,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"indication of lying but not always the"},{"startMs":330419,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"case so uh polygraphs do

gonna"},{"startMs":1783740,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"connect the quadcopter now"},{"startMs":1785659,"durationMs":3541,"subtitle":"so you'll watch the quadcopter I'm

higher"},{"startMs":1816080,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"there it goes lift good job"},{"startMs":1819740,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"higher still so I need to get it"},{"startMs":1825260,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"oh there it goes"},{"startMs":1828320,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"oh it's too close to me so I'm

everything"},{"startMs":1869720,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"this is going to connect to the headset"},{"startMs":1872659,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and then connect to the quadcopter"},{"startMs":1875240,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and send the information back and forth"},{"startMs":1877399,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and I have another app actually that"},{"startMs":1879080,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"Chris has running on Google last year"},{"startMs":1881419,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"that I'm gonna bring up here as

so"},{"startMs":1915799,"durationMs":3301,"subtitle":"the first thing we'll do is we're going"},{"startMs":1916700,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"to train this to get a mental image

so"},{"startMs":1922580,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"the first training we're going to do is"},{"startMs":1925640,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"um neutral this is just to get a"},{"startMs":1927919,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"baseline for your brain okay so just"},{"startMs":1930159,"durationMs":5281,"subtitle":"neutral thoughts no pressure at this"},{"startMs":1933320,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"point"},{"startMs":1938659,"durationMs":2941,"subtitle":"okay so now we've got a baseline for"},{"startMs":1940520,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"your brain so now we're going to train"},{"startMs":1941600,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"it to rotate right so Rotator is going"},{"startMs":1943460,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"to cause the quadcopter to just rotate"},{"startMs":1944960,"durationMs":2099,"subtitle":"to the right"},{"startMs":1945860,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":1947059,"durationMs":4021,"subtitle":"um what I found works really good is not"},{"startMs":1949159,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"to move but just to think about"},{"startMs":1951080,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"something that you associate with"},{"startMs":1952520,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"rotating right so it's important to"},{"startMs":1954799,"durationMs":3181,"subtitle":"include as much of your brain as this as"},{"startMs":1956360,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"possible but the most important thing is"},{"startMs":1957980,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"it's reproducible okay okay so whatever"},{"startMs":1960740,"durationMs":3179,"subtitle":"you can reproduce that you can associate"},{"startMs":1963020,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"with rotating right that's what we're"},{"startMs":1963919,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"going to do all right you ready all"},{"startMs":1966200,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"right so"},{"startMs":1967820,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"we're training for rotate right now"},{"startMs":1976760,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":1977899,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"so now go ahead and think rotate right"},{"startMs":1979880,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"and we'll see if this bar graph shows"},{"startMs":1981919,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"anything there we go see it's picking up"},{"startMs":1983840,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"your thoughts to rotate right that's"},{"startMs":1985580,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"good that's really good so now I'm going"},{"startMs":1987559,"durationMs":2821,"subtitle":"to tap this button here and connect to"},{"startMs":1989000,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"the quadcopter"},{"startMs":1990380,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"and the quadcopter is going to pick up"},{"startMs":1991820,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"about three feet off the

hover"},{"startMs":2005019,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"and at that point Chris is going to be"},{"startMs":2006220,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"in control and make rotate right"},{"startMs":2008679,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"so if it rotate right everybody can clap"},{"startMs":2010779,"durationMs":5481,"subtitle":"and Applause and share for Chris here so"},{"startMs":2013000,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"here we go here it's taken off"},{"startMs":2016419,"durationMs":4041,"subtitle":"all right so now go ahead and think"},{"startMs":2017559,"durationMs":2901,"subtitle":"about rotating right Chris"},{"startMs":2021700,"durationMs":2790,"subtitle":"there we go that's Chris right there"},{"startMs":2023019,"durationMs":6241,"subtitle":"rotating it right"},{"startMs":2024490,"durationMs":6450,"subtitle":"[Applause]"},{"startMs":2029260,"durationMs":2759,"subtitle":"all right and so much I got controls"},{"startMs":2030940,"durationMs":2459,"subtitle":"here too so I can keep it from running"},{"startMs":2032019,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"out in the audience and hurting somebody"},{"startMs":2033399,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"although it's got plastic rotors so it's"},{"startMs":2035620,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"not going to kill anybody"},{"startMs":2037720,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"um all right so next would it trade it"},{"startMs":2039340,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"for Lift going up sound good sure okay"},{"startMs":2042820,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"so for me I think of uh either a red"},{"startMs":2045880,"durationMs":2759,"subtitle":"balloon the image of red balloon"},{"startMs":2047260,"durationMs":3419,"subtitle":"disappearing or I think it's a bird it's"},{"startMs":2048639,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"a planet Superman or I think about being"},{"startMs":2050679,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"on an airplane as it lifts off okay so"},{"startMs":2052960,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"whatever works for you though is great"},{"startMs":2058780,"durationMs":3139,"subtitle":"all right so we're training now"},{"startMs":2068919,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"there you go so think lift again and see"},{"startMs":2070839,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"if that bar shows up for us"},{"startMs":2075099,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"okay so oh there we go it throw it up"},{"startMs":2077200,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"let's do it one more time so the more"},{"startMs":2078760,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"the more uh things we're trying to"},{"startMs":2080560,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"distinguish between it actually gets"},{"startMs":2081639,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"more difficult so it's okay to we're"},{"startMs":2083919,"durationMs":5061,"subtitle":"gonna do this one more time here so"},{"startMs":2085480,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"we'll hit train we're thinking lift"},{"startMs":2094240,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"okay there we go that's good nice Strong"},{"startMs":2095980,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"Lift now think rotate right again see if"},{"startMs":2097780,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"we can do that one"},{"startMs":2101200,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"okay let's lift can you rotate right"},{"startMs":2103420,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"that was lift"},{"startMs":2104980,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"that was really right sorry so it's"},{"startMs":2107800,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"actually the it's we're not only"},{"startMs":2109780,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"training the Drone or the software to"},{"startMs":2111760,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"recognize the brain patterns but"},{"startMs":2113260,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"training our brain to think about"},{"startMs":2114700,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"specific things because our brain likes"},{"startMs":2116680,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"to think about lots of stuff and so"},{"startMs":2118480,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"let's try rotate right again think about"},{"startMs":2119800,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"that"},{"startMs":2121720,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"all right so let's train it for rotate"},{"startMs":2123099,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"right"},{"startMs":2124240,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"so there was a university that did this"},{"startMs":2125980,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"with a full clinical EEG which had like"},{"startMs":2128500,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"four times as many electrodes and they"},{"startMs":2130359,"durationMs":2881,"subtitle":"said it took about 40 hours to get to"},{"startMs":2132160,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"the point they could control a"},{"startMs":2133240,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"quadcopter so we're gonna do this here"},{"startMs":2134800,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"in a few minutes but I think you're"},{"startMs":2136300,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"gonna do pretty good here so let's think"},{"startMs":2137380,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"about rotating right again"},{"startMs":2147160,"durationMs":4939,"subtitle":"okay there we go good strong rotate"},{"startMs":2149079,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"right nothing about lift"},{"startMs":2153520,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"that's rotate right"},{"startMs":2156280,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"so I found especially like with"},{"startMs":2158079,"durationMs":3181,"subtitle":"opposites like left and right that we"},{"startMs":2159880,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"think about left and then we think right"},{"startMs":2161260,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"oh right's the opposite of left now we"},{"startMs":2162940,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"thought about left again so it's"},{"startMs":2164440,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"important that we think about is"},{"startMs":2165520,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"completely separate sure okay all right"},{"startMs":2168160,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"so you want to train we'll train for"},{"startMs":2169359,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"Lift again okay just start with a new"},{"startMs":2171400,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"thought for Lift sure okay with you"},{"startMs":2173020,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"thought for a lift"},{"startMs":2174820,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"all right so lift up up and away"},{"startMs":2184240,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"there we go that's a good lift can I"},{"startMs":2186520,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"think about rotating right"},{"startMs":2191859,"durationMs":5341,"subtitle":"that's left oh there you go rotate right"},{"startMs":2193300,"durationMs":6319,"subtitle":"okay let's try it you ready to try go uh"},{"startMs":2197200,"durationMs":2419,"subtitle":"okay"},{"startMs":2201339,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"so go ahead and lift it up a little
