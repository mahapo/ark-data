which"},{"startMs":85119,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"might make withdrawal more tolerable for"},{"startMs":87600,"durationMs":6199,"subtitle":"people so in addition to his

how"},{"startMs":115000,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"it was you came to be interested in"},{"startMs":116680,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"issues around withdrawal from"},{"startMs":118439,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"psychiatric drugs"},{"startMs":120399,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"yeah of course so so interesting"},{"startMs":122600,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"question actually that I get asked a lot"},{"startMs":124719,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"long story short I I like good science"},{"startMs":127159,"durationMs":4521,"subtitle":"and I'm I like studying what good"},{"startMs":129679,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"science is which is a research field in"},{"startMs":131680,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"its own right right research methodology"},{"startMs":134239,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"like the science of science if you may"},{"startMs":137400,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"um when you're really interested in"},{"startMs":139239,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"quality science and then dive into"},{"startMs":140720,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"psychiatric research uh your heart is"},{"startMs":143879,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"kind of broken it it looks convincing"},{"startMs":146120,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and it looks persuasive and it's written"},{"startMs":147840,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"in a very academic and persuasive"},{"startMs":149480,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"language which with all the brain scans"},{"startMs":151120,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"and the biological measures fancy words"},{"startMs":153879,"durationMs":4041,"subtitle":"all the theories but is in reality"},{"startMs":155519,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"replete with assumptions and bias"},{"startMs":157920,"durationMs":3679,"subtitle":"especially regarding the theories we"},{"startMs":159480,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"have about how psychiatric drugs work"},{"startMs":161599,"durationMs":3321,"subtitle":"and that's what got me into this field"},{"startMs":163200,"durationMs":4119,"subtitle":"actually so when you study the"},{"startMs":164920,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"literature in this light what happens at"},{"startMs":167319,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"least for me and I know another a couple"},{"startMs":168920,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"of other colleagues who did this you end"},{"startMs":170680,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"up understanding psychiatric drugs as as"},{"startMs":173120,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"P symptomatic treatment which can be"},{"startMs":175400,"durationMs":4479,"subtitle":"helpful for some people in some"},{"startMs":177400,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"situations prefer be in acute crisis"},{"startMs":179879,"durationMs":4121,"subtitle":"short term but but in a fundamentally"},{"startMs":182319,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"different way than what we're told about"},{"startMs":184000,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"various biological abnormalities and so"},{"startMs":186159,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"on so um again long story short I I did"},{"startMs":189760,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"my bachelors back in 2014 now it's eight"},{"startMs":192519,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"years ago on something called"},{"startMs":194120,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"epigenetics which I shouldn't dive too"},{"startMs":196200,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"much into but the idea was en titled the"},{"startMs":198840,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"implications of epigenetics on"},{"startMs":200680,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"psychiatric drug treatment kind of"},{"startMs":202400,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"debunking these basic assumptions of"},{"startMs":204280,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"arguing uh of talking about"},{"startMs":207080,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"anti-depressants antis psychotics and"},{"startMs":209159,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"they're being any causal relationship"},{"startMs":211000,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"between any brain abnormality and the"},{"startMs":213239,"durationMs":5761,"subtitle":"reason for intervening there it just"},{"startMs":215680,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"doesn't hold up um uh it's not true and"},{"startMs":219000,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"I believe we can make that argument"},{"startMs":220640,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"using pure data and logic well the point"},{"startMs":223519,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"is my next question was then okay how"},{"startMs":225840,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"then do psychiatric drugs work and I'm"},{"startMs":227599,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"still interested in this question it's"},{"startMs":229480,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"not that they don't work it's that they"},{"startMs":231040,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"work in a different way that we're told"},{"startMs":233360,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"and that regard because I am a"},{"startMs":234560,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"psychologist there is a a concept in"},{"startMs":236920,"durationMs":6319,"subtitle":"Psychology called emotion regulation uh"},{"startMs":240040,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"and just consider the definition of this"},{"startMs":243239,"durationMs":4161,"subtitle":"emotion regulation and psychology is"},{"startMs":244959,"durationMs":5241,"subtitle":"defined as its strategies like the"},{"startMs":247400,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"processes by which individuals influence"},{"startMs":250200,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"which emotions they have when they have"},{"startMs":252319,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"them and how they experience and express"},{"startMs":254439,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"these emotions another definition is"},{"startMs":257000,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"actions taken by a person to modify or"},{"startMs":259120,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"change emotions or increase or reduce"},{"startMs":260959,"durationMs":5001,"subtitle":"their intensity"},{"startMs":263080,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"now if we if we for once leave the idea"},{"startMs":265960,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"of them treating any biological"},{"startMs":267560,"durationMs":3639,"subtitle":"illnesses these Concepts kind of make"},{"startMs":269680,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"sense for me is what psychiatric drugs"},{"startMs":271199,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"do they are emotion regulation"},{"startMs":272960,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"strategies they're things we do or take"},{"startMs":275440,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"to regulate our minds our moods there's"},{"startMs":278240,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"psychoactive substances no biological"},{"startMs":280240,"durationMs":5679,"subtitle":"matching happening there so and the"},{"startMs":282600,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"reason this is is interesting is that um"},{"startMs":285919,"durationMs":3641,"subtitle":"emotion regulation has received a lot of"},{"startMs":287720,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"attention in Clinical Psychology because"},{"startMs":289560,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"it appears that it matters how we"},{"startMs":291639,"durationMs":4521,"subtitle":"regulate our emotions and thoughts so"},{"startMs":294280,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"strategies like we know that strategies"},{"startMs":296160,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"like avoidance suppression uh substance"},{"startMs":298400,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"use distraction worrying rumination"},{"startMs":301720,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"isolating ourselves all these strategies"},{"startMs":303800,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"tend to correlate with Psychopathology"},{"startMs":305600,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and actually can predict it because they"},{"startMs":307960,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"were often work here and now but then"},{"startMs":309320,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"tend to backfire long term creating"},{"startMs":311080,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"other problems whereas strategies like"},{"startMs":313360,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"acceptance problem solving allowing"},{"startMs":315400,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"emotions to unfold actually listening to"},{"startMs":317560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"them cognitive restructuring detached"},{"startMs":320160,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"mindfulness all these fancy"},{"startMs":321560,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"psychological terms tend to correlate"},{"startMs":323280,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"with less Psychopathology or no levels"},{"startMs":325360,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"of Psychopathology so I ask myself the"},{"startMs":327880,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"question what is the difference between"},{"startMs":329960,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"helping people come off psychiatric"},{"startMs":331520,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"drugs which is a way of numbing the Mind"},{"startMs":333960,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"avoiding emotions introducing artificial"},{"startMs":336600,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"control and doing what I would otherwise"},{"startMs":338479,"durationMs":5921,"subtitle":"do as a psychologist and I concluded in"},{"startMs":341240,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"my my my Master's thesis back back in"},{"startMs":344400,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"2016 that these are largely the same I"},{"startMs":347520,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"can draw on much of my psychotherapeutic"},{"startMs":350240,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"tools if you may helping people come off"},{"startMs":352400,"durationMs":4359,"subtitle":"psychiatric drugs with one major"},{"startMs":354759,"durationMs":4761,"subtitle":"difference which is why we're here today"},{"startMs":356759,"durationMs":6081,"subtitle":"the withdrawal symptoms you can't just"},{"startMs":359520,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"stuff you can't just remove drugs as a"},{"startMs":362840,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"strategy because you get dependent on"},{"startMs":364960,"durationMs":3639,"subtitle":"them and I discovered early with my"},{"startMs":366960,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"first patients that they couldn't just"},{"startMs":368599,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"stop and the withdrawal reactions they"},{"startMs":371000,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"experienced were way worse way more"},{"startMs":373080,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"extreme and long lasting than what we"},{"startMs":375319,"durationMs":4841,"subtitle":"were tolded and that was really what"},{"startMs":377479,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"started my interest in this field I kind"},{"startMs":380160,"durationMs":3439,"subtitle":"of decided to trust my patients and not"},{"startMs":381960,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"so much of the books because I've seen"},{"startMs":383599,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"other things in their Psychiatry books"},{"startMs":385280,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"that turn out to not be true so that"},{"startMs":387199,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"kind of set the stage for this whole p"},{"startMs":389440,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"PhD and where I am now great thank you"},{"startMs":392039,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"Anders that's that that's really helpful"},{"startMs":393720,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and I'm so heartened to hear that there"},{"startMs":395240,"durationMs":4359,"subtitle":"are people that want to look beyond the"},{"startMs":397000,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"standard texts and the standard"},{"startMs":399599,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"teachings to try and work out for"},{"startMs":401639,"durationMs":3241,"subtitle":"themselves what's going on so you know"},{"startMs":403479,"durationMs":5081,"subtitle":"I'm really grateful that this work is"},{"startMs":404880,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"going on so um moving on then to your"},{"startMs":408560,"durationMs":6079,"subtitle":"research into withdrawal in in in 2021"},{"startMs":411960,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"you authored a paper which reviewed a"},{"startMs":414639,"durationMs":4361,"subtitle":"very important aspect of how"},{"startMs":415879,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"anti-depressants affect the body um so"},{"startMs":419000,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"without getting too Technical and you"},{"startMs":420520,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"know people might be able to go and find"},{"startMs":421720,"durationMs":4879,"subtitle":"the paper themselves we we sometimes"},{"startMs":423960,"durationMs":5519,"subtitle":"hear about brain Imaging techniques pet"},{"startMs":426599,"durationMs":5121,"subtitle":"or spec scans being used to study what"},{"startMs":429479,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"is known as serotonin transport or"},{"startMs":431720,"durationMs":4159,"subtitle":"occupancy so before we talk about the"},{"startMs":434160,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"findings of your research could you tell"},{"startMs":435879,"durationMs":3561,"subtitle":"us a little bit about what serotonin"},{"startMs":437520,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"transporter occupancy is and why it"},{"startMs":439440,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"might be important in understanding"},{"startMs":440840,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"withdrawal"},{"startMs":442080,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"problems yes of course because it is"},{"startMs":444520,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"kind of the center of the main main"},{"startMs":446280,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"argument here and uh I'll try it's a"},{"startMs":448240,"durationMs":6399,"subtitle":"very geeky paper even for me to read"},{"startMs":450520,"durationMs":5959,"subtitle":"even G are right but but um but the so"},{"startMs":454639,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"the serotonin transporter is is a"},{"startMs":456479,"durationMs":3921,"subtitle":"receptor it's the primary

psychiatric"},{"startMs":462440,"durationMs":4759,"subtitle":"drugs do they occupy receptors it's even"},{"startMs":464639,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"in the name SSRI so it stands for"},{"startMs":467199,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"Selective serotonin reuptake"},{"startMs":469879,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"inhibitor so the brain has a function

called"},{"startMs":477120,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"the serotonin transporter so already to"},{"startMs":479520,"durationMs":6239,"subtitle":"know is that that that occupancy then is"},{"startMs":482039,"durationMs":7041,"subtitle":"a term for what the drug do they occupy"},{"startMs":485759,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"receptors so serotonin

it's"},{"startMs":496599,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"reductionistic to only look at one"},{"startMs":498280,"durationMs":5639,"subtitle":"receptor so the first s and SSR actually"},{"startMs":501560,"durationMs":3639,"subtitle":"it's not possible ask anyone who studies"},{"startMs":503919,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"in the brain they'll say it's not"},{"startMs":505199,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"possible to just selectively Target one"},{"startMs":507479,"durationMs":4961,"subtitle":"receptor and then increase or decrease"},{"startMs":509440,"durationMs":4599,"subtitle":"is that um but it's the primary"},{"startMs":512440,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"biological effect that's why we

the"},{"startMs":519240,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"drug occupies this receptor once we"},{"startMs":521959,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"understand that brain chemistry is
