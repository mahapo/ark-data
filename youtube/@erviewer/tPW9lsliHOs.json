this"},{"startMs":405090,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"way which is why I"},{"startMs":406650,"durationMs":6090,"subtitle":"resonate so powerfully with that type

was"},{"startMs":579829,"durationMs":5401,"subtitle":"intentionally designed to make learning"},{"startMs":582110,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"as difficult as possible yeah and you"},{"startMs":585230,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"you would dread walking into these"},{"startMs":587390,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"spaces not because you didn't

wow"},{"startMs":615260,"durationMs":6190,"subtitle":"it's so much easier to to think clearly"},{"startMs":620270,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"to"},{"startMs":621450,"durationMs":7250,"subtitle":"you learn to open yourself up to new"},{"startMs":623790,"durationMs":8670,"subtitle":"ideas to to be in the headspace to be"},{"startMs":628700,"durationMs":5890,"subtitle":"receptive to learning on all

we"},{"startMs":664440,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"start designing buildings it makes sense"},{"startMs":667620,"durationMs":6990,"subtitle":"to me why people can't think clearly"},{"startMs":671060,"durationMs":7350,"subtitle":"this is also the case with once I got"},{"startMs":674610,"durationMs":6390,"subtitle":"into the corporate world I realized that"},{"startMs":678410,"durationMs":5770,"subtitle":"the building had a lot to do with my"},{"startMs":681000,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"performance and my productivity because"},{"startMs":684180,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"I've worked in some places that were"},{"startMs":686460,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"hell on earth not because the job

to"},{"startMs":733950,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"productivity and clear thinking and then"},{"startMs":738180,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"immediately after that went back to

you"},{"startMs":1817150,"durationMs":7290,"subtitle":"know I'll give you an example of why I'm"},{"startMs":1819670,"durationMs":7470,"subtitle":"encouraged though so when I say"},{"startMs":1824440,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"something like sacred geometry a lot of"},{"startMs":1827140,"durationMs":6390,"subtitle":"people scoff because they don't"},{"startMs":1828940,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"understand what that is and it I that's"},{"startMs":1833530,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"really the best way to describe it

and"},{"startMs":1839980,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"buildings from these periods of time and"},{"startMs":1842770,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"you realize that the architects and the"},{"startMs":1846460,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"designers of that type of art were using"},{"startMs":1849550,"durationMs":5250,"subtitle":"formulas that were very well established"},{"startMs":1851320,"durationMs":6390,"subtitle":"all right and now we call it sacred"},{"startMs":1854800,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"geometry but at some point in time all"},{"startMs":1857710,"durationMs":6150,"subtitle":"of that stuff all of those guilds of"},{"startMs":1860760,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"craftsmen that knew that it just went"},{"startMs":1863860,"durationMs":5190,"subtitle":"underground yeah it didn't really die it"},{"startMs":1867100,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"just sort of it went underground because"},{"startMs":1869050,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"it went out of fashion yeah and we you"},{"startMs":1872170,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"know we've come through all these sort"},{"startMs":1873820,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"of you know communist ideas of design"},{"startMs":1878050,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"and aesthetic which is awful and but in"},{"startMs":1882160,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"the background underneath all of that"},{"startMs":1884310,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"there are have been people that have"},{"startMs":1886600,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"been keeping all of that knowledge that"},{"startMs":1889330,"durationMs":7950,"subtitle":"the old architects and artists used to"},{"startMs":1891940,"durationMs":8460,"subtitle":"use and it's interesting because I was"},{"startMs":1897280,"durationMs":9620,"subtitle":"asked to be part of a panel discussion"},{"startMs":1900400,"durationMs":11030,"subtitle":"at UT Dallas the University as part of a"},{"startMs":1906900,"durationMs":8200,"subtitle":"an effort where they want to reintroduce"},{"startMs":1911430,"durationMs":7420,"subtitle":"sacred geometry back into the curriculum"},{"startMs":1915100,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"at the university level and as soon as"},{"startMs":1918850,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"that happened and I went and I was part"},{"startMs":1920800,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"of these discussions at the University"},{"startMs":1924160,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"and it dawned on me like this is"},{"startMs":1927460,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"starting to be taken seriously again"},{"startMs":1929650,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"right they're not there yet because most"},{"startMs":1935020,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"of the people in the room didn't get it"},{"startMs":1936970,"durationMs":3390,"subtitle":"I just did not get it but the city they"},{"startMs":1939580,"durationMs":1979,"subtitle":"didn't get"},{"startMs":1940360,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"we were talking of what we were just"},{"startMs":1941559,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"talking about they know you can actually"},{"startMs":1943120,"durationMs":5029,"subtitle":"design buildings to enhance productivity"},{"startMs":1946240,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"CLEP you know like all of this stuff"},{"startMs":1948149,"durationMs":4241,"subtitle":"healing you can design a building that's"},{"startMs":1950860,"durationMs":2909,"subtitle":"just healing you from being in the"},{"startMs":1952390,"durationMs":3539,"subtitle":"building yeah"},{"startMs":1953769,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"design the hospitals that way why not"},{"startMs":1955929,"durationMs":9571,"subtitle":"like why design a hospital like a prison"},{"startMs":1958090,"durationMs":12000,"subtitle":"yeah and so it it is encouraging to me"},{"startMs":1965500,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"that at the university level this is"},{"startMs":1970090,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"starting to come back in right which"},{"startMs":1973600,"durationMs":4590,"subtitle":"tells me that okay if there are"},{"startMs":1975070,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"discussions like this happening now but"},{"startMs":1978190,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"they're not ready to move forward on it"},{"startMs":1979630,"durationMs":3929,"subtitle":"because how do you come up with a"},{"startMs":1981549,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"curriculum yeah that was that was sort"},{"startMs":1983559,"durationMs":4521,"subtitle":"of the gist of the panel is how do we"},{"startMs":1985630,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"come up with a curriculum yeah on"},{"startMs":1988080,"durationMs":6969,"subtitle":"teaching these old principles to"},{"startMs":1991690,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"students that can't see it you know and"},{"startMs":1995049,"durationMs":5161,"subtitle":"I have short attention spans oh yeah"},{"startMs":1997510,"durationMs":5490,"subtitle":"because a lot of this stuff these are"},{"startMs":2000210,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"these are meditations you you a lot of"},{"startMs":2003000,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"this geometry you just have to sit and"},{"startMs":2004830,"durationMs":8309,"subtitle":"think about four months before before"},{"startMs":2010620,"durationMs":5070,"subtitle":"you can put them into a design so even"},{"startMs":2013139,"durationMs":4741,"subtitle":"the casual designer couldn't take a"},{"startMs":2015690,"durationMs":4349,"subtitle":"class and then just design something to"},{"startMs":2017880,"durationMs":4259,"subtitle":"achieve an effect you would have you'd"},{"startMs":2020039,"durationMs":6301,"subtitle":"have to have a whole degree program yeah"},{"startMs":2022139,"durationMs":6691,"subtitle":"around teaching these concepts and we're"},{"startMs":2026340,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"getting there they're talking about and"},{"startMs":2028830,"durationMs":4219,"subtitle":"then the other example is I was telling"},{"startMs":2030720,"durationMs":4890,"subtitle":"you earlier about bio geometry in this"},{"startMs":2033049,"durationMs":5561,"subtitle":"Egyptian architect who's quite famous"},{"startMs":2035610,"durationMs":5819,"subtitle":"that came up with this system of bio"},{"startMs":2038610,"durationMs":5669,"subtitle":"geometry which is exactly this thing"},{"startMs":2041429,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"designing buildings and spaces and"},{"startMs":2044279,"durationMs":7501,"subtitle":"airplanes and cars and everything you"},{"startMs":2047159,"durationMs":7230,"subtitle":"embed this geometry into the structures"},{"startMs":2051780,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"and you're getting effects you're"},{"startMs":2054389,"durationMs":5671,"subtitle":"getting healing effects you're getting"},{"startMs":2057260,"durationMs":6339,"subtitle":"blocking electromagnetic pollution"},{"startMs":2060060,"durationMs":7470,"subtitle":"effects all of this is possible just"},{"startMs":2063599,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"through designing this architect they"},{"startMs":2067530,"durationMs":2899,"subtitle":"have university classes where they're"},{"startMs":2069240,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"teaching by a genome"},{"startMs":2070429,"durationMs":7670,"subtitle":"tree in Europe I was gonna say where"},{"startMs":2073700,"durationMs":7199,"subtitle":"they end in Europe and so that between"},{"startMs":2078099,"durationMs":5381,"subtitle":"that is happening it's like it is"},{"startMs":2080899,"durationMs":6811,"subtitle":"happening which tells me that okay give"},{"startMs":2083480,"durationMs":7230,"subtitle":"it another 20 years and this will no"},{"startMs":2087710,"durationMs":4889,"subtitle":"longer be pseudoscience it will just be"},{"startMs":2090710,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"part of the design process it'll be part"},{"startMs":2092599,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"of an architectural degree it'll be back"},{"startMs":2094460,"durationMs":6599,"subtitle":"into balance again and as soon as that"},{"startMs":2097400,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"happens then we're starting to to see"},{"startMs":2101059,"durationMs":2611,"subtitle":"that okay"},{"startMs":2101660,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"now we're actually in that period of a"},{"startMs":2103670,"durationMs":6630,"subtitle":"new renaissance because of an entirely"},{"startMs":2106430,"durationMs":7110,"subtitle":"new generation or a few generations are"},{"startMs":2110300,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"raised of designers and architects and"},{"startMs":2113540,"durationMs":4769,"subtitle":"artists are raised knowing those"},{"startMs":2115400,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"principles then all of a sudden as soon"},{"startMs":2118309,"durationMs":3151,"subtitle":"as they become of age I'll be building"},{"startMs":2120170,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"they'll building it you're building a"},{"startMs":2121460,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"building it so you know I don't know if"},{"startMs":2124460,"durationMs":5210,"subtitle":"we'll see it in our lifetime but I think"},{"startMs":2126980,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"it's just right there it's really close"},{"startMs":2129670,"durationMs":6210,"subtitle":"well you did you're definitely a part of"},{"startMs":2132109,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"it in my in my perspective my view of
