After this he must be free for a while. As it is written: ‚ÄúWhen the thousand years are finished, Satan will be free to leave his prison. He will go out and fool the nations who are over all the world.‚Äù\n\nWe can find a parallel in Norse mythology, with the trickster God Loki, eventually punished and bound by the gods. A serpent hangs above Loki, and drips venom onto him, which makes him writhe in agony, making the whole world shake and bringing about the earthquakes that preceded Ragnar√∂k, the end of the world and the destruction of the gods. But why must the figure of the Devil be freed? Jung writes: ‚ÄúThe coming of the Antichrist is not just a prophetic prediction ‚Äì it is an invariable psychological law whose existence‚Ä¶ brought him [John, author of the Book of Revelation] a sure knowledge of the impending enantiodromia.‚Äù\n\nIf there is any one-sidedness to a pair, a conversion, or shift over to the other is likely. This is the fundamental psychological law of enantiodromia (a running towards the opposite), which Jung discovered from Heraclitus.\n\n#devil #antichrist #revelation","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2RLWMgr-IA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2RLWMgr-IA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2RLWMgr-IA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2RLWMgr-IA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2RLWMgr-IA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Eternalised","playlistId":"UUqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"a2RLWMgr-IA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Eternalised","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"IDvty19y4zCHyCEv8AbMDjcpb2Y","id":"VVVxb3MxdGwwUm50dWNHR3RQWE54a2tBLlJiT045ZjBiQ0tv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-10T16:01:09Z","channelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","title":"Satanism is Evil Disguised as Good","description":"Satanism is evil disguised as good. The demonic is hidden in secret. God tells us to be careful of going down the path of destruction, and stands in front of us blocking the way. It seems that he is not on our side, because we are not free, and cannot do what we want to do. The Devil, on the other hand, appears to be on our side, and whispers to our ear: ‚Äújust do what makes you happy, life is too short‚Äù, ‚Äútimes have changed, we live in a new world with new rules‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone else is doing it, why shouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äù, ‚Äúyou obey no one, and you are the God of yourself.‚Äù This is how the Devil talks, and when we experience ego-inflation, he smiles because it is only a matter of time till we join his kingdom of darkness.\n\n#satan #psychology #evil","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RbON9f0bCKo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RbON9f0bCKo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RbON9f0bCKo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RbON9f0bCKo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RbON9f0bCKo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Eternalised","playlistId":"UUqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RbON9f0bCKo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Eternalised","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"oh0Ozr3SBZr1d1uIH2TLox_qtl0","id":"VVVxb3MxdGwwUm50dWNHR3RQWE54a2tBLmg5Y2ZhazVUSHVN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-06T15:25:02Z","channelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","title":"How to Find Your Truth (The Eternal)","description":"To find one‚Äôs truth is certainly no easy task, because where there is a path, it is probably someone else‚Äôs path. We must walk alone where the forest is darkest, and where there is no path. When we experience the dark night of the soul, our truth may shatter and we realise how futile it is to us. The truth that truly matters to us, however, does not shatter in our moment of despair, it sustains us and keeps us afloat, even though we may still rebel against it. \n\nAfter finding one‚Äôs subjective truth and expressing it in the world, the Sage must align it with the truth beyond himself. Truth must necessarily go beyond our subjectivity, for it is the objective truth that grounds us in the eternal, and this is only possible if one has a relationship with God, a higher self that overwhelms one‚Äôs self, so that, paradoxically, one truly becomes oneself. In other words, one‚Äôs individual will is aligned with objective truth.\n\n#truth #god #eternal","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9cfak5THuM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9cfak5THuM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9cfak5THuM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9cfak5THuM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9cfak5THuM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Eternalised","playlistId":"UUqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","position":2,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"h9cfak5THuM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Eternalised","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"cni6Ld4P2FAwwLCSbnCq-CXH5rs","id":"VVVxb3MxdGwwUm50dWNHR3RQWE54a2tBLng0OWwxcHZZZk1j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-03T16:51:01Z","channelId":"UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA","title":"Loneliness and The Forgotten Art of Solitude","description":"In a time when loneliness is rampant, when a person can be surrounded by a group of people and feel even more alienated than being alone, the Wise Old Man comes to teach us the forgotten art of solitude, the voluntary withdrawal from society and the ability to make a smooth transition back into the world again when it is time to return. Those who have neglected their inner self to the extent that they exist solely in relation to others, have failed to listen to this inner voice. Their self-identity relies exclusively on others, so they lose themselves in the crowd.

In myth he is often shown as one living in isolation, meditating and living a simple life deep in a forest, in the mountains, or in other uninhabited places. The Wise Old Man is a lover of wisdom, and uses his experience to guide others. He is portrayed as a mysterious person or a wizard, in contact with nature and the numinous and unseen forces that permeate our existence. \n\nThe Wise Old man appears as a teacher of wisdom such as King Solomon from the Bible. In Hermeticism, he is Hermes Trismegistus, the fount of all wisdom and the teacher of the mystery of all ages. In China, the sage is Lao Tzu (\"old man\" or \"old master\"), the founder of Taoism, while in India there are the sadhus and yogis. In Arthurian Legend he is Merlin, in Nietzsche he appears as the prophet Zarathustra, and in Carl Jung as Philemon. In modern popular fiction we have Yoda, Gandalf and Dumbledore, among others.\n\nIn the individuation process (the lifelong journey towards psychic wholeness), the archetype of the Wise Old Man is late to emerge, and is therefore seen as an indication of the Self (the total personality).\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: \n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Jung and Tarot: An Archetypal Journey - Sallie Nichols\nhttps://amzn.to/3PH7zM2\n‚ñ∂ Awakening the Heroes Within - Carol S.

It epitomises the true spirit of Western man and is, in many ways, the myth of Western civilisation. It is a perennial and timeless pattern that expresses fundamental concerns of the human condition. \n\nThe Holy Grail is a mysterious object guarded by a king in a hidden castle. It has been described as a cup, dish, or a magical stone that can provide healing powers, immortality, eternal youth, and unlimited nourishment. It represents the fulfilment of the highest spiritual potentialities in human consciousness, which endows the world with a symbolic and spiritual meaning. The quest for the Holy Grail is always more or less the same, it is the hero‚Äôs journey, at the end of which one obtains the ‚Äútreasure hard to attain.‚Äù It is the search for that which makes life most meaningful. \n\nPsychologically, the Holy Grail‚Äîlike the philosophers' stone‚Äîis a symbol of the Self, the psychic totality and ultimate wholeness of the human being. The soul which represents the life principle, is that wondrous vessel which is the goal of the quest, whose final secret can never be revealed, but must ever remain hidden because its essence is a mystery.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/08/23/the-quest-for-the-holy-grail-the-self\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ The Grail Legend - Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz\nhttps://amzn.to/3KL9Oei\n‚ñ∂ Perceval, or the Story of the Grail - Chr√©tien de Troyes\nhttps://amzn.to/3YFvm1V\n‚ñ∂ Parzival - Wolfram von Eschenbach\nhttps://amzn.to/3KJgOIK\n‚ñ∂ Merlin and the Grail.

We are fundamentally story-telling creatures, and there is much we can learn by reflecting on the fairy tales heard in childhood. They seem almost magical because they connect us with emotions deeply buried within that cannot find expression in outer life, because as we grow up, the world of imagination is shunned by our peers, considered as unproductive and good for nothing.\n\nFairy tales can provide us with a sense that we are not alone in our life struggles. Humans have faced these struggles in one form or another since the beginning of time, and fairy tales represent this fundamental concern of the human condition. \n\nPsychologically, fairy tales reflect our inner landscape, and the characters can represent aspects of our own personalities. Jungian analyst Marie-Louise von Franz writes: \"Fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes. Therefore, their value for the scientific investigation of the unconscious exceeds that of all other material. They represent archetypes in their simplest, barest, and most concise form.\"\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/07/23/the-psychology-of-fairy-tales\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales\nhttps://amzn.to/3pveOwy\n‚ñ∂ The Interpretation of Fairy Tales\nhttps://amzn.to/44cz05n\n‚ñ∂ Shadow and Evil in Fairy Tales\nhttps://amzn.to/44wRoFP\n‚ñ∂ Individuation in Fairy Tales\nhttps://amzn.to/43cABXE\n‚ñ∂ C.W.

He is the adversary, the accuser, the tempter, the deceiver, and the one who divides from God. The Devil is incredibly wicked and evil, but also intelligent and witty ‚Äì he is the father of all tricksters ‚Äì that is what makes him so dangerous. The English word ‚Äúdevil‚Äù derives from the Greek di√°bolos (‚Äúthe one who divides‚Äù). Diabolic is the term in contemporary English. The Greek verb dia-bollein literally means to tear apart.  These divisions occur in almost every facet of our lives: race, sex, religion, politics, and economics. The demonic is an inversion of order.\n\nTemptation is the ordinary activity of the devil. It is a real thing for us in each and every day. It begins with deception, buying into the lies of the devil, who promises good, only to deliver evil. The goal of this is to create division or inner conflict in ourselves. In despair, we numb ourselves with pleasure or diversion, which can lead to addiction. Hell is that state of mind which has abandoned itself so completely to a given sin that it cannot act independently of that sin.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/06/24/the-psychology-of-the-devil/\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Holy Bible\nhttps://amzn.to/3p3xDGV\n‚ñ∂ Answer to Job - Jung\nhttps://amzn.to/3Nfv38P\n‚ñ∂ Love and Will ‚Äì Rollo May\nhttps://amzn.to/3Nen3F4\n‚ñ∂ Faust - Goethe\nhttps://amzn.to/44pDdm3\n‚ñ∂ Tarot and the Archetypal Journey: The Jungian Path from Darkness to Light - Sallie Nichols\nhttps://amzn.to/3qSHXSz\n‚ñ∂ The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso - Dante Alighieri\nhttps://amzn.to/42XEXBu\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

There have been fools who have caused surprise and laughter since time immemorial. We worship folly by seeing it in people and in the world and by willingly displaying it in ourselves. It is one of the timeless archetypes, which we all inherit at birth.\n\nMany of us suffer from the absence of the fool in our lives. Frenetic and upright, we take ourselves too seriously. As William Shakespeare said, ‚ÄúAll the world‚Äôs a stage, and all the men and women merely players.‚Äù Forgetting that playfulness is a basic human need, we wonder why we so easily become bored and exhausted, losing all capacity for spontaneity, authenticity, and passion. The antidote to this would be to give the fool archetype some space in our lives.\n\n‚ÄúThe soul demands your folly; not your wisdom.‚Äù - Carl Jung\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/05/25/the-psychology-of-the-fool/\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ In Praise of Folly\nhttps://amzn.to/436tosq\n‚ñ∂ King Lear \nhttps://amzn.to/3IwNkNg\n‚ñ∂ He: Understanding Masculine Psychology \nhttps://amzn.to/3BLnt0g\n‚ñ∂ Don Quixote \nhttps://amzn.to/3MKYbp7\n‚ñ∂ The Idiot \nhttps://amzn.to/43d5I5J\n‚ñ∂ Ivan the Fool and Three Shorter Tales for Living Peaceably\nhttps://amzn.to/3OpeoBO\n‚ñ∂ Tarot and the Archetypal Journey: The Jungian Path from Darkness to Light \nhttps://amzn.to/45jCKms\n‚ñ∂ The Complete Grimms' Fairy Tales \nhttps://amzn.to/3MCUHE8\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

We all have them. But what exactly do they mean? Why do we have bad dreams? Is there any psychological meaning behind them? Nightmares are the source of much of the horror we see in stories, myths, movies and games. They are an encounter with the dark side of the unconscious, which often includes facing some of the most painful aspects of who we are. And one does not know what that part of oneself is, until one confronts it.\n\nNightmares are the most substantial and vitally important dreams, and are of therapeutic value. They wake us up with a cry, as if all our repressed content forms a bubble which expands until it bursts one night, and we experience a nightmare. They are the shock therapy nature uses on us when we are too unaware of some psychological danger, and shock us out of deep unconscious sleepiness about some dangerous situation. As if the unconscious says, ‚ÄúLook here, this problem is urgent!‚Äù The psyche tells us to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and face what we have neglected. The majority of nightmares represent opportunities for personal healing through much-needed emotional release.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/04/27/the-psychology-of-nightmares\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüé∂ Music used\n\nAftermath ‚Äì Kevin MacLeod\nDreams Become Real ‚Äì Kevin MacLeod\nHeartbreaking ‚Äì Kevin MacLeod\nSinister Dark Ambient Background Music ‚Äì Dark Rage ‚Äì CO.AG Music\nCrystal Dream Mix ‚Äì CO.AG Music\nThe Long Dark ‚Äì Scott Buckley\nPeaceful Ambient Background Music ‚Äì Heroes ‚Äì CO.AG.

It forms the prototype from which many other forms of healing are derived, such as modern psychotherapy. The shamanic journey is an expression of the human condition, and despite the cultural differences around the world, the deeper structure appears to remain constant. A common thread seems to connect all shamans across the planet. An awakening to other orders of reality, the experience of ecstasy, and an opening up of visionary realms form the essence of the shamanic mission.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/03/30/the-psychology-of-the-shaman\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Shaman: The Wounded Healer\nhttps://amzn.to/3z8YMK0\n‚ñ∂ Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy\nhttps://amzn.to/42FR47z\n‚ñ∂ Jung and Shamanism in Dialogue: Retrieving the Soul\nhttps://amzn.to/3nojT8t\n‚ñ∂ Psychotherapy \nhttps://amzn.to/3ZjWUIX\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Modern philosophy has forgotten this tradition, and philosophical discourse has all but overtaken philosophy as a way of life. Philosophy is not just an intellectual discipline, which can get abstract and divorced from the real world, but is most importantly a way of life that teaches us how to best live our lives. \n\nPhilosophy is a mode of existing in the world, which has to be practiced at each instant, and the goal of which is to transform the whole of the individual‚Äôs life. Real wisdom does not merely cause us to know: it makes us ‚Äúbe‚Äù in a different way. \n\nAncient philosophy proposed to mankind an art of living. By contrast modern philosophy appears above all as the construction of a technical jargon reserved for specialists.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2023/01/14/philosophy-a-guide-to-life\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Philosophy as a Way of Life - Hadot\nhttps://amzn.to/3iC1aUR\n‚ñ∂ What is Ancient Philosophy? - Hadot\nhttps://amzn.to/3CN3DTf\n‚ñ∂ The Republic - Plato\nhttps://amzn.to/3ixkqmw\n‚ñ∂ Outlines of Pyrrhonism - Sextus Empiricus\nhttps://amzn.to/3k7zHdU\n‚ñ∂ Meditations - Marcus Aurelius\nhttps://amzn.to/3kgcmXA\n‚ñ∂ Letters from a Stoic - Seneca\nhttps://amzn.to/3kg2MnM\n‚ñ∂ Enchiridion - Epictetus\nhttps://amzn.to/3H737lm\n‚ñ∂ A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - William B.

It is the archetype at the bottom of all genuine healing procedures. As long as we feel victimised, bitter and resentful towards our wound, and seek to escape from suffering it, we remain inescapably bound to it. This is neurotic suffering, as opposed to the authentic suffering of the wounded healer which is purified. The wound can destroy you, or it can wake you up.  As Carl Jung wrote, \"The doctor is effective only when he himself is affected.

It is no imaginary place, but rather a state of consciousness that we all experience at some point in our lives. Hell is an unavoidable journey in life. In ancient mysteries or rituals of passages, the hero must descend into a dark place in order to give birth to a new consciousness and gain access to a new stage of life. It is the most profound psychological death and rebirth of the self. \n\nWe will be exploring the journey into hell as the path to self-knowledge, self-transformation, and ultimately, self-transcendence. Only in the region of danger can one find the treasure hard to attain.

This is one of the few blessings of living in an age of anxiety. To venture causes anxiety, but not to venture is to lose oneself. To venture in the highest sense is precisely to become conscious of oneself.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/11/07/loneliness-emptiness-anxiety\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ Man's Search for Himself ‚Äì Rollo May\nhttps://amzn.to/3DErmo4\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Carl Jung used the term in the exploration of the psychology of eternal youth and creative child within every person. \n\nIt is an archetype, and like all archetypes, has both a positive and a negative side. It can bring the energy, beauty and creativity of childhood into adult life, or thwart self-realisation and doom us to both unrealistic adolescent fantasies and experiencing life as a prison. \n\nThe puer is the man-child who refuses to grow up, take responsibility, and face life‚Äôs challenges, he expects other people, typically his parents, to solve all his problems. He tries to go as high as possible away from reality, ending up like Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn‚Äôt grow up, who lives in Neverland, a place where people cease to age and are eternally young. The puer aeternus is also known as the Peter Pan syndrome. This has become an increasingly common problem in our modern age.\n\nThose who find themselves unable to commit to work, to form satisfactory relationships, to commit to the discipline of education, to carry the weight of responsibility, or who feel that their life has become meaningless, will find the integration of the archetype of eternal youth invaluable in their life.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/10/09/puer-aeternus-psychology\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry\nhttps://amzn.to/3EuWMiW\n‚ñ∂ Puer Aeternus: A Psychological Study of the Adult Struggle With the Paradise of Childhood - Marie-Louise von Franz\nhttps://amzn.to/3CnSAyK\n‚ñ∂ Now or Neverland: Peter Pan and the Myth of Eternal Youth : A Psychological Perspective on a Cultura - Ann Yeoman\nhttps://amzn.to/3MiAN0w\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüé∂ Music used\n\n1.

Trickster is witty and deceitful. He is the timeless root of all the picaresque creations of world literature, and is not reducible to one single literary entity. Trickster tales have existed since ancient times, and has been said to be at the very foundation of civilisation and culture. They belong to the oldest expressions of mankind. \n\nTricksters are the breakers of rules, agents of mischief, masters of deceit, and boundary crossers. He is an agent of change, and is amoral, not immoral. Trickster is at one and the same time creator and destroyer, giver and negator, he who dupes and who is always duped himself. Psychologically, the trickster is an archetype, part of the collective unconscious. Trickster is everywhere, he is an eternal state of mind. \n\nThe integration of the trickster archetype allows us to go from being ruled by our own self-centred ego to a new way of living, in which one has integrity and relatedness. It allows us to become aware of our true emotions, behaviours, and thoughts, that our unconscious persona is hiding, and without which there is no individuation at all.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/09/16/the-psychology-of-the-trickster\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ The Trickster ‚Äì Paul Radin, Ker√©nyi, and Jung\nhttps://amzn.to/3eTz3OK\n‚ñ∂ Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art ‚Äì Lewis Hyde\nhttps://amzn.to/3xr54Uu\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Swiss psychiatrist and psychologist Jung discovered alchemy and devoted the remaining 30 years of his life to studying it, which he practically dug up from the dunghill of the past, for it was considered pseudoscience, a forgotten relic of history and despised field of investigation which he had suddenly revived. \n\nAlchemy allows one to achieve wholeness through a reconnection with the unconscious. For Jung, the task of alchemy was and has always been psychological. The end product is not material in nature, but rather spiritual. Alchemy is the art of expanding consciousness, of self-realisation.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/07/30/alchemy-and-psychology\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n ‚ñ∂ Jung and the Alchemical Imagination ‚Äì Jeffrey Raff\nhttps://amzn.to/3oN6zYp\n‚ñ∂ Anatomy of the Psyche: Alchemical Symbolism in Psychotherapy ‚Äì Edward Edinger\nhttps://amzn.to/3Sft4D6\n‚ñ∂ Alchemy: An Introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology ‚Äì Marie-Louise von Franz\nhttps://amzn.to/3biinyU\n‚ñ∂ Psychology and Alchemy: Collected Works Vol.12 ‚Äì Carl Jung \nhttps://amzn.to/3zLvWAu\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It is an unconscious mechanism where one ascribes one‚Äôs own motivations, thoughts, feelings, and desires that are unacceptable to oneself, while attributing them to others. It is a misalignment of the inner and outer world, because what one is inwardly, one will see outwardly.\n\nTo really know who we are, we must concern ourselves with correcting such misjudgements. Many people will cling to them with every fibre of their being, because if one accepts correction, one may fall into a depression.\n\nWhen we find certain unacceptable feelings, thoughts or behaviours in ourselves that we refuse to acknowledge, and see someone with that specific trait, we will feel resentment, hatred and anger towards them. Projection occurs not because of what other people say to you, but rather because of what you yourself think about those people.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/06/09/psychological-projection/\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading\n\n ‚ñ∂ Inner Gold: Understanding Psychological Projection\nhttps://amzn.to/3QczvFR\n‚ñ∂ Projection and Re-Collection in Jungian Psychology: Reflections of the Soul\nhttps://amzn.to/3QoWPk3\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols \nhttps://amzn.to/3xAC39D\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

He considered it the most powerful tool to access the unconscious and for achieving wholeness of personality.  \n\nJung discovered this method between the years of 1913 and 1916, a period of disorientation and intense inner turmoil which he called his confrontation with the unconscious. He searched for a method to heal himself from within, through the power of the imagination. Active imagination is a dialogue with different parts of yourself that live in the unconscious. In some way it is similar to dreaming, except that you are fully awake and conscious during the experience. \n\nIf we honestly want to find our own wholeness, to live our individual fate as fully as possible; if we truly want to abolish illusion on principle and find the truth of our own being, however little we like to be the way we are, then there is nothing that can help us so much in our endeavour as active imagination.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/05/09/active-imagination\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Inner Work: Using Dreams and Active Imagination for Personal Growth \nhttps://amzn.to/3t1zDhs\n‚ñ∂ Jung on Active Imagination\nhttps://amzn.to/3MRwSqZ\n‚ñ∂ Encounters with the Soul: Active Imagination as Developed by C.G.

It is whole-making and thus holy and the most important experience of a lifetime.\n\nWe'll be exploring American author and Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson's book, Owning Your Own Shadow: The Dark Side of the Psyche.\n\nIn this video, we briefly clear up some misconceptions regarding the concept of shadow. It is the mirror image of ourselves that we cannot see, representing those aspects that we lack. It has a compensatory role that seeks to restore our wholeness of personality.\n\nIt is not the light element alone that does the healing; the place where light and dark begin to touch is the most profound religious experience we can have in life. The religious task is to restore the wholeness of personality. Religion means to put things back together again, to connect whatever is fractured.  \n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/04/25/owning-your-own-shadow\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche\nhttps://amzn.to/3sYHbS8\n\nüéß Get a 30-day Audible Plus FREE trial (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/332zPzN\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüé∂ Music used \n\n1.

It is an unconscious and blind desire that restlessly strives for more activity. The will is the tornado that swirls inside of us and throws us from one place to the other, it is the source of our insatiable appetite that results in strife and misery.\n\nBut if the world is will, it must be a world of suffering. Each individual bears within himself a disruptive contradiction; the realised desire develops a new desire, and so on endlessly. For Schopenhauer, life is evil because pain is its basic stimulus and reality. Pleasure is merely a negative cessation of pain.\n\nAs soon as suffering ceases, we are overcome by boredom, in other words, more suffering. Boredom is nothing other than the sensation of the emptiness of existence. \n\nSchopenhauer‚Äôs writing is far from the sterile and academic German of the time, his work is straight-forward, colloquial, concrete, full of metaphors and anecdotes. His philosophy sent him on a quest for tranquility and peace of mind. He offers as alternatives the denial of the will, the wisdom of life through philosophy, aesthetics and ethics.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/03/25/philosophy-of-schopenhauer\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1\nhttps://amzn.to/3lR1hd1\n‚ñ∂ The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 2\nhttps://amzn.to/3MW4AeU\n‚ñ∂ Parerga and Paralipomena (Essays and Aphorisms)\nhttps://amzn.to/3LW1DtA\n‚ñ∂ The Wisdom of Life\nhttps://amzn.to/3PHp3pL\n‚ñ∂ On the Suffering of the World \nhttps://amzn.to/3PObWD5\n\nüéß Get a 30-day Audible Plus FREE trial (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/332zPzN\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüé∂ Music used \n\n1.

Many find the notion of nothingness unfathomable. \n\nJapanese philosopher Keiji Nishitani, however, was convinced that the way out of nihilism, that which renders meaningless the meaning of life, could only be reached by gazing into the abyss itself. \n\nNishitani understands human existence as consisting in three fields: consciousness, nihility and emptiness. Nihility is as part of the fabric of reality as Being is, it is relative nothingness, and emptiness is absolute nothingness, where the ‚Äúabsolute negation‚Äù as the negation of negation becomes the ‚Äúgreat affirmation‚Äù. \n\nIn the openness of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ realised by nihility overcoming itself, one completely oversteps the confines of self-consciousness and comes to be free of egocentrism, anthropocentrism and even theocentrism, thus allowing ultimate reality to manifest itself in all its fullness.\n\nWe will be focusing on two important works of Nishitani: The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism and Religion and Nothingness. \n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/03/11/nothingness-nishitani\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Religion and Nothingness\nhttps://amzn.to/3ND4IQs\n‚ñ∂ The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism \nhttps://amzn.to/3N1JiwG\n\nüéß Get a 30-day Audible Plus FREE trial (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/332zPzN\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases at no additional cost to you.\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüé∂ Music used \n\n1.

He was a German-American Christian existentialist philosopher born in 1886 and is considered as one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century. \n\nWhile lecturing on anxiety, Tillich noticed that there was an enormous response in the post-war era, especially in the younger people, and he sought to give an answer to the growing anxiety which had developed. The aftereffects of the two World Wars had left the world in a state of disorientation, estrangement, anxiety and meaninglessness.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/02/24/the-courage-to-be\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ The Courage to Be\nhttps://amzn.to/3M0gp3O\n‚ñ∂ Dynamics of Faith\nhttps://amzn.to/3viWUxl\n‚ñ∂ Systematic Theology: Three Volumes in One\nhttps://amzn.to/3hbjlfF\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

This form of non-anthropocentrism is crucial to the philosophy of Cosmicism.\n\nThe question of the meaning of life was better left unanswered. Cosmicism is a type of extreme existentialism, as it brings up the uncertainty about the role of humanity in the uncaring universe, an existential crisis on a large scale. \n\nLovecraft embraces the truth of reality. Things are important to us on the human scale, but we simply don‚Äôt matter in the cosmos. He described us as \"the miserable denizens of a wretched little flyspeck on the back door of a microscopic universe.‚Äù\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/02/11/cosmicism-lovecraft\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\nThe Complete Fiction of H.P.

His unknown dream paintings were met with blank incomprehension, and were not well-received by the art community of the time, but, viewed today, his vivid paintings bear striking testament to the disruptive and transformative reality of individuation, the purpose of Jungian psychology, which is to seek wholeness of personality by bringing one's unconscious contents into reality.\n\nAfter a midlife crisis, Birkh√§user dedicated himself exclusively to bringing these unconscious images into reality. Just how hard this struggle with himself must have been is suggested by the fact that it took the artist twelve years to make the great break and paint a picture entirely according to his own imagination, with no model from the real world. \n\nBirkh√§user's daughter Eva Wertenschlag is the president of the Birkh√§user-Oeri Foundation, you can visit the works in Basel, Switzlerland.

They form part of the collective unconscious, as archetypes or collectively inherited patterns of behaviour, which are autonomous, making them particularly difficult to integrate into one‚Äôs personality. \n\nThe integration of the shadow, or the realisation of the personal unconscious, marks the first stage in Jungian psychology.

One‚Äôs utopia is another‚Äôs dystopia.\n\nWe‚Äôll be exploring the increasing promotion of equality to the point of it being absurd as a consequence of the ‚Äúunheard cry for meaning‚Äù that plagues modern society. The modern age is characterised by a sense of disorientation of not knowing what to do with one‚Äôs life. Nietzsche‚Äôs foresaw nihilism as an inevitable consequence of the Death of God, where God is replaced with public opinion, the entertainment culture, and the State. Without objective values, we fall into relativism, making us fall prey to authoritarianism and conformism, as displayed by George Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2022/01/10/the-nightmare-of-total-equality\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ The Myth of Sisyphus ‚Äì Albert Camus\nhttps://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra ‚Äì Friedrich Nietzsche\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ 1984 - George Orwell \nhttps://amzn.to/2PH33gT\n‚ñ∂ Animal Farm - George Orwell \nhttps://amzn.to/3thz0RQ\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

But, it also has its dangers. \n\nWe will be discussing the dangers of concealing our true self. We may use the persona to help us conceal our vulnerabilities and other parts that we do not want to reveal about ourselves, or we may excessively identify with the persona.\n\nThe persona prevents us from what Jung considered the most important task in our lives, the process of individuation, bringing one closer to the Self.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/12/24/the-persona-carl-jung\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols (1964)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lYyz94\n‚ñ∂ Modern Man In Search of a Soul (1933)\nhttps://amzn.to/2G3mhw7\n‚ñ∂ Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAcD0z\n‚ñ∂ Two Essays on Analytical Psychology - C.W.

The collective unconscious is the aspect of the unconscious mind which manifests inherited, universal themes which run through all human life. He came upon the idea in a dream.\n\nThe collective unconscious does not owe its existence to personal experience and consequently is not a personal acquisition, while the personal unconscious is made up essentially of contents which have at one time been conscious but which have disappeared from consciousness through having been forgotten or repressed. The personal unconscious consists of complexes, while the collective unconscious is made up of archetypes (or primordial images).\n\nArchetypes are collectively-inherited forms or patterns of behaviour. They reflect basic patterns common to us all, and which have existed universally since the dawn of time. \n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/12/08/carl-jung-collective-unconscious\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols (1964)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lYyz94\n‚ñ∂ Modern Man In Search of a Soul (1933)\nhttps://amzn.to/2G3mhw7\n‚ñ∂ Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAcD0z\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It is an extraordinary piece of literature, social critique and satire of the Russian nihilist movement as well as a novel with deep psychological insights on the nature of man.\n\nDostoevsky‚Äôs most sustained and spirited attack on the Russian nihilist movement is voiced by one of the darkest, least sympathetic of all his characters ‚Äì the nameless narrator and protagonist known as the Underground Man, revealing the hopeless dilemmas in which he lands as a result.\n\nNotes from Underground attempts to warn people of several ideas that were gaining ground in the 1860s including: moral and political nihilism, rational egoism, determinism, utilitarianism, utopianism, atheism and what would become communism. \n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/11/27/the-underground-man-dostoevsky\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Notes from Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n‚ñ∂ Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n‚ñ∂ The Idiot (1869)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n‚ñ∂ Demons (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n‚ñ∂ The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

He defines nihilism as the ‚Äúradical repudiation of value, meaning, and desirability.\" In other words, nihilism consists in an inability to find value and meaning in the higher aspects of this life and world. It empties the world and purpose of human existence. \n\nIn order to overcome nihilism, Nietzsche proposes a ‚Äúrevaluation of all values‚Äù, through concepts such as the √úbermensch, the Will to Power and the Eternal Recurrence, seeking to replace the old values with new ones that focus on life-affirmation, rather than some beyond. He tells us to remain faithful to the earth.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/10/15/nihilism-friedrich-nietzsche\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ The Will to Power \nhttps://amzn.to/3AJcRMy\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

He begins explaining the knight of faith through the story of Abraham and Isaac. \n\nAlthough he has never found any knight of faith, he would not deny on that ground that they exist. He looks like any normal person, one detects nothing of the strangeness and superiority that marks him.\n\nBefore one can be a knight of faith, one must become a knight of infinite resignation, one who renounces that which he most loves in the world. The knight of faith makes the leap of faith and by virtue of the absurd, he renounces everything and regains everything, coming back to his original position through a double movement.\n\nHe compares both movements: the movement of infinite resignation and the movement of faith with the leap of a ballet dancer and gives the example through the story of a man in an impossible love with a princess. The general message is that the notion of faith is so far cheapened that what is talked about is not properly called faith at all. \n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/10/08/kierkegaard-the-knight-of-faith\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ Stages on Life's Way (1845)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wtaJYb\n‚ñ∂ The Present Age (1846)\nhttps://amzn.to/2VsfyDm\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n‚ñ∂ The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ujEitt\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

We can then face the collective shadow and take responsibility to address the denial of important issues and a lack of individual and collective initiative. \n\nTelling the truth is the most desirable way to deal with a difficult past, rather than dismissing the atrocities and having the shadow grow blacker until it can no grow no more, and thus history repeats itself.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/10/01/the-shadow-carl-jung-warning\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols (1964)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lYyz94\n‚ñ∂ Modern Man In Search of a Soul (1933)\nhttps://amzn.to/2G3mhw7\n‚ñ∂ Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAcD0z\n\nExcellent books (in no particular order, choose what interests you)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious - C.W.

We live entirely unique lives with complete different experiences, but we all share one common fate: Death. This is what links all of us together. Death smiles at us all and all we can do is smile back.\n\nIn this video we will analyse death philosophically and psychologically: if it is undesirable, if it is to be feared and the misconceptions around the notion of death.

One of the problems of life is suffering without meaning. Life is pervaded by suffering, and this suffering must be meaningful. It is hard to deny that to live is to suffer, as long as we do not mean that to live is only to suffer. \n\nOne who cannot bear suffering and tries to avoid the unavoidable is bound to end up in existential despair and nihilism, death is just as welcome as there‚Äôs no purpose for living.\n\nThis video explores how to tackle the problem of suffering (\"why do I suffer?\"), with the objective of finding a meaning to one's suffering. There are two ideals: to see suffering as a punishment (ascetic ideal) or to seeing it as something for human growth, flourishing and greatness.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/09/03/the-meaning-of-suffering\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl\nhttps://amzn.to/34aiBkx\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil - Friedrich Nietzsche\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals - Friedrich Nietzsche\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Notes from the Underground - Fyodor Dostoevsky\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols - Carl Jung\nhttps://amzn.to/3lYyz94\n‚ñ∂ The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus\nhttps://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It is a sort of science of seeking pleasures characteristic of the reflective aesthete, and not mindlessly doing it as an unreflective aesthete, such as the legend of Don Juan. \n\nThis method can be done extensively or intensively. The aesthete proposes the intensive cultivation of pleasure as the means to avoid boredom, achieve pleasure and subsequently, happiness. \n\nHowever at the end, it seems that the aesthete's way of approaching happiness is erroneous. For happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n‚ñ∂ The Concept of Anxiety (1844)\nhttps://amzn.to/3mlwJjh\n‚ñ∂ Stages on Life's Way (1845)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wtaJYb\n‚ñ∂  The Present Age (1846)\nhttps://amzn.to/2VsfyDm\n‚ñ∂  Works of Love (1847)\nhttps://amzn.to/31KcwtV\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n‚ñ∂ The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ujEitt\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

To reflect upon the inner voice that conditions our life which is the product of the common conscience of society.\n\nSolitude is but a temporary matter. He also recommends to spend time with people who possess virtues of the love of life, these ‚Äúhigher men‚Äù allow for mental elevation. An individual who isolates himself without ever valuing external opinions will only have his conscience with himself and nobody to ever confront or challenge his views.\n\nSolitude is thus not just a result of the contempt of the masses, but allows to forge a more profound longing for a community that allows one to explore the best version of oneself. Company is important, and if chosen well ‚Äì can be mutually beneficial.\n\nIn this sense, solitude is compatible with life in community, but it is also necessary to retreat into complete solitude once in a while, in order to receive its fruits.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\nüé® Access transcript and artwork gallery: https://eternalisedofficial.com/2021/08/21/nietzsche-living-in-solitude-and-dealing-with-society\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

The appearance of the overman most famously occurs in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. He is declared as ‚Äúthe meaning of the earth‚Äù. The overman is the ultimate form of man, he is one who overcomes nihilism by creating his own values and focusing on this life, not the afterlife. \n\nHe puts all his faith in himself as an autonomous creator and relies on nothing else. He is the pinnacle of self-overcoming, to rise above the human norm and above all difficulties, embracing whatever life throws at you. He is one who overcomes mediocrity and is not afraid to live dangerously. \n\nWe‚Äôll be exploring the translation and origins of the √úbermensch, its connection with Nietzsche‚Äôs early conception of the ‚Äúfree spirit‚Äù, the relation between the three metamorphoses, the tightrope walker, the last man, the higher man, the death of god and we'll finish by comparing it with the eternal recurrence and the will to power, where self-overcoming is what unites everything together.\n\n‚≠ê Become a Patron (exclusive content): https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì∫ YouTube Member (exclusive content): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì® Subscribe with email: https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüìö My personal library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

The 638 aphorisms of Human, All Too Human range from a few words to a few pages, but most are short paragraphs. It represents an unsystematic approach to philosophy, contrary to previous philosophers who tried to have an explanation for everything. This style best represents Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy. \n\nThe work suggests that human fallibilities ‚Äì not strengths ‚Äì are to be the focus of attention. Nietzsche believes that maxims about human nature can help in overcoming life‚Äôs hard moments. There is an implicit drive to overcome what is ‚Äúhuman, all too human‚Äù through philosophy.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It is also one of his most complex concepts as it was never systematically defined in his works, leaving its interpretation open to debate. \n\nThe central point revolves around gaining power over oneself, not others. It is the expression of self-overcoming, becoming who you truly are.\n\nThis video intends to shed light on this concept, tracing all the way back from his psychological insights of the \"desire for power'\" to the conception of \"will to power\", as well as its relationship with the \"will to existence\", \"will to live\" and \"will to truth\".\n\nWe will be focusing on what Nietzsche actually wrote and published himself during his active years, as well as making some references to his posthumously published notes (The Will to Power) where it is appropriate. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

In his scientific works he uses the term ‚Äúthe God-image in the human psyche‚Äù based on the objective language of scientific inquiry, while in this case it is subjective, based on inner experience.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAcD0z\n\nüìö Recommended Reading \n\n‚ñ∂ Modern Man In Search of a Soul (1933)\nhttps://amzn.to/2G3mhw7\n‚ñ∂ Man and His Symbols (1964)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lYyz94\n\nExcellent books (in no particular order, choose what interests you)\n‚ñ∂ The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious - Collected Works Vol.9 Part 1 (1969)\n https://amzn.to/3i93bl9\n‚ñ∂ Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self - C.W.

The story revolves around two men waiting for someone ‚Äì or something ‚Äì named Godot. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.\n\nBeckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature and commended for having ‚Äútransformed the destitution of man into his exaltation‚Äù.\n\nWaiting for Godot belongs to \"The Theatre of the Absurd‚Äù, focusing on absurdist fiction. It shares the existentialist condition that there is no God or superior knowledge we can depend on. However, a major difference from existentialism that it does not share that we can create our own meaning. \n\nIt is better described as an absurdist play. This stems from the absurdist philosophy of Albert Camus, who describes the Absurd in his essay ‚ÄúThe Myth of Sisyphus‚Äù, as the human incapacity of finding meaning in a meaningless world. The characters are doomed to be faced with the Absurd, and all they can do is try to pass the time.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts\nhttps://amzn.to/3wDT8wh\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Dostoevsky's The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, explores the dangers of nihilism and rational egoism, as well as the importance of suffering.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ The Dream of a Ridiculous Man and Other Stories: A Gentle Creature, White Nights.\nhttps://amzn.to/2R6sHzE\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Notes from Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n‚ñ∂ Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n‚ñ∂ The Idiot (1869)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n‚ñ∂ Demons (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n‚ñ∂ The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It is connected with his idea of the Look, which explores the experience of being seen, as we are always under the eyes of others. \n\nThe conflict of being a subject (an agent of one‚Äôs life) and being an object that other people are observing, alienates us and locks us in a particular kind of being, which in turn deprives us of our freedom, because we are unable to escape the ‚Äúdevouring‚Äù gaze of the other. \n\nSartre illustrates the difficult coexistence of people, as the entire social realm is based on adversarial aspects.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ No Exit (1944) and Three Other Plays:\nhttps://amzn.to/33h0dH2\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Nausea (1938)\nhttps://amzn.to/32Srwat\n‚ñ∂ The Wall (1939) and Other Stories \nhttps://amzn.to/2PYlYY0\n‚ñ∂ Being and Nothingness (1943)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ckKl9g\n‚ñ∂ Existentialism is a Humanism (1946)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ckmSoR\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It tells the story of a plague epidemic in the Algerian coastal town of Oran, where thousands of rats are found dead all over the city.\n\nCamus‚Äôs absurdist philosophy is at the background of the novel. He stresses the powerlessness of the individual to affect his destiny in an indifferent world. \n\nIllness, exile, and separation are themes that were present in Camus‚Äôs life and his reflections upon them form a vital counterpoint to the allegory. This makes his description of the plague and the pain of loneliness exceptionally vivid and heartfelt. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ The Plague (1947)\nhttps://amzn.to/2SG5j9L\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Stranger (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/33KgLaD\n‚ñ∂ The Myth of Sisyphus (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n‚ñ∂ The Rebel (1951)\nhttps://amzn.to/2GPA21k\n‚ñ∂ The Fall (1956)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lL3JzZ\n‚ñ∂ A Happy Death (1971)\nhttps://amzn.to/3rQdnUr\n‚ñ∂ The First Man (1994)\nhttps://amzn.to/33OWqBa\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüì∫ Odysee ‚ûî https://odysee.com/@eternalised\nüì∫ Rumble ‚ûî https://rumble.com/c/Eternalised\nüê¶ Twitter ‚ûî https://twitter.com/eternalised1\nüì∑ Instagram ‚ûî https://www.instagram.com/eternalised_official\nüìò Facebook ‚ûî https://www.facebook.com/eternalised\nüéß Podcast ‚ûî https://anchor.fm/eternalised\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\n‚åõ Timestamps \n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:53 Part I\n3:32 Part II\n6:59 Part III\n7:25 Part IV\n8:58 Part V\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìù Sources\n\n- The Plague (1991).

It has been called one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century as well as a classic absurdist fiction book.\n\nIt starts off with one of the most iconic opening lines in literature: ‚ÄúAs Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.‚Äù\n\nFranz Kafka's Metamorphosis embodies an absurdist tone with ordinary daily concerns (such as being late for work) even after Gregor Samsa's extraordinary transformation into a monstrous vermin. It is an allegory of modern society's alienation and angst. The story mostly takes place in a single confined room. \n\nThe cause of Gregor‚Äôs transformation is never revealed, and Kafka himself never gave an explanation. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ The Metamorphosis (1915)\nhttps://amzn.to/3xADHpu\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Trial (1925)\nhttps://amzn.to/3gO3QLJ\n‚ñ∂ The Castle (1926)\nhttps://amzn.to/3aPepu3\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Both books should be read under the aspect of the last words of his final original book, his autobiography Ecce Homo: ‚ÄúDionysus against the Crucified.‚Äù\n\nThe German title can be translated as either ‚ÄúThe Anti-Christ‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Anti-Christian‚Äù. It was likely meant to mean both. Dionysus has two opponents, one worthy of him, the other unworthy. The name Nietzsche gives to his worthy opponent is Christ ‚Äì hence Dionysus is the Anti-Christ. As Nietzsche discusses Christ, the tone becomes ever warmer and even ecstatic. It becomes one of the most moving and powerful parts of the book. The unworthy opponent is the Christian, who is undeservedly dignified by being treated to such elaborate condemnation. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Through the biblical story of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, Kierkegaard, as a great explorer of human psychology, looks into the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God commanded him to offer his son as a human sacrifice. \n\nKierkegaard used the term angst to refer to the dizzying awareness of one‚Äôs freedom of choice. It is the anxiety of freedom when considering infinite possibilities and the immense responsibility of being able to choose. This proved to be very influential in Existentialism.\n\nFear and Trembling contains some of Kierkegaard most important concepts such as the knight of infinite resignation, the knight of faith, the leap of faith, the teleological suspension of the ethical and the stages on life‚Äôs way (aesthetic, ethical, religious).\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ The Concept of Anxiety (1844)\nhttps://amzn.to/3mlwJjh\n‚ñ∂ Stages on Life's Way (1845)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wtaJYb\n‚ñ∂ The Present Age (1846)\nhttps://amzn.to/2VsfyDm\n‚ñ∂  Works of Love (1847)\nhttps://amzn.to/31KcwtV\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n‚ñ∂ The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ujEitt\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Existentialism is a philosophy that explores the problem of human existence, with an emphasis on the individual who starts in an apparently meaningless world, and who seeks to create meaning in a world without inherent meaning.\n\nExistentialism is most commonly associated with several 19th and 20th century philosophers: S√∏ren  Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus.\n\nMany of these thinkers never used the term ‚Äúexistentialist‚Äù to describe themselves, some of them even rejected the label, while others accepted it. What they did share is a common template. Many of them regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies too abstract and remote from concrete human experience and focused on the authenticity of the individual.\n\nDanish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard is regarded as the father of existentialism, who along with Nietzsche, provided the basic foundations of 19th century Existentialism. \n\nCore ideas to Existentialism include authenticity, individuality, subjectivity, freedom and responsibility, in order to understand and pursue the meaning of your life.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\nDostoevsky\n‚ñ∂ Notes from the Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n‚ñ∂ Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n‚ñ∂ The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\nNietzsche\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n\nKierkegaard\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n\nCamus\n‚ñ∂ The Stranger (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/33KgLaD\n‚ñ∂ The Myth of Sisyphus (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n‚ñ∂ The Plague (1947)\nhttps://amzn.to/2SG5j9L\n\nSartre\n‚ñ∂ Nausea (1938)\nhttps://amzn.to/32Srwat\n‚ñ∂ The Wall (1939) and Other Stories \nhttps://amzn.to/2PYlYY0\n‚ñ∂ No Exit (1944) and Three Other Plays:\nhttps://amzn.to/33h0dH2\n\nHeidegger\n‚ñ∂ The Question concerning Technology (1954)\nhttps://amzn.to/3nWRZuz\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

They can both be considered as the Giants of Existentialism.\n\nExistentialism is a philosophy that emphasises the existence of the individual as a free and responsible agent determining their own development. \n\nKierkegaard (commonly regarded as the Father of Existentialism) and Nietzsche ended up savagely criticising Christianity, recognising that God no longer exists in the minds of most people. People live falsely religious lives and follow a herd mentality.\n\nIn much Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are alike, in the moral decline of society and the corruption of religion, in their existential orientation and in their psychological interests, however they were absolutely opposed on what it means to live a human life to the fullest. This is largely precipitated by Nietzsche‚Äôs complete disillusionment with religion in contrast to Kierkegaard‚Äôs continued faith in the existence of God. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\nKierkegaard\n\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n‚ñ∂ The Concept of Anxiety (1844)\nhttps://amzn.to/3mlwJjh\n‚ñ∂ Stages on Life's Way (1845)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wtaJYb\n‚ñ∂  Works of Love (1847)\nhttps://amzn.to/31KcwtV\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n‚ñ∂ The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ujEitt\n\nNietzsche\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It gave rise to the philosophy of Absurdism, sharing some concepts with Existentialism and Nihilism.\n\nThe fundamental concern of the book is the notion of the Absurd, which is best described as ‚Äúthe conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless, and irrational universe.‚Äù \n\nCamus draws from the absurd three consequences: revolt (we must not accept any answer or reconciliation in our struggle), freedom (we are absolutely free to think and behave as we choose), and passion (we must pursue a life of rich and diverse experiences).\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus explores the value of life in a world devoid of religious meaning. His work can be seen as a reply to Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ The Myth of Sisyphus (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jQxA9n\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Stranger (1942)\nhttps://amzn.to/33KgLaD\n‚ñ∂ The Plague (1947)\nhttps://amzn.to/2SG5j9L\n‚ñ∂ The Rebel (1951)\nhttps://amzn.to/2GPA21k\n‚ñ∂ The Fall (1956)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lL3JzZ\n‚ñ∂ A Happy Death (1971)\nhttps://amzn.to/3rQdnUr\n‚ñ∂ The First Man (1994)\nhttps://amzn.to/33OWqBa\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It remains as one of the most important works of existentialist literature. In this work Dostoevsky attempts to justify the existence of individual freedom as a necessary part of humankind.\n\nThe novel consists of two parts. The first one, titled simply ‚ÄúUnderground‚Äù is told through an unnamed narrator, known as the Underground Man. This part serves as an introduction into the mind of the Underground Man. The second part of the novel is called \"Apropos of the Wet Snow‚Äù, where he begins to recount his troubled past experiences when he was 24 years old. His inability to interact with other people causes his attempts to form relationships and participate in life to end in disaster and drives him deeper underground.\n\nNotes from the Underground launches an attack on all ideologies of social progress which aspire to the elimination of suffering (which cannot be eradicated), solving one problem and directing our nature to become unhappy in other ways. It is a novel against Utilitarianism, Utopianism & Rational Egoism.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìò The Book\n\n‚ñ∂ Notes from the Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n\nüìö  Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n‚ñ∂ The Idiot (1869)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n‚ñ∂ Demons (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n‚ñ∂ The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\nüìö  Other Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Best Short Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky: White Nights (1848), An Honest Thief (1848), Notes from the Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/3cNl9dw\n‚ñ∂ A Gentle Creature (1876) and Other Stories: White Nights (1848), The Dream of a Ridiculous Man (1877)\nhttps://amzn.to/2R6sHzE\n‚ñ∂ The Gambler (1866) and Other Stories: Bobok (1873), The Dream of a Ridiculous Man (1877), A Christmas Tree and a Wedding (1848), A Nasty Story (1862), A Gentle Creature (1876)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wCWeBk\n‚ñ∂ Poor Folk (1846) and Other Stories: The Landlady (1847), Mr. Prokharchin (1846)\nhttps://amzn.to/39INaRs\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Zazen or ‚Äúseated meditation‚Äù is the primary practice of the Zen Buddhist tradition. Unlike religion, Zen does not mention God, it does not try to explain how the world was created and what happens after death.\n\nIt highlights meditation as a way of experiencing basic reality. Sitting quietly, going deep and asking the question: What am I? That is the fundamental question in Zen. It begins with the curiosity and wonder of who you are. \n\nBe present and see what is happening, not your fantasy about what is happening but seeing what‚Äôs actually happening and then responding. That in a nutshell, is Zen practice, and Zen life.

Nietzsche on the other hand, not only knew some of Dostoevsky‚Äôs principal works, but actually acknowledged that he regarded him as the only psychologist from whom he had anything to learn.\n\nNietzsche and Dostoevsky together both had strikingly similar themes, both were haunted by central questions surrounding the human existence, especially ones concerning God. They were both keen questioners and doubters.  Both were ‚Äúunderworld minds‚Äù unable to come to terms either with other people or with the conditions they saw around them and both of them desperately wanted to create truth.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\nNietzsche\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nDostoevsky\n\n‚ñ∂ Notes from the Underground (1864)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DBRXas\n‚ñ∂ Crime and Punishment (1866)\nhttps://amzn.to/3h2BIks\n‚ñ∂ The Idiot (1869)\nhttps://amzn.to/3bxKFRK\n‚ñ∂ Demons (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/2FexadH\n‚ñ∂ The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\nhttps://amzn.to/324Kiem\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Nietzsche frequently laughs and he especially recommends laughing at oneself. He does not speak of just any laugh, but of a laugh that comes from the depths of man. It is from that depth that one must learn to laugh the superhuman laugh. This laughter arises from the state of anguish and suffering. This is Nietzsche's answer to the absurdity of life and the comedy of existence.\n\nIndeed, comedy must be included within the very art that Nietzsche proclaims is: ‚Äúthe highest task and the true metaphysical activity of this life.‚Äù\n\nPerhaps best expressed in his masterpiece Thus Spoke Zarathustra, where the prophet Zarathustra, talks about the ‚Äúlaughter of the herd‚Äù and the ‚Äúlaughter of the height‚Äù. Other books worthy of mention are: The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil and The Will to Power.\n\nRecommended video: Nietzsche's Laughter of the Herd and Laughter of the Height (Make sure to subscribe to The Living Philosophy!)\n‚ñ∂ https://youtu.be/EEB2JSwz_qk\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Most famously expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus. Sisyphus is the ultimate Absurd Man,  a man condemned by the gods to a lifetime of rolling a boulder up a hill, only to reach the top of the hill and have the boulder inevitably roll back down to the bottom for him to start all over again.\n\nCamus argued against the ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù of Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky considering it as ‚Äúphilosophical suicide‚Äù. His response to the absurd is to revolt, which he considers as the only coherent philosophical position.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Myth of Sisyphus - Camus\nhttps://amzn.to/36bTIFR\n‚ñ∂ Sickness unto Death - Kierkegaard\nhttps://amzn.to/3jMgzfT\n‚ñ∂ Demons - Dostoevsky\nhttps://amzn.to/3kTOl3W\n‚ñ∂ Brothers Karamazov - Dostoevsky\nhttps://amzn.to/3kLC7ue\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

Stoicism is a philosophy most popularly associated with Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. \n\nThe supreme goal being ‚Äúliving in agreement with nature‚Äù, allowing us to flow through life smoothly and with inner peace, flourishing as individuals and fulfilling our own human nature, achieving eudaimonia, commonly referred to as ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù, although a better translation would be ‚Äúfulfilment‚Äù. \n\nOne of Stoicism‚Äôs main misconceptions is that it may seem cold-hearted or unemotional. This is simply not the case. In the beginning of Marcus‚Äô Meditations, he spends a whole chapter reminding himself of the most important things about the most important people in his life, his family, and teachers. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Meditations - Marcus Aurelius\nhttps://amzn.to/35G2Tzk\n‚ñ∂ Discourses and Selected Writings - Epictetus\nhttps://amzn.to/3urYOIv\n‚ñ∂ Letters from a Stoic - Seneca\nhttps://amzn.to/3fUKnbZ\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy \nhttps://amzn.to/2RlNFr2\n‚ñ∂ The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living https://amzn.to/35g784r\n‚ñ∂ The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\nhttps://amzn.to/327S5bm\n‚ñ∂ The Obstacle Is the Way \nhttps://amzn.to/337hXTR\n‚ñ∂ How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\nhttps://amzn.to/3kaTBzS\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

It seems that he studied this material closely and appreciated it greatly.\n\nThroughout Nietzsche‚Äôs books and notes, he refers to different aspects of Eastern philosophy on more than four hundred occasions, and in several of these he claims to be interested in it. \n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

He wrote about how we choose to live and what it means to be alive, centred in the individual or ‚Äúexisting being‚Äù. He is regarded as the father of Existentialism. The stress of subjectivity is one of Kierkegaard‚Äôs main contributions.\n\nHis concept of anxiety or angst is one of the most profound pre-Freudian works of psychology. His most popular work includes the leap of faith, the concept of angst, the three stages on life (aesthetic, ethical, religious), among others.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüé¶ Subscribe to the official clips channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3O94sXcoZLpoHRzxH_YcTA\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Either/Or (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dAg9YP\n‚ñ∂ Fear and Trembling (1843)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jUGhPx\n‚ñ∂ The Concept of Anxiety (1844)\nhttps://amzn.to/3mlwJjh\n‚ñ∂ Stages on Life's Way (1845)\nhttps://amzn.to/3wtaJYb\n‚ñ∂ The Present Age (1846)\nhttps://amzn.to/2VsfyDm\n‚ñ∂ Works of Love (1847)\nhttps://amzn.to/31KcwtV\n‚ñ∂ The Sickness unto Death (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3j8oLrd\n‚ñ∂ The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air (1849)\nhttps://amzn.to/3ujEitt\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

An ancient pragmatic philosophy that has gained rapid popularity in modern times. It teaches us self-control and fortitude as a means for overcoming destructive emotions.\n\nA big challenge in today's  modern and highly technological era is people seeking attention, feeling ashamed or lack self confidence. \n\nFocus on the things you can control. Stoicism can help us find calmness in a world filled with pain, anxiety, and insatiable desires. This can be achieved by focusing on controlling our internal world, how our mind reacts to the external reality.\n\nAnd this can be attained by accepting reality as it is, being indifferent to what we cannot control and pursuing our own self-improvement. To Stoicism, this is how we remain happy and satisfied with ourselves.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\n‚ñ∂ Meditations - Marcus Aurelius\nhttps://amzn.to/35G2Tzk\n‚ñ∂ Discourses and Selected Writings - Epictetus\nhttps://amzn.to/3urYOIv\n‚ñ∂ Letters from a Stoic - Seneca\nhttps://amzn.to/3fUKnbZ\n\nüìö Other Recommended Reading\n\n‚ñ∂ A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy \nhttps://amzn.to/2RlNFr2\n‚ñ∂ The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living https://amzn.to/35g784r\n‚ñ∂ The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\nhttps://amzn.to/327S5bm\n‚ñ∂ The Obstacle Is the Way \nhttps://amzn.to/337hXTR\n‚ñ∂ How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\nhttps://amzn.to/3kaTBzS\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?

However, he was an atheist and did not ever suggest returning to these values. Nietzsche did not lament the decline of the values, and certainly did not suggest returning to them if possible.\n\n‚≠ê Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/eternalised\nüì® Subscribe with email https://eternalisedofficial.com/subscribe\nüì∫ YouTube Member Perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA/join\n‚òï Donate a Coffee: https://ko-fi.com/eternalised\nüìò PayPal https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/eternalisedofficial\nüõí Official Merch: https://eternalised.creator-spring.com\nüìö My Personal Library: https://eternalisedofficial.com/library\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nüìö Recommended Reading (High Quality and Best Translations)\n\nJordan Peterson\n\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life\nhttps://amzn.to/3cPKvY7\n‚ñ∂ 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote to Chaos \nhttps://amzn.to/35drLyr\n‚ñ∂ Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\nhttps://amzn.to/36AhSf1\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\n‚ñ∂ The Birth of Tragedy (1872)\nhttps://amzn.to/3uohsRi\n‚ñ∂ Human, All Too Human (1878)\nhttps://amzn.to/2PDOmP7\n‚ñ∂ The Dawn of Day (1881)\nhttps://amzn.to/3dyAE87\n‚ñ∂ The Gay Science (1882)\nhttps://amzn.to/36rijIf\n‚ñ∂ Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883)\nhttps://amzn.to/2F89V55\n‚ñ∂ Beyond Good and Evil (1886)\nhttps://amzn.to/2DDjLLL\n‚ñ∂ On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)\nhttps://amzn.to/3jj0izq\n‚ñ∂ Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophise with a Hammer and The Antichrist (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ol1Miq\n‚ñ∂ Ecce Homo (1888)\nhttps://amzn.to/39L9j1E\n\nüéß Prefer Audiobooks?
