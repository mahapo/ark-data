you"},{"startMs":280080,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"just said"},{"startMs":281340,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"um you mentioned this mindfulness in a"},{"startMs":283979,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"secular context"},{"startMs":285720,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and I believe you've given talks on"},{"startMs":289020,"durationMs":5399,"subtitle":"Buddhism as a secular phenomenon so"},{"startMs":292320,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"could you explain what you mean by that"},{"startMs":294419,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"well it's almost as if these people they"},{"startMs":297240,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"Define themselves in a sense and uh"},{"startMs":299699,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"they're you know they are secular"},{"startMs":301139,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"Buddhist communities in the US and they"},{"startMs":302699,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"have their own you know communities and"},{"startMs":305100,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"you know if you go on the

taking"},{"startMs":310740,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"out what they would consider the"},{"startMs":312540,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"religious elements of the Buddhist"},{"startMs":314820,"durationMs":4439,"subtitle":"teachings and that means especially what"},{"startMs":317580,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"I mean there's many things that might be"},{"startMs":319259,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"considered uh non-reli might be"},{"startMs":322020,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"considered religious and therefore not"},{"startMs":323580,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"really acceptable but the main things"},{"startMs":326280,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"they are concerned about are things like"},{"startMs":327600,"durationMs":5099,"subtitle":"rebirth and Karma yeah Karma being the"},{"startMs":330780,"durationMs":4919,"subtitle":"the kind of the driving force behind"},{"startMs":332699,"durationMs":5101,"subtitle":"rebirth if you like yeah and uh and that"},{"startMs":335699,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"is very problematic because these are"},{"startMs":337800,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"core ideas in Buddhism and I the problem"},{"startMs":339840,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"is that once you do that take those"},{"startMs":341639,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"things out you're really throwing out"},{"startMs":343620,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"Buddhism wholesale and there's nothing"},{"startMs":345240,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"left of Buddhism because these things"},{"startMs":346740,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"are so core they're so fundamental to"},{"startMs":348539,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"the whole outlook if you take them out"},{"startMs":350639,"durationMs":3421,"subtitle":"the whole thing started it collapses it"},{"startMs":352740,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"becomes like the house of cardi taking"},{"startMs":354060,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"up the foundation nation of the whole"},{"startMs":355259,"durationMs":3181,"subtitle":"thing here so there are many things that"},{"startMs":357060,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"would reject I mean there's many things"},{"startMs":358440,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"in Buddhism which may seem very strange"},{"startMs":360780,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"from Modern point of view things like"},{"startMs":362460,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"you know psychic powers and these kind"},{"startMs":364500,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"of things and it is not core aspect of"},{"startMs":366720,"durationMs":3419,"subtitle":"Buddhism anyway it doesn't matter yeah"},{"startMs":368220,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"but there are some things that are core"},{"startMs":370139,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"and then it becomes very problematic"},{"startMs":372180,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"yeah and it has consequences that are"},{"startMs":375539,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"quite far-reaching as well one of the"},{"startMs":378960,"durationMs":4739,"subtitle":"things that it means is that monasticism"},{"startMs":380580,"durationMs":6119,"subtitle":"is considered really not necessary yeah"},{"startMs":383699,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"monasticism is a great investment in

the"},{"startMs":395520,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"context when you are you know when"},{"startMs":397919,"durationMs":3421,"subtitle":"there's something much a bigger

which"},{"startMs":413400,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"is this whole sequence of rebirths and"},{"startMs":416039,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"then the idea of you know giving up

that you're talking"},{"startMs":464520,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"about"},{"startMs":466319,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"could almost be redefined as

say"},{"startMs":519360,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"I think also it may come from a"},{"startMs":521940,"durationMs":5459,"subtitle":"misunderstanding of the nature of the"},{"startMs":525120,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"idea of rebirth in Buddhism"},{"startMs":527399,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"because what you will hear that

isn't"},{"startMs":1357799,"durationMs":6421,"subtitle":"well to go on to the subject of karma uh"},{"startMs":1360980,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"from what I gather"},{"startMs":1364220,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"from Buddhist teaching is that you have"},{"startMs":1366740,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"called this kind of stream of"},{"startMs":1368059,"durationMs":5041,"subtitle":"Consciousness I believe it's sometimes"},{"startMs":1369620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"called mindstream that is the vehicle

could"},{"startMs":1379100,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"you explain that yeah yeah you could say"},{"startMs":1381080,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"that I I think karma is actually a"},{"startMs":1383179,"durationMs":5221,"subtitle":"fairly simple idea to understand once"},{"startMs":1385760,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"you frame it in the right way I mean"},{"startMs":1388400,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"normally karma is kind of considered"},{"startMs":1390020,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"like a almost like a magical thing you"},{"startMs":1392539,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"die you've done good things and so you"},{"startMs":1394220,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"kind of you have a happy existence"},{"startMs":1395539,"durationMs":2821,"subtitle":"afterwards you get a nice car in a nice"},{"startMs":1397100,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"house and that's kind of how does it how"},{"startMs":1398360,"durationMs":3299,"subtitle":"does this connect right that doesn't"},{"startMs":1399500,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"seem to make any sense why should we get"},{"startMs":1401659,"durationMs":5461,"subtitle":"the nice car just because you were a"},{"startMs":1403280,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"nice guy in your past life but the idea"},{"startMs":1407120,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"where it is easy to understand is that"},{"startMs":1409580,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"the Buddha talks about three kinds of"},{"startMs":1410900,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"karma three kinds of karma the one that"},{"startMs":1413539,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"ripens in this life the one that ripens"},{"startMs":1415700,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"in your next life and the one that"},{"startMs":1417559,"durationMs":5581,"subtitle":"represents lives beyond that"},{"startMs":1419600,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"so what is now the most interesting one"},{"startMs":1423140,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"here for our purpose is the one that"},{"startMs":1424280,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"ripens in this life because maybe we can"},{"startMs":1425840,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"make some sense of that one right future"},{"startMs":1427700,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"life okay it's a bit more difficult so"},{"startMs":1429980,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"what is that then and what it is I think"},{"startMs":1433760,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"and I think this is fairly obvious once"},{"startMs":1435260,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"you understand kind of the karma is the"},{"startMs":1437659,"durationMs":4621,"subtitle":"idea of how intention or volition the"},{"startMs":1439760,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"will has consequences yeah for how we"},{"startMs":1442280,"durationMs":3779,"subtitle":"feel about ourselves and it's obvious if"},{"startMs":1444620,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"you start to look into your own mind you"},{"startMs":1446059,"durationMs":4381,"subtitle":"know that how you live in this world"},{"startMs":1448520,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"does have consequences for how you feel"},{"startMs":1450440,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"about yourself if you live a rotten life"},{"startMs":1452480,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"treat other people badly you start

of"},{"startMs":1463400,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"the basic idea of karma right here in"},{"startMs":1465919,"durationMs":6061,"subtitle":"this life you do bad karma you have bad"},{"startMs":1469100,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"intentions bad ideas volitions are"},{"startMs":1471980,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"motivated by dark Forces in your mind"},{"startMs":1474140,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"and you just feel bad about yourself"},{"startMs":1475400,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"it's as simple as that"},{"startMs":1477140,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and so then if you live a life well you"},{"startMs":1479419,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"do a lot of good karma what you're doing"},{"startMs":1481340,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"is you're building up all of these good"},{"startMs":1483320,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"feelings within you feeling good

good"},{"startMs":1488539,"durationMs":2941,"subtitle":"about yourself and then it kind of drops"},{"startMs":1489740,"durationMs":4679,"subtitle":"down to where you'll be before no

maybe"},{"startMs":1516620,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"there is an element there by which you"},{"startMs":1519080,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"know the body falls away so the the"},{"startMs":1520940,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"karma ripens even more powerful in these"},{"startMs":1522980,"durationMs":3179,"subtitle":"kind of things but the basic idea is"},{"startMs":1524600,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"there you have built up a bright mind"},{"startMs":1526159,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and then when you die that falls

to"},{"startMs":1590720,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"say about that"},{"startMs":1592940,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"not really yeah yeah"},{"startMs":1595000,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"karma is

so"},{"startMs":1605620,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"but the question is how do we explain"},{"startMs":1608240,"durationMs":4559,"subtitle":"these things then yeah like you know"},{"startMs":1610220,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"everyone dies in an earthquake or we had"},{"startMs":1612799,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"the famous tsunamis 2003 or

the"},{"startMs":1626659,"durationMs":6061,"subtitle":"answer is that everything is not karma"},{"startMs":1628700,"durationMs":5579,"subtitle":"that's the answer yeah okay all you

that"},{"startMs":2081820,"durationMs":3539,"subtitle":"you find in most religions and that is"},{"startMs":2083919,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"precisely the fact that they are

kind"},{"startMs":2111099,"durationMs":5701,"subtitle":"of the uh the theistic ones and there is"},{"startMs":2114760,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"a very important thing that comes out

about"},{"startMs":2947380,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"so what Awakening is about then and the"},{"startMs":2949960,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"way to find this happen is is to

you"},{"startMs":3175260,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"understand the idea of non-self from"},{"startMs":3177900,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"that comes the giving up of the what we"},{"startMs":3180300,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"call the defilements yeah there's"},{"startMs":3181800,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"another way of thinking about the

they"},{"startMs":3194280,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"can only go when the ego is seen through"},{"startMs":3196380,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"with that as long as the ego is there"},{"startMs":3198240,"durationMs":5819,"subtitle":"the one of the things that the ego does"},{"startMs":3201540,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"is that it wants to amass things in the"},{"startMs":3204059,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"world it wants to make itself happy it"},{"startMs":3205920,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"wants to make itself powerful this is"},{"startMs":3207420,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"what egos do and that is where desire"},{"startMs":3209700,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"and all of these things come out and"},{"startMs":3211380,"durationMs":3239,"subtitle":"because it wants to protect itself anger"},{"startMs":3213180,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and all of these things also come out of"},{"startMs":3214619,"durationMs":6121,"subtitle":"that so but once the ego is seen through"},{"startMs":3217440,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and once you understand that the will is"},{"startMs":3220740,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"not actually a positive thing we in the"},{"startMs":3224040,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"Western World We Worship the world we"},{"startMs":3226140,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"worship creativity right creativity is"},{"startMs":3227940,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"an act of the will and uh and but"},{"startMs":3231000,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"actually in one Buddhist point of view"},{"startMs":3232440,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"you start to say that this actually is a"},{"startMs":3234480,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"problem a peaceful mind is far"},{"startMs":3236520,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"preferable to any action of the"},{"startMs":3238740,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"wilderness"},{"startMs":3239700,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"and so when all of these things kind of"},{"startMs":3241800,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"fall into place that is where you can"},{"startMs":3244079,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"give up all desires and all anger and"},{"startMs":3246420,"durationMs":4199,"subtitle":"all ill will precisely because the ego"},{"startMs":3249000,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"is gone as long as the sense of self is"},{"startMs":3250619,"durationMs":4381,"subtitle":"still there as long as you think that is"},{"startMs":3252540,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"a permanent aspect to your mind

reach"},{"startMs":3259440,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"another aspect of that Awakening is the"},{"startMs":3261240,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"idea of having giving up all defilements"},{"startMs":3263339,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"so the highest happiness is the giving"},{"startMs":3265559,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"up or the sense of self is the giving up"},{"startMs":3267420,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"of all defilements uh then it is a"},{"startMs":3270839,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"giving up or the rebirth process

yeah"},{"startMs":3463160,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"yes"},{"startMs":3465119,"durationMs":4921,"subtitle":"um the first thing I would say to people"},{"startMs":3467220,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"is that sometimes people have bad"},{"startMs":3470040,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"experiences in meditation and they don't"},{"startMs":3472559,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"enjoy it in fact they they actually the"},{"startMs":3475200,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"opposite of enjoying it like an"},{"startMs":3476460,"durationMs":4619,"subtitle":"unpleasant experience for them so I"},{"startMs":3478740,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"would remind people that meditation is"},{"startMs":3481079,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"not the most important thing in in"},{"startMs":3483059,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"Buddhism yeah if there are if they are"},{"startMs":3484619,"durationMs":2821,"subtitle":"interested Buddhism that's not the most"},{"startMs":3485700,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"important thing the most important thing"},{"startMs":3487440,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"is immorality in ethics to be a kind"},{"startMs":3489540,"durationMs":4019,"subtitle":"person that is the most important thing"},{"startMs":3491220,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"here and if there are people in the"},{"startMs":3493559,"durationMs":3601,"subtitle":"world who do meditation we talk about"},{"startMs":3495000,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"this at the beginning without ethics and"},{"startMs":3497160,"durationMs":3959,"subtitle":"that's kind of crazy because it's in the"},{"startMs":3500040,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"end it's not going to lead you anywhere"},{"startMs":3501119,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"and it's going to have detrimental"},{"startMs":3502680,"durationMs":5159,"subtitle":"effects but if you are just kind that on"},{"startMs":3505559,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"its own will have good positive effects"},{"startMs":3507839,"durationMs":3661,"subtitle":"yeah so that is the most important part"},{"startMs":3509819,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"and even if you can just live a Pure"},{"startMs":3511500,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"Life of kindness you're going to go a"},{"startMs":3512940,"durationMs":3899,"subtitle":"long way on this path that was the first"},{"startMs":3515700,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"thing so the first thing is don't"},{"startMs":3516839,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"actually have to do meditation"},{"startMs":3518579,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"the second thing I will say is that the"},{"startMs":3520920,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"bar very low when you start out start"},{"startMs":3523260,"durationMs":4799,"subtitle":"out very gently with yourself you have"},{"startMs":3525420,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"no idea how you're going to react say"},{"startMs":3528059,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"start out with five or ten minutes yeah"},{"startMs":3530040,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"once a week yeah very very simple just"},{"startMs":3533579,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"to try it and see what happens and very"},{"startMs":3535980,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"quickly within of two or three weeks you"},{"startMs":3537660,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"will realize whether this is something"},{"startMs":3538740,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"for you or not and then you can maybe do"},{"startMs":3541020,"durationMs":5039,"subtitle":"it three times a week every other day or"},{"startMs":3543420,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"something like that so you go very very"},{"startMs":3546059,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"gently with yourself yeah this is kind"},{"startMs":3547799,"durationMs":5701,"subtitle":"of the first thing here the second thing"},{"startMs":3549960,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"is to remember that yes mindfulness or"},{"startMs":3553500,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"breathing being aware of the breath is"},{"startMs":3555540,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"kind of one of the fundamental uh ideas"},{"startMs":3557640,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"on Buddhist Meditation practice but you"},{"startMs":3560220,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"have to set yourself up in the right way"},{"startMs":3562380,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"before you can do the mindfulness of"},{"startMs":3564299,"durationMs":2641,"subtitle":"breathing mindfulness of breathing is"},{"startMs":3565740,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"actually not very easy it's actually"},{"startMs":3566940,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"quite a surprisingly difficult thing to"},{"startMs":3569579,"durationMs":6901,"subtitle":"do and so setting yourself up means like"},{"startMs":3573540,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"giving actually becoming mindful before"},{"startMs":3576480,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"you start the meditation yeah it means"},{"startMs":3578700,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"kind of allowing the mind to be"},{"startMs":3580200,"durationMs":3359,"subtitle":"reasonably calm and quiet before you"},{"startMs":3582180,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"actually sit down and do these kind of"},{"startMs":3583559,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"things and this is why it is tricky so I"},{"startMs":3587940,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"what I often tell people is that you"},{"startMs":3589799,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"have to use certain perceptions to help"},{"startMs":3591420,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"you in getting in the right mood of"},{"startMs":3593940,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"meditation yeah you don't want to put"},{"startMs":3595500,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"forth too much effort it has to be"},{"startMs":3597780,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"relaxed it has to be easy going so in"},{"startMs":3600420,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"the beginning you sit down in a nice"},{"startMs":3601980,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"armchair yeah"},{"startMs":3603780,"durationMs":3539,"subtitle":"and we have a kind of a good example"},{"startMs":3606059,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"right here so we sit down in a nice"},{"startMs":3607319,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"armchair and one of the kind of examples"},{"startMs":3609599,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"or ideas I give people is the idea that"},{"startMs":3611819,"durationMs":4141,"subtitle":"well what do you do if you come home"},{"startMs":3614339,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"after a long day at work and you're"},{"startMs":3615960,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"really tired and exhausted and what do"},{"startMs":3617579,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"you do then well you may sit down in

you're"},{"startMs":3633720,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"exhausted and that is meditation"},{"startMs":3635819,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"allowing the mind to flow and"},{"startMs":3639000,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"once you get that idea that is about"},{"startMs":3640559,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"allowing the mind to flow instead of"},{"startMs":3642540,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"controlling the mind then you're on the"},{"startMs":3644760,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"right track because the vast majority of"},{"startMs":3646859,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"people they control the mind too much if"},{"startMs":3649920,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"you sit down and you start watching the"},{"startMs":3651359,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"breath straight away guaranteed you're"},{"startMs":3653160,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"going to control the mind because it's"},{"startMs":3654720,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"impossible because you haven't got"},{"startMs":3656040,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"enough mindfulness to follow the breath"},{"startMs":3657720,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"there so you learn to just relax and"},{"startMs":3660660,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"even if all we get out of your"},{"startMs":3662040,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"meditation is a bit of relaxation you're"},{"startMs":3663720,"durationMs":4139,"subtitle":"still going to enjoy it yeah so you just"},{"startMs":3665640,"durationMs":4199,"subtitle":"learn to relax there and then if you as"},{"startMs":3667859,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you relax and you can do this to wait"},{"startMs":3669839,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"and you you nudge the mind a little bit"},{"startMs":3671819,"durationMs":2821,"subtitle":"like I can't go into too many

in"},{"startMs":3676140,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that way and as you do that mindfulness"},{"startMs":3678480,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"may arise and when mindfulness arises"},{"startMs":3680220,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"the breath comes to you by itself you"},{"startMs":3683220,"durationMs":2579,"subtitle":"should never seek the breath there
