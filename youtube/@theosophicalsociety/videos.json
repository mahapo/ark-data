Theosophy does not offer any dogma. Instead, it teaches us that the only authority on any matter is the inner wisdom attained by every person on the path of self-realization. One of its central tenets is that all spiritual inquiries are continuously open for further exploration.\n\nThis approach is both an opportunity and a challenge. It implies that we are responsible for our own limited or expansive understanding, and that our own inner unfoldment determines the quality and accuracy of our findings.   \n\nMany have provided a very needed light on the subject of what Theosophy is, contributing greatly to the intellectual and sometimes experiential realization of this “living truth.” This talk addresses some of the many facets of Theosophy through time and its immense practical value for the world.\n~~~\nJuliana Cesano is a third-generation Theosophist and has been actively involved with the Theosophical Society’s work for over 20 years. She became a staff member at the National Center of the Theosophical Society in America in 2007, where she currently serves as National Secretary and Member Education Director. She is an international speaker, and her main focus over the past 15 years has been the transformational power of contemplative practices.\n\n#theosophy #ancientwisdom #theosophicalsociety \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THtpI1IPX2o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THtpI1IPX2o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THtpI1IPX2o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THtpI1IPX2o/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THtpI1IPX2o/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":1,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"THtpI1IPX2o"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EMMWoPxTl7ghJwwD579k1ae6NqA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLk9FV291UTBSdnJF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-11T00:22:24Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Definition of “Truth” According to the Buddhist Scriptures","description":"Clipped from \"Buddhist Meditation Workshop: Allowing for Intuition, Revelation, and Insight\" with Ajahn Vajiro.

In 2018, over 100 years later, the International Theosophical Society adopted a new mission statement that strikingly and concisely put forward a number of elements Annie Besant spoke about in her lecture. This mission statement expresses exactly what the TS is all about since its foundation, and what it still wishes to contribute to the world of today: “To serve humanity by cultivating an ever-deepening understanding and realization of the Ageless Wisdom, spiritual self-transformation, and the unity of all life.” Each one of the elements can be used for profound meditation and offers spiritual anchors in today’s turbulent world for individuals, families, and communities alike. Indeed, in the current circumstances, those in favor of a peaceful and harmonious world for all are happy to receive support and guidance from the Ageless Wisdom, which has always existed, which still exists, and which will exist forever. With Annie Besant’s framework of Higher Life as the backdrop, Sabine Van Osta explores avenues of service hidden in this mission and how to become inspired by treading the path that is so well described in several theosophical classics and wisdom scriptures from both East and West. \n~~~~~\nSabine Van Osta has been an active member of the TS since 2001. She served as a board member of the Belgian Section from 2004 to 2008, and then served as secretary. In 2013, she became the president of the Belgium Section. In 2022, Sabine was elected Chair of the European Federation of Theosophical Societies (EFTS). Sabine gives lectures and leads study groups on core theosophical themes in Dutch, French, and English, and translates texts on theosophical and religious themes. In daily life, she works as a corporate paralegal in charge of board and shareholder matters. She lives in Antwerp, Belgium with her husband.\n\n#theosophy #besant #theosophicalsociety \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4EAoih86Pjk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4EAoih86Pjk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4EAoih86Pjk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4EAoih86Pjk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4EAoih86Pjk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":4,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4EAoih86Pjk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"uGxK2L0tWYNc1KvYTxCf40rGMWo","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlp1WDI0QVhDNmx3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-04T00:00:12Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Four Great Enunciations in the Upanishads","description":"Clipped from \"The Heart of the Spiritual Search in India: From the Rig Veda to the Yoga Sutras\" with Ravi Ravindra.

Sterner","description":"We all know that activities such as painting, learning music, or gaining proficiency in any sport require skills that must be developed. But moving through a challenging time such as losing a job, dealing with a difficult colleague at work or getting healthy also require skills. All of these endeavors require us to choose an overall goal and to learn to use that goal as a rudder to steer our efforts. The secret is in learning that the process of achieving our goals is not something we must endure, but instead is where the REAL joy waits to be discovered. The Practicing Mind is a means to unlearn the mindset that tells us that we are incomplete and that happiness is someplace outside of ourselves, someplace other than in the process of what we are doing right here and right now. It gives us the tools need to accomplish any task we choose, and to conquer the challenges we face in life while feeling patient with ourselves and incredibly self-empowered.\n\nThomas M. Sterner is the founder and CEO of The Practicing Mind Institute. An in-demand speaker, he works with high performance individuals including, athletes, industry groups, and individuals, helping them to operate effectively within high stress situations so they can break through to new levels of mastery. Top media outlets such as NPR, Fox News, and Forbes have sought his advice. He is the author of the bestseller The Practicing Mind: Developing Focus and Discipline in Your Life. Prior to founding The Practicing Mind Institute, Thomas served as the Chief Concert Piano technician for a major performing arts center. An accomplished musician and composer, he has also worked in the visual arts and as a recording studio engineer.

While we can appreciate and learn from centuries of religious institutions that began with great vision, we must also recognize what have become hollow remnants of a former spiritual vitality. \n\nIn the face of the secularism of a world in which science and fundamentalist belief are two polar opposites forever in a struggle, we must return to a more poetic basis for spiritual and religious expression. This is the solution to the religious and spiritual conflict that is rooted in emotional attachments and angry struggles of belief. Once we free our attachments to the labels of our beliefs, we can begin to heal from the secularism that is becoming a guiding principle for a society that has lost its sense of the sacred.\n-------------------\nThomas Moore is the author of The Eloquence of Silence and 24 other books about bringing soul to our personal lives and culture, including the #1 New York Times bestseller Care of the Soul.

The Buddha did not lay down dogma to be taken on faith. Rather, he offered a set of guidelines and practices by which a sincere seeker can prove the veracity of what he claimed. In this lecture, we will refer to some of the texts in the Buddhist Canon to see what the Buddha said about the “Dharma or Truth,” the ultimate human potential, and the challenge for us to realize it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nJohn Cianciosi was ordained a Buddhist monk in Thailand in 1972 and trained under one of that country’s most gifted and influential meditation masters, the late Venerable Ajahn Chah. Later, he was appointed abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat, the International Forest Monastery established to provide training for the growing number of Ajahn Chah’s Western disciples. In 1982, he was asked to establish a Buddhist monastery in Perth, Western Australia. For the next 14 years, he was instrumental in successfully establishing Bodhinyana Monastery and Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre. In 1995 he left monastic life and moved to the Chicago, Illinois area, where he continues to share his insights and wisdom. He is the author of The Meditative Path and is currently the director of public programs at the Theosophical Society in America.\n\n#buddha #dharma #dhamma\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E9r0crLk6V4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E9r0crLk6V4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E9r0crLk6V4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E9r0crLk6V4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E9r0crLk6V4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":14,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"E9r0crLk6V4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"SPeliyQbrUSFzUrBcKtWwQU4-QQ","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnM1M25vVVhvbkZ3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-09-07T01:42:48Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Unlocking Your Practice: Body Relaxation, Exhale Lengthening, and Love","description":"Clipped from \"Why You Should Care about Mantra\" with Scott Schwenk.

As its victims or its perpetrators, the feeling of hurt is very deep and pervasive. Words and gestures can hurt, as do certain actions and neglects. Injustice and unfairness—real or perceived —can hurt, as do unfulfilled expectations and betrayals. Hurt can be personal, but it almost always extends to everything that may define our identity: our family, country, gender, race, and religion.In Yoga of Forgiveness, we explore ways and means of coping with hurt in all its hues and colors so we can learn to live in harmony, without the burdens of guilt, victimhood, indifference and denial.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDr. Sehdev Kumar is Professor Emeritus of Environmental Studies at the University of Waterloo, Canada, specializing in and lecturing on bioethics, the history of cultures and civilizations, environmental ethics, and science-religion dialogue.

It has given rise to and sustained multiple world religions, and has also inspired thinkers from across the globe, ranging from ancient Greek philosophers to contemporary thinkers in such diverse fields as psychology, political science, theology, and even business management. In this presentation, Dr. Jeffery Long explores the many perspectives which make up Indian philosophy.\n\nVarious Hindu systems of thought are examined, including the worldviews expressed in the Vedic and Upanishadic literature, as well as in the famous “six systems” of classical Indian philosophy. The distinctive and major contributions of the relatively little-known Jain tradition are also explored, as well as Buddhist modes of thought, which are widely associated in the Western world with East and Southeast Asia, but which originated in the context of the Indian philosophical conversation.\n\nOther less known systems like those of the Lokayata materialists and the extinct Ajivika system are also covered. Questions examined include the nature of knowledge, the relationship of metaphysics and ethics, and the question of the nature, the existence, and even the necessity of God, as well as the importance of Indian philosophy for urgent contemporary global issues.\n\n--------------------\nJeffery D. Long is Professor of Religion and Asian Studies at Elizabethtown College, in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

Yet, we’re born with unlimited potential to grow, adapt, and succeed, making us innately powerful. The solution to empowerment is to access and harness our innate power. For this, we need to update our protective belief system and re-align with our essence, so that our subconscious no longer merely reacts to people and circumstances in self-defense. We need to get out of the habitual survival mode, and learn to know, appreciate, and eventually love what is authentically us and ours. We can then create a joyful and meaning-filled life by choosing freedom over safety, integrity over invisibility, and purpose over comfort. By realizing our own human potential, we can be of true benefit to the world.\n~~~~\nDr. Friedemann Schaub, a physician with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, left his career in allopathic medicine to pursue his passion and purpose of helping people overcome fear and anxiety without medication. For more than twenty years, he has helped thousands of his clients worldwide break through their mental and emotional blocks and become the empowered leaders of their lives. Dr. Friedemann is the author of the award-winning book The Fear and Anxiety Solution. His newest best-selling book, The Empowerment Solution, focuses on activating the healing power of the subconscious mind to switch out of stress- and anxiety-driven survival mode and make authenticity and confidence the everyday way of being.\n\nBuy The Fear and Anxiety Solution: https://amzn.to/43uYsTz\n\n#Consciousness #anxiety #mentalhealth \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/piUV3-CQLDA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/piUV3-CQLDA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/piUV3-CQLDA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/piUV3-CQLDA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/piUV3-CQLDA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":25,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"piUV3-CQLDA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"F6HZ6NCrW9fV4LaI3tNIbwBbH-8","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjJhVFZ2R1lFVDc4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-13T05:00:01Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Interpretations of the Life and Teachings of Our Lord Jesus Christ | Theosophical Classic 1977","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nGeoffrey Hodson explores the value of an esoteric interpretation of Christ and his teachings. 1977.\n\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2aTVvGYET78/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2aTVvGYET78/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2aTVvGYET78/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2aTVvGYET78/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2aTVvGYET78/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":26,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"2aTVvGYET78"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HEYkF46mbqaWzsgnEYHfrvz6WCs","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLl9tZ1d6a1JCMFow","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-11T00:00:07Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Crystal Energy—Revealed | Nicholas Pearson","description":"Join author and crystal expert Nicholas Pearson to explore how crystal energy works and how to harness it.

Carl Sagan's poetic assertion that we are made of \"\"star stuff\"\" serves as an inspiration, highlighting our cosmic heritage and interconnectedness with the universe.\n\nAccording to Ferrie, by appreciating the power of information and the role of replicators in preserving complexity, we uncover life's ultimate purpose: to perpetuate information and challenge the relentless march of decay. As unique manifestations of cosmic complexity, we have the choice and responsibility to shape the future through our actions, embracing our cosmic legacy and contributing to the grand tapestry of time.\n\n~~~\nChris Ferrie, Ph.D. is a Canadian physicist, mathematician, researcher, and children's book author. Ferrie studied at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, where he earned a BS.c. in mathematical physics, a Masters in applied mathematics, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics on Theory and Applications of Probability in Quantum Mechanics from the Institute for Quantum Computing and University of Waterloo. From 2013 to 2014 he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Quantum Information and Control of the University of New Mexico.

A tree, on one level, is just a tree, and it can be dissected and explained in biological terms. Yet when looked at from the perspective of a larger reality, a tree is a complete mystery. The same is true of everything, including us, we humans here on Earth. Birth, life, death, blood, hearts and hands, stone and sky, consciousness — all are sacred mysteries to behold with wonder and awe. Finding clarity means seeing the world from both perspectives: the ordinary and the mysterious. Yet finding clarity is only the first step. We also need to work cooperatively to take effective action and solve the crucial problems facing us. How? Practice!\n\nDuring this talk we explore seven core practices for integrating clarity within our lives:\n   1.Be Curious Not Furious\n   2.Drop The Story\n   3. Listen For Understanding\n   4. Mind The Gaps\n   5. Cultivate A Clear Vision\n   6. Turn Breakdowns Into Breakthroughs\n   7. Don't Wait\n\n~~~\nMarc Lesser is a CEO, executive coach, and Zen teacher. He founded and was CEO of three companies and has an MBA from New York University. Finding Clarity is his fifth book. His other books include Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader: Lessons from Google and a Zen Monastery Kitchen and Less: Accomplishing More By Doing Less. Marc helped develop the world-renowned Search Inside Yourself program within Google—a mindfulness-based emotional intelligence training for leaders that spread through Silicon Valley and then globally. He was also a resident of the San Francisco Zen Center for 10 years, and director of Tassajara, Zen Mountain Center, the first Zen monastery in the western world.

Conversely, what we think of as “evil” is actually related to a sense of separation, resulting in a lack of empathy and a desire for power.\n\nPsychologist and spiritual teacher Steve Taylor, Ph.D., suggests that connection is fundamental to human beings. Our sense of separation is superficial and aberrational. As Steve’s philosophy of panspiritism  suggests,  human consciousness is a manifestation of a more fundamental universal consciousness. When we experience our interconnection, we feel empathy and compassion, which leads to altruism. The main goal of spiritual practices and paths is to transcend separateness and attune to our fundamental oneness. In this way, spiritual development is intimately linked to altruism and social justice. Steve will include meditations and poems to illustrate the reality and the power of connection.\n\n~~~\nSteve Taylor, Ph.D., is a senior lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University. His books include Waking From Sleep, The Fall, Out of the Darkness, The Calm Center, The Leap, Spiritual Science, and Extraordinary Awakenings: When Trauma Leads to Transformation.

D.","description":"In every tradition, saints and poets speak of the soul’s search for the beloved, the seeker’s yearning for the divine, for the Self beyond ego. This holy longing leads us to pursue a higher union in spiritual practice, religious discipleship, even romantic embrace. But it also can go awry when we project the divine onto a teacher, priest, guru, rabbi, or roshi who is all too human— and who has a shadow. If a leader abuses power—sexual, financial, or emotional coercion—we feel betrayed and disillusioned, our faith destroyed. This lecture offers the tools of depth psychology and spiritual shadow-work to help us recover and rekindle the light of spiritual inspiration and renew your connection to something larger than ego. This program is based on Professor's Zweig's new book, \"Meeting the Shadow on the Spiritual Path: The Dance of Darkness and Light in Our Search for Awakening.\"\n~~~~~~~\nConnie Zweig, Ph.D., is a retired therapist and coauthor of Meeting the Shadow and Romancing the Shadow. She also published a novel, A Moth to the Flame: The Life of Sufi Poet Rumi. Her new bestselling book, The Inner Work of Age: Shifting from Role to Soul, extends her work on the Shadow into midlife and beyond and explores aging as a spiritual practice. It won the 2022 Gold COVR Award, the 2022 Gold Nautilus Award, the 2021 American Book Fest Award, and the 2021 Best Indie Book Award for best inspirational non-fiction. Connie has been doing contemplative practices for more than 50 years. She is a wife, stepmother, and grandmother. After all these roles, she’s practicing the shift from role to soul. Her updated, expanded edition of Meeting the Shadow on the Spiritual Path: The Dance of Darkness and Light in Our Search for Awakening will be released in May, 2023.\n\n#shadowwork #spirituality #conniezweig","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pucANgptabM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pucANgptabM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pucANgptabM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pucANgptabM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pucANgptabM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":49,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pucANgptabM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"G_dc8TVSYcOdEhqaWRklbefCehw","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlNnYVhrd1RiYVVB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-28T04:00:11Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"HPB's Diagram of Meditation with John Algeo | Theosophical Classic 1992","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nWhat did H. P. Blavatsky (HPB) know about meditation and how did she teach it to her personal students? We may never know the full answer to these questions, but she did leave behind a curious diagram outlining her approach to meditation, which is the subject of this talk. In 1887, the year before the publication of The Secret Doctrine, Madame Blavatsky held classes on meditation with her personal students, which included such luminaries as Annie Besant, Bertram Keightley, and G. R. S. Mead. These classes took place over a period of several months, beginning in late 1887 and ending sometime in early 1888. There are no surviving notes or minutes from these meetings, but we do have what is known as HPB’s Diagram of Meditation. \n\nIn this talk, John Algeo explores the diagram, offering his interpretation as to its meaning, while pointing out similarities between it and the primary ideas found in The Secret Doctrine. Presented in 1992.\n\nAvailable on DVD at https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1134&search=HPB%27s&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true&page=2\n\nSign up today for free spiritual resources, new programs, and more! https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/j6HRSIr/social\n\n#Theosophy\n#meditation\n#spiritualawakening\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgaXkwTbaUA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgaXkwTbaUA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgaXkwTbaUA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgaXkwTbaUA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgaXkwTbaUA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":50,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SgaXkwTbaUA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"TkD2UUjHHw7i834uWDPohgiZdts","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnhJSm1iU25KSHA0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-26T05:00:21Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Secret Doctrine: Cosmogenesis Series III, Pt.3 with Pablo Sender | At Home with Theosophy Series","description":"View the entire series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtuDWE10sVdJIOzbkkmTfYHIYuzce8ML\n\nPresented on 6/6/2017.\n\nPart Three | The Parents of Man on Earth - 3\n\nThe Secret Doctrine was H.

It is an ancient spiritual technique (used in Buddhist dream yoga, Taoism, Sufism, and numerous native wisdom traditions). However, the scientific evidence for lucid dreaming emerged in 1980, which makes lucid dreaming a fascinating subject, since this ancient spiritual technique has achieved scientific acceptance and investigation.\n\nIn this lecture, Robert Waggoner examines the experiments which provided evidence for lucid dreaming, along with the more ancient view of lucid dreaming as a pathway to accelerated spiritual growth. He also examines the use of lucid dreaming by modern day psychotherapists to resolve recurring nightmares in people with PTSD, along with lucid dreaming's potential use in areas such as accessing inner creativity, exploring the unconscious, and spiritual practice.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn 1975, Robert Waggoner taught himself a simple technique to lucid dream or become consciously aware of dreaming, while in the dream state. Since that time, he has logged more than 1,000 lucid dreams and written two books: the acclaimed Lucid Dreaming - Gateway to the Inner Self, (now in its 15th printing) and the award winning, Lucid Dreaming Plain and Simple (with co-author Caroline McCready). Robert's books have been translated into eight languages and he has traveled the world giving lectures at universities and conferences and weekend workshops in this exciting area. A past president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams, he also co-edits the online magazine, Lucid Dreaming Experience.\n\nBuy Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self: https://amzn.to/3MUEls8 \n\n#luiddreams #dreamwork #luciddreaming \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD4LvZyHuOo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD4LvZyHuOo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD4LvZyHuOo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD4LvZyHuOo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kD4LvZyHuOo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":52,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"kD4LvZyHuOo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"sb6mjs-JkBcNJJvgZZRXVZ_EXGo","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjhDV1hNMDBwb1BJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-22T15:01:21Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"35 New Trees Planted at the Olcott Arboretum","description":"In honor of Arbor Day, staff and volunteers planted 35 new trees and spent the day beautifying our 42-acre campus.

Celebrated on the full moon in May, it was on the Day of Vesak over two and a half millennia ago that the Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nWhile the Buddha’s teachings continue to inspire people around the world, there are divergent views about the teachings, including how they should be interpreted and how they apply to today’s modern society. In this conversation with Ajahn Brahmāli, Quest magazine editor Richard Smoley discuss these views and explore some core topics such as secular Buddhism, the idea of rebirth and reincarnation, the nature of karma, meditation, and enlightenment.\n\n---------\nAjahn Brahmāli was born in Norway in 1964. He first became interested in Buddhism and meditation in his early 20s while on a visit to Japan. After hearing teachings from Ajahn Brahm, he decided to travel to Australia to train at Bodhinyana Monastery, where he took full ordination as a Buddhist monk in 1996. Ajahn Brahmāli is renowned for his excellent knowledge of the Pali language and his enthusiasm for teaching the suttas. He is also well known as a scholar of the Vinaya—the monastic rules and procedures—which he is currently translating into English. Ajahn Brahmāli’s clear and insightful talks help make the Buddha’s teachings accessible to all. He is regularly invited to conduct retreats in Australia, South-East Asia, Sri Lanka, and Europe.\n\n#vesak #enlightenment #reincarnation \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Vp3iBy53iI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Vp3iBy53iI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Vp3iBy53iI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Vp3iBy53iI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Vp3iBy53iI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":56,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_Vp3iBy53iI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4g1_uuU_rr_aZtZzADMAKs6CmM4","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnMxaUpZNVB2SkdB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-14T04:00:23Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Freedom: Social Alchemy for the Year 2000 - Part 1 with Stephan Hoeller | Theosophical Classic 1992","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nBased on Professor Hoeller’s book Freedom: Alchemy for a Voluntary Society, this provocative presentation looks at the archetypal spiritual foundations of the American Republic, especially from the points of view of the ancient Hermetic tradition, the Gnostics, and depth-psychologist Carl Jung. 1 of 2.

Fortunately, renowned tarot teacher Barbara Moore is happy to introduce you to this mystical divination tool. Tarot provides just enough structure so that we don't get lost as we explore the mysteries of life, plumb our dusty corners, and find our way even in the dark. After a quick peek at how tarot began, we will trace its evolution to the present. We will meet the cards and talk about readings. The presentation concludes with a survey of different explanations about how tarot works.\n\nBarbara Moore has taught tarot all over the world. At a party nearly 30 years ago, someone put a tarot deck in Barbara's hands and she’s held on tight ever since. Barbara considers tarot as her sacred text, one that is flexible enough to evolve as her understanding of the world changes. She has published several books, mostly on tarot, including Your Tarot Your Way, Tarot for Beginners, Tarot Spreads, The Steampunk Tarot, Tarot in Wonderland, Modern Guide to Energy Clearing, and many others. She has taught tarot all over the world, including helping found a tarot school in Chengdu, China in 2017.

According to Theosophy, the principle of mind (manas in Sanskrit) is that crucial ingredient that makes us human. The scope and range of the human mind covers the objective and subjective worlds, the near and the far, the concrete and the abstract. Using the basic model of a computer, which consists of input, processing, and output, the speaker suggests that the human mind can be described analogously as consisting of feeling, thought, and will. In other words, the mind can best be understood as a process rather than a thing.

However, it can also produce thoughts that lead to suffering. For many people, thoughts run rampant and seem to oppress or control their lives. In two well-known discourses, the Buddha reflected on the nature of thinking, its benefits, dangers, and limitations. These discourses provide insightful and pragmatic instructions for working with the thinking mind so that it becomes a helpful friend rather than a source of oppression. In this lecture, we will explore these teachings given by the Buddha and see how we can use them to help us live happier, healthier lives.\n\nJohn Cianciosi was ordained a Buddhist monk in Thailand in 1972 and trained under one of that country’s most gifted and influential meditation masters, the late Venerable Ajahn Chah. Later, he was appointed abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat, the International Forest Monastery established to provide training for the growing number of Ajahn Chah’s Western disciples. In 1982, he was asked to establish a Buddhist monastery in Perth, Western Australia. For the next 14 years, he was instrumental in successfully establishing Bodhinyana Monastery and Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre. In 1995 he left the monastic life and moved to the Chicago, Illinois area, where he continues to share his insights and wisdom. He is the author of The Meditative Path and is currently the director of public programs at the Theosophical Society in America.\n\n#buddhism #buddha #meditation \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xW8nST05OE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xW8nST05OE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xW8nST05OE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xW8nST05OE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xW8nST05OE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":74,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"3xW8nST05OE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"-n29ViVkW6A5RQHsbHbCDVFcgY8","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjF4cFZDRzZfNGhR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-04-09T04:00:00Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Meaning of Tibetan Buddhist Chanting with Thubten Pende  | Theosophical Classic 1987","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nAn American Buddhist monk reveals the meaning behind Buddhist chants.

These practices not only aid in wellness on the physical level; they also act as gateways to higher consciousness. In yoga, true freedom happens in the place of stillness. In the classical yoga philosophy, what is Real is present everywhere, but we cannot always see this because we are not conscious of our true nature. The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali is a collection of Sanskrit sutras (aphorisms) on the theory and practice of yoga. This lecture focuses on this 2000-year-old compilation and how it forms the basis for achieving higher consciousness.\n\nJudith Sugg, Ph.D. is a teacher and counselor intrigued with the power and clarity of the ancient texts and the light they bring to our present moment. She has written on mindfulness and conflict resolution, the overlap of psychology and yoga, and has recently finished a study guide on the Yoga Sutras.

The first woman with such a presence in a male-dominated field, she paved the way for women as no one else before, and attracted other women who helped spread Theosophical ideas. Join us to find out more about two such women: Mary Gebhard and Clara Codd. The first Theosophical Lodge in Germany, the Germania Theosophical Society, was formed and met in Mary Gebhard’s house, and H. P. Blavatsky stayed with her on two occasions. She received a few letters from the Masters and saw the astral form of Master Morya. Clara Codd was an English Theosophist known for her work as a feminist, lecturer, teacher, and writer. She served as General Secretary of both the Australian and South African sections and during a Theosophical career of nearly 70 years, she traveled to five continents.\n\nSusanne Hoepfl-Wellenhofer was born in Austria and has been living and working in the U.S. since 1986. Even before finding Theosophy in 2010, she had been following her own spiritual path, comparing religion, science, philosophy, and psychology for over 20 years. She is currently the president of the Washington, D.C. Lodge and recently created a course for the Online School of Theosophy. She has a law degree from the University of Graz and a master’s degree in educational technology from George Washington University, where she worked for 20 years before retiring in 2019. She continues to translate German to English, including texts from Theosophist Dr. Franz Hartmann, and she is also a yoga instructor.

He will discuss how consciousness may derive from material reality, and how material reality may derive from consciousness. Concepts of \"\"universal\"\" or \"\"pure\"\" consciousness versus “local” or “ego” consciousness will also be explored. The issue of whether artificial intelligence can possess consciousness will be examined as an extension of the relationship between consciousness and the brain or material reality.\n\nAndrew B. Newberg, M.D. is currently the research director at the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University and Hospital in Philadelphia. He is a professor in the Department of Integrative Medicine and Nutritional Sciences, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Radiology at Thomas Jefferson University. Dr. Newberg has been particularly involved in the study of mystical and religious experiences, a field referred to as “neurotheology.”  He has published over 250 peer reviewed articles and chapters on brain function, brain imaging, and the study of religious and mystical experiences. He has published 12 books which have been translated into 17 different languages including the best sellers, Why God Won’t Go Away and How God Changes Your Brain. He has recently co-authored The Varieties of Spiritual Experience. Andrew was listed as one of the 30 Most Influential Neuroscientists Alive Today by the Online Psychology Degree Guide.\n\nThis program was made possible thanks to the generous support of Ken and Barb LaSorella.

To achieve this, we must pursue a “compassion revolution” by caring for those we may not know or like and preventing “mobbery” (the accumulation of personal anger into powerful group anger).\n\nAyo's offering is anchored in her own human story and rooted in her interpretations of Buddhist tradition and astute analysis of our present politics. She weaves an authentic invitation to all of us to draw on her reflection and teaching to be our most fully present and compassionate selves, in kinship with all beings.\n\nPamela Ayo Yetunde, J.D., M.A., Th.D. is a pastoral counselor, professor, and writer. She wrote Casting Indra's Net: Fostering Spiritual Kinship and Community, and co-edited Nautilus Book Award-winning Black and Buddhist: What Buddhism Can Teach Us about Race, Resilience, Transformation, and Freedom with Cheryl A. Giles. Yetunde is also the author of the Frederick J.Streng Award-winning Buddhist-Christian Dialogue, U.S. Law, and Womanist Theology for Transgender Spiritual Care and Object Relations, Buddhism, and Relationality in Womanist Practical Theology.  In response to the torture and killing of George Floyd, Ayo became the principal founder of Buddhist Justice Reporter (www.buddhistjustice.com) and was recognized in 2022 by the International Women’s Meditation Center Foundation as one of the Outstanding Women in Buddhism.

Ellen Meredith’s answer to this question is to teach us how to use the language our bodies speak—energy—to tap into the conversations taking place just under the surface of your awareness. Your body, mind, and spirit are constantly communicating with each other and by learning to “speak energy.” You can participate more consciously in those exchanges and profoundly influence individual and collective health and well-being. In a lively style that invites play, exploration, and tapping into your own experiential wisdom, Ellen brings to light how your body can show you the way to navigate change.\n\nEllen Meredith, Doctor of Arts, is a conscious channel, medical intuitive, energy medicine practitioner, teacher, and author. She has been in practice since 1984, helping over ten thousand clients and students across the globe tune into and communicate with their own energies, hear their inner guidance, and heal. Ellen is renowned for her down-to-earth, yet out-of-the box thinking. Originally trained as a healer by her inner teachers, Ellen later became an Eden Energy Medicine Advanced Practitioner (EEMAP), served on Donna Eden’s faculty, and is presently on the faculty of Shift Network. She is the author of several books, including Your Body Will Show You the Way: Energy Medicine for Personal and Global Change and The Language Your Body Speaks: Self-healing with Energy Medicine.\n\nBuy Ellen’s book: https://amzn.to/3Ip8Ioy \n\n#energyhealing #energymedicine #healing\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y0-KLJxyxbg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y0-KLJxyxbg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y0-KLJxyxbg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y0-KLJxyxbg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y0-KLJxyxbg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":105,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"y0-KLJxyxbg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"5etcaBa_GBa0NQNbmyz-KX8mI1E","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnBGR0NQWE9SbWJZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-07T20:39:25Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Does Secular Buddhism Exist? | Ajahn Brahmāli","description":"Spiritual and secular values are often regarded as opposed to each other. In this talk, Ajahn Brahmāli discusses whether this is really the case. If undogmatic spiritual practice is simply a search for truth, then spirituality is not only compatible with secular values, but complementary to them. Ajahn Brahmāli discusses certain accepted spiritual truths, such as karma and rebirth, and how to make sense of them from a secular perspective. He then shows how Buddhism as proclaimed by the Buddha, and indeed all sincere spiritual practice, is in fact secular in nature.\n\nAjahn Brahmāli was born in Norway in 1964. He first became interested in Buddhism and meditation in his early 20s while on a visit to Japan. After hearing teachings from Ajahn Brahm, he decided to travel to Australia to train at Bodhinyana Monastery, where he took full ordination as a Buddhist monk in 1996. Ajahn Brahmāli is renowned for his excellent knowledge of the Pali language and his enthusiasm for teaching the suttas. He is also well known as a scholar of the Vinaya—the monastic rules and procedures—which he is currently translating into English.  Ajahn Brahmāli’s clear and insightful talks help make the Buddha’s teachings accessible to all. He is regularly invited to conduct retreats in Australia, South-East Asia, Sri Lanka, and Europe. He has also published numerous essays on important points of Dhamma, including the legitimacy of bhikkhuni ordination, of which he is a supporter.\n\n#buddhistmonk #dharmatalk #buddhism\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFGCPXORmbY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFGCPXORmbY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFGCPXORmbY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFGCPXORmbY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFGCPXORmbY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":106,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pFGCPXORmbY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"QMrI8mRWXmsCwO4FL3V1fM1nYXo","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjNaVG1GQTY0RFFv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-02-05T06:00:02Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Creative Meditation: Balancing Inner and Outer Action with Maria Parisen | Theosophical Classic 2013","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nIn a universe alive with meaning and purpose, every action is creative.

Even under “normal” circumstances, the complexity of life provides any number of obstacles, from family issues to work difficulties to concern about the state of the world. And for those struggling with some degree of depression or anxiety, the difficulties can increase. Mental health is a huge issue, and it needs to be addressed from a variety of different avenues. During this lecture, Barbara Hebert, Ph.D., discusses mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety from a spiritual perspective in an attempt to help us understand how we can improve our own mental health.\n\nBarbara B. Hebert, Ph.D., currently serves as president of the Theosophical Society in America. A third-generation Theosophist, Barbara has been involved in local, regional, and national offices throughout her years of membership. In addition to her years of service with the Theosophical Society, she has been a mental health practitioner and educator for many years.\n\nThis program was made possible thanks to the generous support of Zhanna Aidarkhanova.

However, the Buddha was very careful to refute the notion of fatalism and the belief in a soul that transmigrates from life to life. He pointed to a process of conditioned becoming, governed by impersonal natural laws, which doesn't require a creator or a soul. Within this framework, we discover both the freedom and the responsibility of shaping destiny.

The Genie in Your Genes was the first book to demonstrate that emotions drive gene expression. Mind to Matter showed that the brain creates much of what we think of as “objective reality.” Bliss Brain demonstrates that peak mental states rapidly remodel the brain for happiness. In this interview, author and Quest magazine editor Richard Smoley will speak with Dr. Church about some of his findings. Together, they will explore evidence-based medicine, how emotions affect the body and the genes, the role of the brain in constructing our perceptions of reality, and EFT “tapping,” a simple method for overcoming psychological stresses and disorders.\n\nBuy Bliss Brain: https://amzn.to/3SfBHMP \nBuy The Genie in Your Genes: https://amzn.to/3eJRfdS \n\nDawson Church, Ph.D., did his undergraduate and graduate work at Baylor University, and obtained his doctorate at Holos University under the supervision of Harvard-trained neurosurgeon Norm Shealey, M.D., Ph.D., founder of the American Holistic Medical Association. Dr. Church has conducted dozens of clinical trials and founded the National Institute for Integrative Healthcare to study and implement promising evidence-based psychological and medical techniques. Its largest program, the Veterans Stress Project, has offered free treatment to over 20,000 veterans with PTSD over the past decade. His groundbreaking research has been published in many prestigious scientific journals. Dawson Church is the editor of Energy Psychology: Theory, Research, & Treatment, a peer-reviewed professional journal.

Join astrologer Rachel Lang for an in-depth talk about the astrology of 2023. When outer planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto change signs, they signify societal shifts and periods of cultural evolution. Transformative Pluto begins its long journey into Aquarius, suggesting a move toward collectivism and an emphasis on communities. Saturn, the planet of rules, moves into mystical Pisces, suggesting we are drawing from a foundation of faith as we make commitments and create order in our lives. With the lunar nodes activating the Aries/Libra axis line and Venus going retrograde in the summer, we will test out these transitions in our personal relationships. How can you meet these changes with grace? Find out what these shifts could mean for you.\n\nRachel Lang is a professional astrologer, psychic medium, and author of Modern Day Magic: 8 Simple Rules to Realize Your Power and Shape Your Life. As a writer, her monthly horoscope columns appear in the Omega News, Club Magic Hour, and Conscious Living. She contributes to publications like Well+Good and Women’s Health.

Such abilities embrace a vast range of phenomena, without the need for us to necessarily have a deepening understanding of the noumena upon which they are based. This presentation will attempt to provide a theosophical view and framework, whereby an understanding of these laws, phenomena, and noumena can be seen as being an inherent aspect of our immortal and Divine SELF.

Dr. Normandi Ellis","description":"The true name of what we call The Egyptian Book of the Dead was known to the Egyptians as The Book of Coming into Light. The scribes who created the hundreds of books of the afterlife chapter by chapter, who inscribed the coffins and tomb walls, who worked the inscriptions of golden shrine boxes, considered themselves the most blessed of Egyptians. Their knowledge of the Book of the Dead gave them insight into how to live their lives as beings of light, of choice, of illuminated consciousness. \"\"The scribe who knows these inscriptions is a thousand times blessed,\"\" they used to say.\n\nIn this lecture, Normandi Ellis looks at the creation of various afterlife texts, including The Pyramid Texts, The Book of Two Ways, the Appeasing of Sekhmet and the all-important chapters of the Negative Confession, The Hours of the Night, and Knowing the Shadows of Ra.\n\nRev. Dr. Normandi Ellis is an arch-priestess of the Temple of Isis and has led sacred trips to Egypt since 1992. Awakening Osiris, her original translations of the hieroglyphs found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, is considered a spiritual classic. Her other books exploring ancient Egyptian metaphysics include Dreams of Isis, Feasts of Light, Imagining the World into Existence, Invoking the Scribes of Ancient Egypt and The Union of Isis and Thoth. Her essays have appeared in Watkins - Body Mind Spirit, Parabola, Gnosis, Magical Blend and The Rosicrucian Digest among other magazines. In 2020, Normandi completed her doctorate of divinity in comparative religions. She is a Spiritualist minister astrologer living in Chesterfield, Indiana.\n\n#bookofthedead #egyptian #ancientegypt \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8_2W0xqUr8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8_2W0xqUr8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8_2W0xqUr8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8_2W0xqUr8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8_2W0xqUr8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":133,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"J8_2W0xqUr8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"LOZtXYh94YrO-2NcJ0L8h7BeMWQ","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmZwUVFCQ09HbGRn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-27T23:00:17Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Theosophical Perspectives on Dealing with Pain with Dora Kunz | Theosophical Classic 1985","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nHow do Theosophical teachings help a person cope more effectively with physical or emotional pain?

Its message is essentially that of dharma, or right action, right thought, and right path. It is the dialogue between Arjuna, the paradigmatic warrior, and the God Krishna, a symbol of the soul.\n\nWhen a monumental confrontation is about to be unleashed, a most unusual and unique situation takes place: while tension builds up between two armies, Krishna in the middle of the battlefield, gives Arjuna the most sacred teachings. These teaching becomes the Bhagavad Gita, or “The Song of the Lord, Krishna.” Its core may perhaps be what the Yogasutras teach; that behind form, there is a Thinker who uses the form; and that the aspiring disciple should “step out of illusion, and be who he essentially is, the soul.”\n\nPresenter Eduardo Javier Gramaglia holds a degree in classical philology from National University. He gives seminars, workshops, and lectures on a wide range of Theosophical subjects. His main area of research is the late Hellenistic tradition, particularly its hermetic texts on mystery traditions and astrology. He published Hermetic Astrology in 2006, the first book in Spanish on the ancient astrological traditions. He has taken part in international conventions, given seminars, and published two English translations of Ancient Greek astrological manuals. Eduardo teaches Ancient Religion and Myth, as well as Sanskrit language and literature at National University. He is also the principal pianist and harpsichordist of the Municipal Chamber Orchestra in Cordoba, Argentina and teaches musical analysis and the history of music.\n\n#bhagavadgita #arjuna #krishna \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQh132dbNzw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQh132dbNzw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQh132dbNzw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQh132dbNzw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQh132dbNzw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":137,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KQh132dbNzw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"c9hcoOavYz4uAX_GKC-SUBhUmBA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnpfUFA0a2hoMWdF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-16T02:00:30Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"What Is Satcitananda?

Over time, Tibetan Buddhism developed a sophisticated scholastic philosophy and elaborate and unique forms of tantric practice.\n\nAs interest in Tibetan Buddhism in the West has grown, some of these teachings and practices have become known, but are not always understood or used correctly. In this conversation with Andrew Holecek, a well-known authority on Tibetan Buddhism, author and editor Richard Smoley explores essential themes, such as the benefit and peril of tantra, dream meditation, Bardo, the role of the Guru, and the challenge of integrating Tibetan Buddhism in our western culture.\n\nDr. Andrew Holecek is an author and spiritual teacher who offers seminars on meditation, lucid dreaming, and dream yoga in the United States and abroad. As a longtime student of Buddhism, he presents this tradition from a contemporary perspective, blending the ancient wisdom of the East with modern knowledge from the West. Known as an expert on lucid dreaming and the Tibetan yogas of sleep and dream, he is an experienced guide for students drawn to these powerful practices. Dr. Andrew Holecek’s works include Dream Yoga: Illuminating Your Life Through Lucid Dreaming and the Tibetan Yogas of Sleep; the audio learning course Dream Yoga: The Tibetan Path of Awakening Through Lucid Dreaming; Dreams of Light: The Profound Daytime Practice of Lucid Dreaming; and The Lucid Dreaming Workbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering Your Dream Life (See all of his books).

The Pali word “Mangala” means something auspicious, a blessing, a good or lucky sign, or an omen; and “sutta” means discourse. So, it has often been translated into English as the “Discourse on Blessings.” In this discourse, the Buddha endeavors to answer the age-old question posed by all: How can one achieve happiness? His advice is as relevant today as it was when he gave this teaching. The Buddha presented 38 conditions, blessings, or auspicious omens that are conducive to success and happiness in this life and future lives. These conditions, which are both ethical and spiritual in nature, will lead not only to success and happiness in life, but also constitute the essence of a spiritual life that culminates in the realization of enlightenment.\n\nJohn Cianciosi has ordained a Buddhist monk in Thailand in 1972 and trained under one of that country’s most gifted and influential meditation masters, the late Venerable Ajahn Chah. While living in remote jungle monasteries, he led a disciplined, celibate life devoted to the practice of mental cultivation. Later, he was appointed abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat, the International Forest Monastery established to provide training for the growing number of Ajahn Chah’s Western disciples. In 1982, he was asked to establish a Buddhist monastery in Perth, Western Australia. For the next 14 years, he was instrumental in successfully establishing Bodhinyana Monastery and Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre. In 1995 he left the monastic life and moved to the Chicago, Illinois area, where he continues to share his insights and wisdom. He is the author of The Meditative Path and is currently the director of public programs at the Theosophical Society in America.\n\nBuy The Meditative Path here: https://amzn.to/3U80tk2 \n\n#buddhism #buddha #enlightenment \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members, or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFmR64gcRlQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFmR64gcRlQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFmR64gcRlQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFmR64gcRlQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFmR64gcRlQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":149,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"fFmR64gcRlQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"niqbv47hlNrOA5HO4Iu4487BjbU","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlhhb0lDVTJrSFZF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-19T14:00:30Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"How to Meet a Ghost: Necessary Prep Work and How to Behave","description":"Clipped from “Clairvoyance: The Art of Seeing Clearly” with Kurt Leland.

In this talk, Dr. Ruben Laukkonen presents a bird’s-eye view of the path of meditation from the perspective of the predictive brain.\n\nA recently published theory authored by Ruben and Professor Heleen Slagter places three popular styles of meditation—focused attention, open monitoring, and non-dual meditation—on a single continuum, where each technique progressively releases increasingly ingrained habits of prediction, including the self, all by bringing the practitioner closer to the idealistic “Now\"\". This deconstruction can also permit certain insights to arise and may unveil states of so-called pure awareness.\n\nRuben also describes how some deep experiences (e.g., a total cessation of consciousness, or \"\"Nirodha\"\") might transform the predictions the organism makes in daily life, possibly explaining some of the persistent experiences reported by long-term practitioners. Finally, discusses how these ideas may touch upon an age-old paradox in a new light: How can an organism with a boundary exist in a non-dual way?\n\nRuben Laukkonen, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor at Southern Cross University in Australia and holds honorary fellowships at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and The University of Queensland. Ruben’s research aims to uncover empirically grounded and experientially authentic models of meditation, insight, and non-duality. Using a combination of methods including behavior, neuroimaging, machine learning, and phenomenology, he is investigating some of the rarest states of awareness available to human beings. Ruben’s research is deeply theoretically driven and traverses multiple levels of explanation, from neurons to psychology. He has published articles in leading journals, regularly speaks at international conferences, consults for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and has written on topics that range from artificial intelligence to psychedelics. Ruben has an eclectic contemplative background, including traditions such as Zen, Advaita, and Theravada.\n\n#nondual #meditation #scienceandspirituality \n \nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBzag-8USns/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBzag-8USns/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBzag-8USns/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBzag-8USns/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBzag-8USns/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":160,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vBzag-8USns"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"yc07oY_IiM9X4y-JkaZMGhH5X8w","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkVJbURhZ3pkbW1j","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-25T22:00:04Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Native Shamanism and Healing with Medicine Grizzlybear Lake | Theosophical Classic 1991","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nMedicine Grizzlybear gives examples of shamanistic healing techniques.

What does it mean to be a hero according to this tradition? What do the ancient sources tell us that might inform our developmental path? What can we glean about the process of becoming a god? \n\nWiccan High Priestess and religious studies scholar Gwendolyn Reece believes that we are being called upon to walk a heroic path in which we are striving for excellence and to be of benefit to more than just our near and dear. She is obviously not an enlightened being…but is deeply interested in figuring out how to become one and, in her tradition, believes that the Great Ones are clear that what They want is for us to grow and transcend our limitations, becoming like Them.\n\nGwendolyn Reece holds a Ph.D. in education and master’s degree in religious studies. She is the Associate University Librarian and Director of Research, Teaching, and Learning at American University. Gwendolyn has been a member of the Theosophical Society in America since 1999 and is a Wiccan High Priestess of the Assembly of the Sacred. She leads Theophania coven in Washington, D.C., and organizes the Sacred Space Conference, the largest annual esoteric conference on the east coast.\n\n#wiccan #archetype #hellenic\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P0vuDs6rIU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P0vuDs6rIU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P0vuDs6rIU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P0vuDs6rIU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P0vuDs6rIU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":162,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"8P0vuDs6rIU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"WL1nACVvVzOCSGzKAL12pjtYyYU","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlZSYmZKQVVEc2Nr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-18T21:00:07Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"A Priestess of Isis with Adam Warcup | Theosophical Classic 1991","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nA longtime teacher and lecturer for the Theosophical Society in England, Adam Warcup explores H.

Sri Ram’s words, as “Wisdom which springs from the depths of a certain nature in ourselves.” If we are honest, our day-to-day life is not flooded with Wisdom. Self-deception, selfishness, and attachment are some of the characteristics of a dormant heart, not ready for Truth. So, how can this human being that we are, this “God in exile,” arrive to the experience of being one with Nature and subject to all her laws, no different than a galaxy? How can this microcosm that you and I are know itself enough to know the power and beauty of the entire universe? In this talk, we will explore these questions from a theosophical perspective.\n\nJuliana Cesano is a third-generation Theosophist who has been actively involved in the Society’s work for over 20 years.

Converging with universal wisdom teachings and inter-spirituality, this emergent wholeworld-view recognizes a conscious Universe that meaningfully exists and purposefully evolves as a unified and sentient entity. Our planetary home, Gaia, has nurtured its universal evolutionary impulse to ever greater levels of individuated and interdependent complexity, diversity and self-awareness. Instead of the old secular paradigm of materialism and illusory separation, this unitive new narrative helps to explain the hitherto unexplained, invites us to heal our fragmented perception, and can serve to empower and help guide our conscious evolution.\n\nDr. Jude Currivan is a cosmologist, planetary healer, and author. She was previously one of the most senior business women in the UK, and co-founder of WholeWorld-View. She has experienced multidimensional realities since early childhood.

On Being an Occultist | Kurt Leland","description":"Nowadays, the word occult connotes the cultivation of hidden powers, possibly to the detriment of self and others. Yet, when the Theosophical Society was founded, occultism—the study of the occult—was a spiritual practice for developing our highest ideals. To be an occultist required working for the greater good rather than for self alone. This was ethical magic. Occultism, then, was the system of magical ethics that supported such a practice, showing us how to place ourselves in right relationship with our hidden powers and those of the universe. Perhaps it’s time to restore the high calling of being an occultist.\n\nKurt Leland is an international lecturer for the Theosophical Society. He has been teaching classes in psychic and spiritual development for twenty years. He is the author of several books, including Invisible Worlds: Annie Besant on Psychic and Spiritual DevelopmentInvisible Worlds: Annie Besant on Psychic and Spiritual Development, Rainbow Body: A History of the Western Chakra System from Blavatsky to Brennan, and The Multidimensional Human: Practices for Psychic Development and Astral Projection.\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5JkqlSF88VI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5JkqlSF88VI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5JkqlSF88VI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5JkqlSF88VI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5JkqlSF88VI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":171,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"5JkqlSF88VI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"p8_Xzn7XKThzOi_t506R8vjxNU0","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnFMXzlxbXc5LTc0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-16T19:27:01Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Awakening to our Human Healing Potential | Shamini Jain, Ph.D.","description":"Spontaneous remission, the placebo effect, and energy healing—these phenomena have baffled the medical community for decades.

Such abilities embrace a vast range of phenomena, without the need for us to necessarily have a deepening understanding of the noumena upon which they are based. This presentation will attempt to provide a theosophical view and framework, whereby an understanding of these laws, phenomena, and noumena can be seen as being an inherent aspect of our immortal and Divine SELF. Being inherent, they are accessible, in degrees, by the incarnating ego.\n\nEugene Jennings is a longtime student in the study of Theosophy.

Best known for his top-selling work The Sirius Mystery, he has written books on Chinese science, ancient Egyptian wisdom, and the baffling astronomical knowledge of the Dogon people of West Africa.\n\nIn his latest book, A New Science of Heaven, Temple explores a topic on the scientific vanguard—plasma.\n\nA gas composed of positive ions and free electrons, plasma makes up 99 percent of the matter of the universe. This interview, with Quest magazine editor Richard Smoley, will delve into this fascinating and provocative theme, including its implications for the human biome and esoteric ideas about the etheric body. Temple’s picture of plasma will overturn your current view of the universe.\n\nRobert Temple is the author of the new book A New Science of Heaven (Hodder & Stoughton). He has published many books and papers, and is particularly known for his early book The Sirius Mystery. His book The Genius of China, about 3,000 years of inventions and discoveries of the Chinese, has been published in forty-four languages and in six Chinese translations, and by UNESCO in minority languages. He and his wife Olivia are the authors of Aesop: The Complete Fables (a Penguin Classic) and The Sphinx Mystery. They have both done archaeometric work in Egypt and Robert has decoded the threefold geometrical enigma of the Giza Plateau in Egyptian Dawn and presented the clear evidence that the dates of the Old Kingdom require revision. Robert was appointed visiting professor of the history and philosophy of science at Tsinghua University in Beijing and adjunct professor of humanities, history, and philosophy of science at an American university.

Vigato","description":"In this lecture, author, researcher and explorer Marco Vigato talks about his search for the historical, as well as the esoteric, Atlantis.\n\nDrawing from hundreds of ancient and modern sources, Vigato paints a picture of Atlantis as the true cradle of mankind. Tracing the course of Atlantean civilization from its remote origins tens of thousands of years ago to the time of its collapse, Vigato explores the role that Atlantean survivors played in the development of the first great civilizations of the historical period. Leveraging his extensive travels and personal exploration of hundreds of archaeological sites around the world, Vigato presents the evidence for the former existence of a worldwide seafaring culture of prehistoric antiquity. \n\nIn the final part of the lecture, Vigato traces back the origins of what we may call the Western Esoteric Tradition to Atlantis. As another cycle of civilization approaches its end, it is only through the rediscovery of the Atlantean tradition that humanity may unlock the doors to a new Golden Age, or else face, like its predecessor, the fires of destruction.\n\nBuy Marco’s book The Empires of Atlantis here: https://amzn.to/3OxDJqk \n\nMarco M.

Along the way, as her interests shifted from pure materialist science to the space where science and spirituality merge, she came to believe that consciousness is the common underlying thread.\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Sobhani shares the research that transformed her from a diehard materialist to an open-minded spiritual seeker. She also discusses why neuroscience views subjective experience (including that of spirituality) with skepticism and explains away spiritual and mystical states with neural explanations, even though many scientists believe in exceptional human experiences and a higher power.\n---------------\nBuy Mona’s book Proof of Spiritual Phenomena: A Neuroscientist’s Discovery of the Ineffable Mysteries of the Universe: https://amzn.to/3AduveH \n\nMona Sobhani, Ph.D., is a cognitive neuroscientist, author, and entrepreneur.

In this presentation, Dr. Jeffery D. Long, after briefly introducing the texts themselves, describes the ways in which the Upanishads have shaped both Indian and Western thought. The reception of these profound and insightful writings will be explored across both time and space, from great Vedantic acharyas, or teachers, such as Shankara and Ramanuja, to the Mughal Emperor Dara Shikoh, to Western thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Ralph Waldo Emerson. \nThe message of the Upanishads is timeless, and thus as relevant today as when they were first revealed more than two millennia ago.\n--------\nJeffery D.

In particular, the Buddhist concept of nonduality — the realization that everything in the universe forms a single, integrated whole — is especially difficult to grasp. This is not just a philosophical problem: nonduality forms the bedrock of Zen ethics, and once we comprehend it, many of the perplexing aspects of Zen suddenly make sense. \nWhen we realize that our feeling of separateness from others is illusory, we have no desire to harm any creature.

He has found the truth of the vision of Oneness espoused in the Bhagavad Gita, where all of creation is seen as one unique existence. The results of such practice are happiness, clear thinking, peace of mind, self-sufficiency and fearlessness. In this presentation he discusses such topics as:\n\n* A scientific approach to meditation and its benefits\n* The problem of consciousness, particularly the notion that consciousness originates in the physical processes of the brain\n* The worldview of oneness which emerges from the practice of meditation\n* Quantum entanglement versus oneness\n* Shravan, manan, nididhyaasan: the three-step system for understanding the essential truth\n* The Bhagavad Gita\n\nGlen Kezwer holds a doctorate in physics. Since the early 80s, he has pursued a spiritual path which centers on the practice of meditation. He is the author of Meditation, Oneness and Physics and The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita, as well as many articles on science, meditation, and spirituality.

After witnessing the transformative power of these mind-altering plants, he embarked on a quest to understand their effects on human consciousness. This search led him to indigenous elder Rafael Chanchari Pizuri, who educated him about the proper way of approaching these powerful plant teachers.\n\nIn this interview conducted by Theosophical Society in America's Christopher Dixon, Jeremy explores what he learned from Pizuri, including the similarities between ayahuasca and tobacco, the role of these plants in indigenous cultures, and the hidden truths they reveal about nature.\n\nBuy the book here: https://amzn.to/37REBGa\n\nJeremy Narby, PhD, and Rafael Chanchari Pizuri are the authors of Plant Teachers. Jeremy became an early pioneer of ayahuasca research while living with the Ashaninca people of the Peruvian Amazon in the 1980s. He studied anthropology at Stanford University and now lives in Switzerland and works as Amazonian projects director for Nouvelle Planète, a nonprofit organization that promotes the economic and cultural empowerment of indigenous peoples. Rafael Chanchari Pizuri is a native of the Peruvian Amazon, an elder of the indigenous Shawi people, and a traditional healer. He lives in Iquitos, Peru, and teaches there in a bilingual education program.\n\n#ayahuasca #shamanism #plantmedicines \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oh2gqdE70PQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oh2gqdE70PQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oh2gqdE70PQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oh2gqdE70PQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oh2gqdE70PQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":195,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oh2gqdE70PQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Jfe4sFTvNN3ILQDyNb_vImRgT7M","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmV1VS1JUnNpUmJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-07-24T21:00:15Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Theosophical Movement and Its Importance with John Cooper | Theosophical Classic 1990","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nAn overview of the Theosophical movement as a whole.

Mitch’s books have appeared in Arabic, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, French, and Chinese. He received the Walden Award for Interfaith/Intercultural Understanding. The Chinese government has censored his work. Visit him at MitchHorowitz.com\n\nRichard Smoley is the author of twelve books on spirituality, philosophy, and religion.

The Jain tradition envisions the world as teeming with abundant, endless forms of life, present since beginningless time. Though these souls take different forms, they are indestructible, taking birth after birth, whether elemental, microbial, animal, infernal, or heavenly. Humans have the power to understand and reverse the bondage of karma. By adhering to nonviolent thought, word, and action, one can advance toward the eventual goal of perfect freedom.

But exactly how do we put this lofty principle into practice? From the street gangs and refugees of war-torn areas to returning war soldiers plagued with PTSD, from the untreated victims of disease to the homelessness spawned in the wake of recent tsunamis and hurricanes, man-made and natural disasters are plunging humanity into crises of unprecedented proportions. \n\nWhat can we do to help? Where do we begin? \n\nThe Southeast National Conference, Social Action as Spiritual Practice, was held in November 2007 to address these issues in a meaningful way. The idea for this conference originated by recognizing that although many of us long to contribute toward the alleviation of suffering, we may be uncertain as to how to go about it. By providing inspiration and resources for becoming involved, the benefits of this conference will be two-fold: social action grounded in personal spirituality will engender a more concerted effort for good in the world at large; and the more such action springs from a spiritual core, the greater its effect on one’s personal growth and consciousness. 3 of 7.

Scott teaches various practices to aid in this work, such as breathwork practices, meditation, and mantra. John Cianciosi, Director of Public Programs for the Theosophical Society, shares a dialogue with Scott and explores the many aspects of this spiritual practice for “waking up.”\n\nScott Schwenk’s teaching, through a mixture of dharma talks, meditations, and breathwork practices, guides seekers to explore their deepest selves leading them to live their lives free from tension and full of trust. Known for his hugely popular Wanderlust Festival workshops, his Unplug teaching, and online trainings, Scott has been catalyzing the inner evolution of others for decades: helping them to grow, transform obstacles into opportunities, and find Love within. Scott spent several years living and studying in a Hindu monastery which introduced him to the core body of Tantric traditions, which continue to flow through each of his teachings. Apprenticeships in leadership development, meditation and philosophy training, spiritual awakening, and Vedic rituals were all part of Scott’s development into the thought-leader that he is today.\n\n#mediation #mantra #breathwork \n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZKjG27lRVE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZKjG27lRVE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZKjG27lRVE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZKjG27lRVE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZKjG27lRVE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":213,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bZKjG27lRVE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fHxO0BOgofvewFNXQiO-EkFj-cM","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLl9ubl84WS1mOHMw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-06-05T22:00:21Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Adventure of Dying: Part 1 with Glenn Mullin | Theosophical Classic 2011","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nExplore the esoteric meaning of dying, rebirth, and enlightenment; and how we might prepare ourselves for death.

How can a song on the radio stir up powerful emotions, from joy to anger, regret to desire? Why does sound itself evoke such primal and deeply felt emotions? What are the other untapped properties of sound as a technology for human potential? Sound is a vibration that travels through air, water and solids and therefore through the human body. Sound has the capacity to shift neurochemistry and neurobiology in a profound and unprecedented way as a therapeutic tool as well as a technique to unleash human potential. It’s produced by all matter and is a fundamental part of survival for every species because our brains are wired to immediately shift in response to sound. Yet there is a hidden power within sound that has only begun to be investigated. In this dynamic presentation, Dr. Kulreet Chaudhary demonstrates how you can use sound to improve your mental and physical wellbeing, taking you on a journey through the most ancient texts of India, the Siddha palm leaf tests, and into modern quantum physics. Dr. Chaudhary explains how sound impacts the human body and brain uniquely, and explores the physiological effects of sound vibration, from altering mood to healing disease to connecting to one’s higher consciousness. This revolutionary approach combines biology, quantum physics and ancient mystical practices and will demonstrate how individuals can use sound to improve their mental and physical wellbeing by creating inner coherence, which benefits the individual, our community and our workplace. Dr. Kulreet Chaudhary takes audiences members on a journey into sound unlike anything presented to the modern world.\n\nDr. Kulreet Chaudhary is a neurologist, neuroscientist, and leader in the ancient science of health known as Ayurveda. This rare combination of expertise gives her a unique perspective on healing that has helped thousands of people feel better and achieve health goals they never thought possible. Dr. Chaudhary is a regular guest on The Dr. Oz Show, where her teachings about Ayurvedic medicine have been applauded by a national audience. In addition to her decades as a practitioner and educator, Dr. Chaudhary remains committed to advancing medical research and has participated in over 20 clinical studies in the areas of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Her contributions include groundbreaking work in stem cell therapies for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and drug development for the treatment of ALS, as well as hands-on discoveries of ancient Siddha Medicine texts in Tamil Nadu, India.

Long, Ph.D.","description":"Though it is less well-known in the Western world than the paths of Hinduism and Buddhism, the Jain tradition of India has been a vital source of wisdom for thousands of years. This tradition is best known for its profound commitment to ahimsa: nonviolence in thought, word, and action. To this end, the Jains created the world’s first known animal hospitals. The Jain observance of strict vegetarianism has also shaped Hindu and Buddhist practice, and the Jain ideal of nonviolence was a strong influence on the thought of Mahatma Gandhi, who grew up in a part of India where Jain traditions have long been prominent. This presentation will begin with a broad overview of Jain thought and practice for those who are unfamiliar with this tradition, and then focus on a unique Jain contribution to universal wisdom in the form of the Jain doctrines of relativity–anekāntavāda, nayavāda, and syādvāda–which teach that reality is many-sided, and that this many-sidedness gives rise to the diverse views and paths of the world’s religions and philosophies.\n\nJeffery D. Long is Professor of Religion and Asian Studies at Elizabethtown College, in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. His graduate degrees are from the University of Chicago Divinity School and his undergraduate degree is from the University of Notre Dame. He also studied for two years at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India. Jeffery is the author of A Vision for Hinduism (2007), Jainism: An Introduction (2009), The Historical Dictionary of Hinduism (2011), and Hinduism in America: A Convergence of Worlds (2020), as well as a variety of articles and essays in edited volumes available on Amazon.com.\n\nBuy Jainism: An Introduction: https://amzn.to/3ER1e9M\n\n#jains #jainism #nonviolence\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUsDCDQ36uY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUsDCDQ36uY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUsDCDQ36uY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUsDCDQ36uY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUsDCDQ36uY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":218,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ZUsDCDQ36uY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"9xb-TFLHJxEbvGNmLDphZRrZ7Eo","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjExVkNqVXZvUkI4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-25T01:39:14Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Start in the Personal Universe by Being and Creating the Change You Want","description":"Clipped from Manifesting through the Chakras: How to Clear Blocks and Strengthen the Power of Your Intentions with Anodea Judith, February 5, 2022.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11VCjUvoRB8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11VCjUvoRB8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11VCjUvoRB8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11VCjUvoRB8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11VCjUvoRB8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":219,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"11VCjUvoRB8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"otx60dFWhu--6TU-FmBmFX62Ldw","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmc5T1NSWVprWmNZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-22T22:00:30Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Theosophy and the World Religions with Robert Ellwood | Theosophical Classic 2009","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nThis program was recorded at the 123rd Annual Summer National Gathering of the Theosophical Society in America.

And the intentions behind the sound have powerful effects in the world. Kathleen Riley discusses the power and potential of intentionality as expressed through spoken word, sound, and music in these extraordinary times of shift and change for humanity and our world. In particular, Kathleen introduces the tuning of self, a belief that has its roots in many cultures and traditions. She discusses heart/brain coherence and the transformative effects achieved at group levels of heart-based communication. Having collaborated on research with the HeartMath Institute, Kathleen also discusses how our sounds, spoken word, music, thoughts, attitudes, and emotions affect the Earth’s magnetic field lines. They are plucked, like guitar strings, by the solar wind.\n\nKathleen Riley, Ph.D., is a pianist, researcher, lecturer, teacher, and writer with a mission to help people connect more deeply with their purpose and heart’s intelligence, voicing it through their creativity. Post-doctoral studies in neurophysiology, psychology, and biofeedback allowed her to teach people how to shift into coherence and align with purpose and clarity to their vision. While living in Cleveland, Ohio, Kathleen served on faculty at the Cleveland Institute of Music where she designed courses in this alignment, Optimal Performance, and ran a biofeedback lab. Her latest research study explored the effects of a shared heart intention among members of a string quartet. The research was filmed and produced as a documentary: Intention: The Power of the Heart. In response to COVID-19, she created the Global Coherent Performers Community on Facebook, designed to bring performers and researchers together to understand and explore new innovative ways to communicate through sound and music. She also convenes sessions for Ubiquity University Humanity Rising Global Solutions Summit on the transformative effects of music and the arts on coherence and consciousness.\n\n#heartmath #chanting #soundhealing\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EtAmQ5jzZUs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EtAmQ5jzZUs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EtAmQ5jzZUs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EtAmQ5jzZUs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EtAmQ5jzZUs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":227,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"EtAmQ5jzZUs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"AmUy-_7SzWk3DIIJjVaPIUaIpOs","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnVKYTlsNDZhX2w0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-05-01T21:00:18Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Still Point Between Good and Evil with Ed Abdill | Theosophical Classic 2001","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nA presentation at the 114th Annual Meeting and Summer School of the Theosophical Society in America, questioning the existence of inherent evil and suggesting that it is we, as human beings, who are responsible for our experiences of both good and evil.

Yet the reality of love is rarely brought into our daily practice in a real and meaningful way. It often remains an ideal, while duality and fear continue to be our modus operandi in the world at large. \n\nThis talk by spiritual teacher, author, and poet John Siddique draws on material from his new book Signposts of The Spiritual Journey, and explores how the path of love is available to us in this very moment in each of our ordinary lives. John shares practices that easily move us beyond the idea of love into greater meaning, actuality, and truth.\n\nJohn Siddique is the author of Signposts of The Spiritual Journey and SO, and is a much-loved spiritual teacher, writer, and poet, best known for his authenticity, humor, and “feet on the ground” wisdom. His teachings have helped millions of people worldwide find greater peace and fulfilment. Yet his work is not about gathering followers or preaching a particular spirituality. Rather, it is his deepest wish that his teachings are a space for transformation for you so that you may authentically know and live from your soul. John’s study of meditation, yoga and inner healing began at the age of fourteen, at first from books, then in the deep practical study of the great religions and practices, before setting all labels aside after a series of profound shifts in consciousness that included a near-death experience in 2014. He is the author of eight books so far, and he has published numerous pieces around the world, including Time, Eden, and Platinum magazines, in The Guardian newspaper and on the BBC. John is a commissioning editor for the Royal Literary Fund. He is also an Honorary Fellow of Literature at Leicester University.\n\nBuy Signposts of The Spiritual Journey: https://amzn.to/3Lw9GO0\n\n#spirituality #meditation #love\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/79fB5lnneH8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/79fB5lnneH8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/79fB5lnneH8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/79fB5lnneH8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/79fB5lnneH8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":229,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"79fB5lnneH8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"IWZhEOd67LaauvS_0aogHVLHnSA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmFmbWlzT25SUVhv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-04-24T21:00:02Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Cosmos, Soul, and Holy Ecology with Gabrielle Uhlein | Theosophical Classic 2010","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nDiscover earth-care as soul-care and share in what Thomas Berry called “The Great Work” – to assist “the human community toward a more appropriate relationship with this stupendous creation…” Using his writings and remarkable images of the cosmos and the world, participants will experience the awe and exuberance that was Thomas Berry’s hallmark approach to the Creation and to the Divine.

The climate crisis is not a science problem. It is a human problem. The ultimate power to change the world does not reside in technologies. It relies on reverence, respect, and compassion—for ourselves, all people, all life.” So says Paul Hawken, author of the New York Times bestselling book, \"\"Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation,\"\" and one of the leading voices of the environmental movement.\n\nIn this conversation with Theosophical Society in America host Chris Bolger, Paul explores his multifaceted approach to addressing this challenge. What is it about humanity that can't or won't act towards achieving these goals? How can we get humans to act to bring about the changes that we know are necessary? How is climate change a spiritual and ethical dilemma? With a focus on the unity and interconnectedness of all life, Paul will discuss how we, as individuals, can make a meaningful impact on this looming crisis.\n\nBuy the book Regeneration here: https://amzn.to/36GB6Bo \n\nPaul Hawken starts ecological businesses, writes about nature and commerce, and consults with heads of state and CEOs on climatic, economic and ecological regeneration. He has appeared on numerous media including the Today Show, Talk of the Nation, Bill Maher, CBS This Morning and others, and his work has been profiled or featured in hundreds of articles including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Newsweek, Washington Post, Forbes, and Business Week. He has written nine books including six national and NYT bestsellers: Growing a Business, The Next Economy, The Ecology of Commerce, Blessed Unrest, Drawdown, and Regeneration. He is published in 30 languages and his books are available in over 90 countries. He is the founder of both Project Drawdown and Project Regeneration (regeneration.org).

In this groundbreaking lecture, Richard Smoley, author of \"\"Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism,\"\" presents a radical new theory. He argues that Gnosticism arose out of the failure of apocalyptic expectations in early Christianity: the first Christians believed that the end of the world was coming soon, but it did not. Gnosticism arose out of this disappointment. Richard also explains the basics of Gnosticism. Take this opportunity to hear his bold new thesis. \n\nRichard Smoley is the author of twelve books on spirituality, philosophy, and religion. His latest book, \"\"Introduction to the Occult,\"\" was published in January 2022 by GD Media. Richard’s book A Theology of Love: Reimagining Christianity through “A Course in Miracles” was published in November 2019 by Inner Traditions International. His other works include Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition; Supernatural: Writings on an Unknown History; The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe: Conscious Love: Insights from Mystical Christianity; The Essential Nostradamus; and Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions (with Jay Kinney).

By using the best of both Tibetan Buddhist and Western dream-work techniques, bestselling author and teacher Charlie Morley offers a uniquely holistic approach to lucid dreaming and conscious sleeping that will help with psychological growth and developing a deeper spiritual practice. This talk includes an overview of the history, science, and practice of lucid dreaming from the Western psychological and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, and instructions on how to engage the wider holistic benefits of lucid dreaming and conscious sleeping.\n\nLucid dreaming is an important precursory skill to the Tibetan tradition of Dream Yoga, and these teachings offer a practical way to learn this incredibly beneficial skill. Learn how being aware within your dreams and tapping into the wellspring of wisdom that resides in the dreaming mind allows you to wake up to life and live lucidly with joy and confidence!\n\nCharlie Morley is a bestselling author and teacher of lucid dreaming, shadow integration, and mindfulness of dream & sleep. He has been lucid dreaming for over 20 years and was authorized to teach within the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism by Lama Yeshe Rinpoche in 2008.

Female leadership was highly unusual in spiritual and religious organizations at that time, so naturally the organization attracted other powerful women who also contributed to the spreading of Theosophical ideas. Join us to find out more about three such women—Constanze Wachtmeister, a contemporary of Helen Blavatsky, Wanda Dynowska, a contemporary of Annie Besant, and Dora Kunz, co-creator of Therapeutic Touch and former president of the society— and how their contributions can inspire our work in the 21st century.\n\nWatch more videos on Theosophy here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtuDWE10sVdWJ_r3V2H7lSYsU-fTqAnx \n\n\nSusanne Hoepfl-Wellenhofer was born in Austria and has been living and working in the U.S. since 1986. Even before finding Theosophy in 2010, she had been following her own spiritual path, comparing religion, science, philosophy, and psychology for over 20 years. She is currently the president of the Washington, D.C. Lodge and recently created a course for the Online School of Theosophy. She has a law degree from the University of Graz and a master’s degree in educational technology from George Washington University, where she worked for 20 years before retiring in 2019.

However, Zoroaster’s religious, intellectual, and ethical influences permeate history. Although popularized in recent times by Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra, Zoroaster was probably the first philosopher whose theosophical revolution three millennia ago introduced the ideas of reason, truth, unity, law, liberty, free will, good ethics, and social engagement into the fabric of human thinking. Here is an invitation to a deep history with profound relevance to the world we live in.\n\nRasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., is a professor of geology at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. His life spans Iran and India, where he first encountered the Zoroastrian religion, as well as the U.S. His lifelong interest in the interface of science, philosophy, and spiritual traditions has resulted in a large number of articles published in Quest, Interreligious Insight, Light of Consciousness, Resurgence, Pure Inspiration, Mandala, Sufi, Rumi Review, Tiferet, Yoga & Health, Himalayan Journal, Kyoto Journal, Persian Heritage, The World and I, and others.

Once an esoteric topic only familiar to people with interests in Eastern spiritual traditions such as Buddhism, today mindfulness is commonplace, with books, magazines, videos, podcasts, and training programs readily available for consumption. However, the popularity of mindfulness may have outstripped a true understanding of its use and limitations. Rather than being an all-purpose panacea that can solve all problems, mindfulness is a conditioned mental quality that can be used for both positive and negative purposes. Thus, the Buddha encouraged the development of Right Mindfulness, not just any mindfulness. In this lecture we will explore what constitutes Right Mindfulness as distinct from ordinary self-awareness, or knowing, that is common to all of us.\n\nJohn Cianciosi was ordained a Buddhist monk in Thailand in 1972 and trained under one of that country’s most gifted and influential meditation masters, the late Venerable Ajahn Chah. While living in remote jungle monasteries, he led a disciplined, celibate life devoted to the practice of mental cultivation. Later, he was appointed abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat, the International Forest Monastery established to provide training for the growing number of Ajahn Chah’s Western disciples. In 1982, he was asked to establish a Buddhist monastery in Perth, Western Australia. For the next 14 years, he was instrumental in successfully establishing Bodhinyana Monastery and Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre. In 1995 he left the monastic life and moved to the Chicago, Illinois area, where he continues to share his insights and wisdom. He is the author of The Meditative Path and is currently the director of public programs at the Theosophical Society in America.\n\nBuy The Meditative Path: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=742&search=the+meditative+path&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true \n\nWatch more talks on Buddhism here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtuDWE10sVckkurUKh_dHrBuunwKhS46\n\n#Buddhism #mindfulness #Buddha\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eCiRLwQEvhA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eCiRLwQEvhA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eCiRLwQEvhA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eCiRLwQEvhA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eCiRLwQEvhA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":246,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eCiRLwQEvhA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"oT4__soxYHOkBQDnif0d8NrmnDM","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmx1TXlXMG01U0M4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-02-27T22:30:03Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Secret Gateway with Ed Abdill | Theosophical Classic 2006","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nBased on his book of the same title, the speaker examines the basic ideas of Theosophy in a clear, simple, and sometimes humorous manner that most anyone can understand.

This beauty arises when all the elements are in harmony and in the right proportion. This is true of all paintings, sculpture, architecture, music, and design. There is no book or instruction manual that can teach that harmony and balance; one learns through trial and error. When beauty is achieved, it creates joy in the consciousness of the observer. This is also true of human life and all our relationships, not only to people but also to property, work, Nature, pleasure, and oneself. It requires a harmonious blend of the physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects of life. Learning to attain this balance cannot be learned from a book or a teacher. Such learning is the highest art: the art of living. In this lecture, Professor Padmanabhan Krishna draws on the teachings of Krishnamurti and others to help us discover the art of living for ourselves by approaching life with a learning mind instead of an achieving mind. Wisdom is a by-product of such learning, and it is essential to leading a harmonious, creative and happy life.\n\nProfessor Padmanabhan Krishna is a Trustee of the Krishnamurti Foundation India. He has written articles and books on various issues relating to the teachings of J. Krishnamurti, and has delivered lectures on education, science and society around the world. He is an honorary scientist and fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi, as well as the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore. Before joining the Krishnamurti Foundation in India, he was a professor of physics at Banaras Hindu University, where he was a faculty member for 24 years. He specializes in solid state physics with a specialty in X-ray crystallography. His talks can be read at www.pkrishna.org.

In particular, they discuss the ability of humming—the simplest self-created sound—to reduce stress, enhance relaxation, strengthen our immune system, lower heart rate and blood pressure, release melatonin, generate nitric oxide, and resonate different parts of the body for an internal, therapeutic massage. Conscious humming creates resonance and intention that can manifest extraordinary benefits for body, mind and spirit.

Instead of treating meditation as a mental practice, what if we explore and understand it as a fundamentally visceral one? In what ways might the Buddhist path to liberation be a somatic practice of an ever-deepening attunement to the wisdom of our bodies? Might this help us enrich our practice?

Teaching worldwide since 1999, Martin co-founded Moulin de Chaves, the retreat center where he lives and teaches in France, the Mindfulness Training Institute, and the online dharma community Sangha Live.

This practice supports wholeness and well-being through guided immersion in forests and other natural environments.

It is this fear that creates a reluctance to live life to its fullest. Clare Goldsberry’s journey through the illness and death of her partner gave her an extraordinary new understanding of the meaning of life and why we create our world as we do, and of how we die. Death is not the end-game of life but merely the transition from one experience to another as consciousness moves us through different levels of awareness. Presented on January 20, 2022.\n\nClare will discuss:\n      • How mind creates matter and why we perceive phenomena as “reality.”\n      • Why identification with our physical bodies promotes fear.\n      • How fear and uncertainty creates suffering.\n      • How we can transcend suffering and learn to live in equanimity, helping\n         us to live well so that we can die well.\n\n#deathanddying #theosophy #spirituality\n\nClare Goldsberry is a lifelong student of Theosophy and many other spiritual traditions. She has carefully studied how these traditions intersect with quantum physics. Clare has developed a number of creative classes on topics including quantum Buddhism, the nature of reality, and consciousness. She teaches classes on a variety of spiritual traditions in the Phoenix area. Clare's new book, The Illusion of Life and Death includes a foreword by author, scholar, and Quest magazine editor Richard Smoley.

And yet, what takes place within our minds feels decidedly real.\n\nThose who have had a near-death experience attest to a realm that is \"\"more real than real,\"\" and yet, it all happens beyond the observation of others, completely within the mind. It's no wonder that such experiences are refuted by some as hallucinations, since secular Western thought maintains that only the physical world is real and everything else is an illusion. But repeated experiments in quantum physics offer significant evidence that the role of our mind is more significant than materialist science would suggest. Gaining firsthand awareness of this connection is vital so we can realize our true place in the universe as sentient beings. To truly know yourself is to realize you are fundamentally spiritual and connected through one consciousness by the binding force of love.\n\nEben Alexander, M.D., was an academic neurosurgeon for over 25 years, including 15 years at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital, and Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\n#nde #lifeafterdeath #consciousness","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gk34eUJVNcE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gk34eUJVNcE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gk34eUJVNcE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gk34eUJVNcE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gk34eUJVNcE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":262,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"gk34eUJVNcE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"sPe_uPhUEgcpPP3w3CTET6PmmCo","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnFwbHltd0UycnA4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-29T01:07:47Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"What Does Mantra Actually Mean?","description":"To learn more, watch The Healing Power of Mantras workshop here: https://bit.ly/3z6Ti1o\n\nIn this workshop, renowned healing scientist and teacher Dr. Shamini Jain will show you how to activate mantras more deeply for healing, by powerfully connecting your voice with your biofield, or energy field.

But exactly how do we put this lofty principle into practice? From the street gangs and refugees of war-torn areas to returning war soldiers plagued with PTSD, from the untreated victims of disease to the homelessness spawned in the wake of recent tsunamis and hurricanes, man-made and natural disasters are plunging humanity into crises of unprecedented proportions. \n\nWhat can we do to help? Where do we begin? \n\nThe Southeast National Conference, Social Action as Spiritual Practice, was held in November 2007 to address these issues in a meaningful way. The idea for this conference originated by recognizing that although many of us long to contribute toward the alleviation of suffering, we may be uncertain as to how to go about it. By providing inspiration and resources for becoming involved, the benefits of this conference will be two-fold: social action grounded in personal spirituality will engender a more concerted effort for good in the world at large; and the more such action springs from a spiritual core, the greater its effect on one’s personal growth and consciousness. 4 of 7.

Amit will demonstrate how the marriage of science and spirituality and the cooperation of scientists and mystics can open the door to a new worldview. We will address the broad aspects of the spiritual heart (which, not by coincidence, is called by many \"\"our home\"\") from a variety of traditions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism, and Hinduism, blended naturally with the quantum science viewpoint.\n\nAmit Goswami, Ph.D. is a retired professor of physics from the University of Oregon where he served from 1968-1997. In 1985, he discovered the solution to the quantum measurement problem and developed a science of experience explicating how consciousness splits into subject and object. Subsequently, he developed a theory of reincarnation and integrated conventional and alternative medicine within the new quantum science of health. Among his discoveries are the quantum theory of the creative process, the theory of quantum evolution, the science of love and happiness, the theory of quantum economics that extends Adam’s Smith’s capitalism into a workable paradigm for the 21st century, and the theory of quantum spirituality based on the exploration of wholeness. \n\nBuy Amit’s books\nThe Self-Aware Universe: https://amzn.to/3o78ias\nPhysics of the Soul: https://amzn.to/3n7jNj3\n\n#quantum #science #spirituality\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IC5y-HgY6Ic/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IC5y-HgY6Ic/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IC5y-HgY6Ic/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IC5y-HgY6Ic/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IC5y-HgY6Ic/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":267,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IC5y-HgY6Ic"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"LS1gpgy0WyjVptAIFHzn2weWJag","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnMyQnZOdHEzWlNr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-15T01:09:08Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"\"The sun, as a living entity, is constitutionally the same as a human being.\"","description":"Clipped from The Solar Angel: The Soul and Its Spiritual Companion\n\nFor those who are consciously walking the Path, the search for the soul is a central feature on the journey toward enlightenment.

Teaching centers, monasteries, and sanghas sprouting up as Western-born leaders reframe ancient principles in contemporary Western terms. John Cianciosi, Director of Public Programs for the Theosophical Society shares a dialogue with Ajahn Sona, a senior Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition, exploring a variety of subjects such as the state of Buddhism in America today, the meaning of “enlightenment” and how it is achieved, Buddhist views on ecology, and more.\n\nTo watch more videos on Buddhism, click here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRtuDWE10sVckkurUKh_dHrBuunwKhS46 \n\nAjahn Sona is a first-wave Western Theravada ordained monk and the Abbot of Birken Forest Buddhist Monastery (‘Birken’). With over thirty years in the robes, he is now referred to as ‘Luang Por’ (‘Venerable Father’) by his closest disciples – a traditional honorific for senior monks of the Thai Forest Tradition. Ajahn Sona took full monastic ordination in 1989 at the first Theravada forest monastery in the United States. He later switched to the Thai Forest Tradition and trained at Ajahn Chah’s monasteries in northeastern Thailand for several years. Ajahn Sona now draws on both the Sri Lankan and Thai scholastic and meditative traditions in his teachings, in addition to his modern western sensibilities. His pre-monastic education in philosophy, humanities, and classical Western music have aided him in understanding the Western psyche and in establishing paradigm bridges between East and West. Ajahn Sona is also deeply interested in the ecological movements of this environmentally critical time, both at the practical and philosophical levels. The off-grid monastery, which he has carefully curated over the last two decades, employs the latest in green design technologies and principles.\n\n#buddhism #enlightenment #Theravada\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFtvc6G9MT8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFtvc6G9MT8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFtvc6G9MT8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFtvc6G9MT8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFtvc6G9MT8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":270,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rFtvc6G9MT8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dorPH8sCXT3ujHPmpkrzCssTOiw","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkNSY0RPSDlIMFZN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-12-08T19:49:32Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Evidence For Life After Death: Parts 1 - 2 with Dr. Ian Stevenson | Theosophical Classic 2004","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nThis 4-part series explores much of the convincing evidence for life after death as suggested by the many accounts of apparitions and death-bed visions compiled by Dr. Ian Stevenson, who was the founder of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia.

In this public presentation, historian and popular voice of esoteric ideas Mitch Horowitz considers the current state of metaphysics and whether we are turning a corner in our understanding of the human psyche. Mitch considers how recent developments in psychical research, interdimensional studies, the UFO thesis, and mind-body medicine are leading us toward a new estimation of human nature that may prove as radical to our time as Darwinism did to the Victorian era. Presented on November 18, 2021.\n\nThis special talk also heralds the launch of Mitch’s acclaimed Modern Occultism course as a 12-part streaming series on Vimeo, and highlights some of its key themes.\n\nA widely known voice of esoteric ideas, Mitch Horowitz is a writer-in-residence at the New York Public Library, lecturer-in-residence at the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles, and the PEN Award-winning author of books including Occult America, The Miracle Club, and the forthcoming Daydream Believer. The Washington Post says Mitch “treats esoteric ideas and movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness that is too often lost in today’s raised-voice discussions.” Mitch’s books have appeared in Arabic, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and Chinese. He received the Walden Award for Interfaith Understanding. China’s government has censored his work.\n\n#occult #esoteric #occultism\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_atYDdRpqr4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_atYDdRpqr4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_atYDdRpqr4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_atYDdRpqr4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_atYDdRpqr4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":276,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_atYDdRpqr4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4qUKOMo9c0JeSq3Axu-RbT2jNow","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnBEckd5N0poY3o4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-17T01:15:02Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Understanding and Applying Discernment","description":"Clipped from Rumi and the Art of Discernment with Pouria Montazeri\n\nWatch the entire workshop here: https://bit.ly/3czQcst\n\n#discernment #rumi","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDrGy7Jhcz8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDrGy7Jhcz8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDrGy7Jhcz8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDrGy7Jhcz8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDrGy7Jhcz8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":277,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pDrGy7Jhcz8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NiMMwHL0l70jh3kuAMfO61frwmE","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnhrSzZiWTByZ3c0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-11-14T23:00:16Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Healing Our Religious Wounds: Part 2 with Bishop John Shelby Spong | Theosophical Classic 2010","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nAs an activist, speaker, and author, Bishop John Shelby Spong is an outspoken advocate for church reform.

Philosophers and scientists tend to give very different answers to this question. The materialist view of many physicists and scientists tells us that energy and matter are fundamental, implying that physical reality is ultimately what is real. On the other hand, idealists believe that consciousness and the mind are the fundamental reality. Idealists argue that things like particles and brain matter are actually best thought of as ideas in consciousness. Richard Smoley, editor of Quest: Journal of the Theosophical Society in America will share a dialogue with CERN scientist and philosopher Bernardo Kastrup, Ph.D. to explore a wide range of questions regarding the human condition, the nature of reality, the hard problem of consciousness, and the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. They will also discuss the great opportunities for spiritual growth open to humanity at this critical time. Presented on November 11, 2021.\n\nBernardo Kastrup, Ph.D. is the executive director of Essentia Foundation. His work has been dedicated to leading the modern renaissance of metaphysical idealism: the notion that reality is essentially mental. Bernardo has doctorates in philosophy and computer engineering. He has worked for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Philips Research Laboratories. His ideas have been presented in Scientific American, the Institute of Art and Ideas, the blog of the American Philosophical Association, and Big Think, among others.

Explore the power of sound, its relationship with the etheric realms, some of its cosmological implications, and its link with human intuition.\nThe use of intuition and creative imagination has been an essential part of the work of great scientists and artists. How were great composers, scientists, and thinkers able to “sense” higher realities, translate them, and then step them down into concrete thoughts, music, words, or mathematical formulae? Does the universe or planet sound our own notes, or do we?\nThese reflections will take us to the core of the matter: What is meant by “The Harmony of the Spheres,” which famed occultist H.P. Blavatsky claimed not to be a mere philosophical fancy, but a reality?\n\nEduardo Javier Gramaglia holds a degree in classical philology from National University. He gives seminars, workshops, and lectures on a wide range of Theosophical subjects. His main area of research is the late Hellenistic tradition, particularly its hermetic texts on mystery traditions and astrology. He published Hermetic Astrology in 2006, the first book in Spanish on the ancient astrological traditions. He has taken part in international conventions, given seminars, and published two English translations of Ancient Greek astrological manuals. Eduardo teaches Ancient Religion and Myth, as well as Sanskrit language and literature at National University.

The first is that the mind appears to have access to information unbound by the ordinary senses or the everyday constraints of space and time. The second is that the mind seems to be able to directly influence matter from a distance. Quantum mechanics has the same two mysteries. In this domain the first is called \"\"nonlocality,\"\" and the second is known as the \"\"observer\"\" effect. Are these shared mysteries merely a coincidence, or do they suggest a common source? Two theoretical approaches will be discussed, along with supporting experimental results.

These phenomena happen when the energy of the human soul interfaces briefly with the higher vibration of the Afterlife Frequency. This interdimensional communication occurs in the NDE Zone—between our material world dimension and the Other Side dimension. One of the most profound aspects of these phenomena is encountering the Light. Since ancient times, belief systems worldwide describe an encounter with the Divine Power known as God in terms of light. Albert Einstein said, “We are all Light Beings.” Light is also the only form of electromagnetic energy visible to the human eye. World-renowned psychic Mark Anthony takes viewers on an entertaining and educational journey into the past to uncover how contact with the NDE Zone has impacted humanity. From the cosmic to the subatomic, Mark explains our present understanding of The NDE ZONE through quantum physics and concludes by looking toward future discoveries yet to be revealed from the NDE Zone. Presented on October 14, 2021.\n\nMark Anthony, JD, Psychic Explorer is the author of The Afterlife Frequency, Never Letting Go and Evidence of Eternity.

It is argued that even a description of physical perception requires a 5-dimensional model, with the 5th dimension being associated with mental time. This proposal may relate to recent developments in brane cosmology and impinges on two problems on the borders of physics and philosophy: the relationship between physical space and perceptual space and the passage of time. A description of non-physical perception, including dreams, OBEs, NDEs and some mystical states, may require further dimensions, suggesting a higher-dimensional “reality structure”, which is reminiscent of some ideas already proposed by modern physics. A description of consciousness must entail a proper understanding of the specious present, the minimum timescale of conscious experience, and this may also relate to higher dimensions.\n\nBernard Carr is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at Queen Mary University of London. His professional area of research is cosmology and relativistic astrophysics and includes such topics as the early universe, black holes, dark matter, and the anthropic principle. His recent books are Universe or Multiverse? (2007) and Quantum Black Holes (2014). He believes that physics must expand to accommodate consciousness and mental phenomena. Professor Carr is President of the Scientific and Medical Network and former president of the Society for Psychical Research.

But exactly how do we put this lofty principle into practice? From the street gangs and refugees of war-torn areas to returning war soldiers plagued with PTSD, from the untreated victims of disease to the homelessness spawned in the wake of recent tsunamis and hurricanes, man-made and natural disasters are plunging humanity into crises of unprecedented proportions. \n\nWhat can we do to help? Where do we begin? \n\nThe Southeast National Conference, Social Action as Spiritual Practice, was held in November 2007 to address these issues in a meaningful way. The idea for this conference originated by recognizing that although many of us long to contribute toward the alleviation of suffering, we may be uncertain as to how to go about it. By providing inspiration and resources for becoming involved, the benefits of this conference will be two-fold: social action grounded in personal spirituality will engender a more concerted effort for good in the world at large; and the more such action springs from a spiritual core, the greater its effect on one’s personal growth and consciousness. 2 of 7.

Dr. Jude Currivan calls this a WholeWorld-View, which integrates a unitive understanding of the nature of reality, shows that the appearance of our Universe emerges from deeper levels of causation, and that mind and consciousness aren’t what we have but what we and the whole world are. It reveals a Universe of meaning and purpose that embodies an impulse to evolve from simplicity to complexity and ever-greater self-awareness. Synergizing with universal wisdom teachings such as Theosophy has the potential to help heal our fragmented perspectives and empower our conscious evolution. Presented on September 30, 2021.\n\nDr. Jude Currivan is a cosmologist, planetary healer, and author. She was previously one of the most senior business women in the UK, and co-founder of WholeWorld-View. She has experienced multidimensional realities since early childhood. Dr. Currivan holds a Ph.D. in Archaeology from the University of Reading in the UK and a Master’s Degree in Physics from Oxford University, specializing in cosmology and quantum physics. International author of six nonfiction books, her latest is The Cosmic Hologram: Information at the Center of Creation. Her next book Gaia: Her-Story is due to be published in 2022.

But hungry ghosts know the error of their ways, and they sometimes appear among humans—like the ghosts that haunt Ebenezer Scrooge—as augurs of what may await. Humans, they know, have a tendency to cultivate eanness (mātsarya), which makes those people cruel, immoral, and oblivious to their own self-righteousness. That meanness can lead to madness and misery. Thankfully, hungry ghosts offer unique insight into the human condition, and can provide us with the solution to this problem.\n\nAndy Rotman is a professor of Religion, Buddhism, and South Asian Studies at Smith College. He has been engaged in textual and ethnographic work on life in South Asia for more than 25 years.

Such a person is then recognized as a lighted lamp. \n\nJoin William Meader in this four-part class and interactive workshop starting October 11 - learn more here: https://www.theosophical.org/program/webinars/5162-the-lighted-lamp-an-exploration-of-the-soul-s-creative-process\n\n#philosophy #spiritual #soulful","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pklve_D-a3s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pklve_D-a3s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pklve_D-a3s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pklve_D-a3s/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pklve_D-a3s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":298,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Pklve_D-a3s"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"PP7j71m2pXyJ6CTdI-m72vwEt7c","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjB3UERVTXNmYllz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-09-17T00:00:10Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Contemporary Paganism, Wicca, and Witchcraft: Foundations of the Craft of the Wise | Gwendolyn Reece","description":"There is a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion about Paganism and Wicca, often with some negative historical Christian connotations.

Steve will share some examples of these extraordinary awakenings from his research and explain the reasons why intense suffering can cause them. He will also explain what we can learn from the phenomenon and teach some principles that can apply to our own spiritual development.

Non-attachment to outcomes, surrendering desires, accepting the present, opening to a higher power, relinquishing the ego, forgiveness… these all require us to let go.  But letting go is not always easy, especially when we think of it as getting rid of a disturbing thought or feeling. Bestselling author and meditation teacher Peter Russell reframes letting go not as another task we need to do, but as a letting go of any expectation or control. The beauty of this approach is that nothing needs to be changed or eliminated.\n\nPeter will explore why we hold on and how it veils our true nature, causing much of our suffering. He will show how letting go is key to meditation—allowing the thinking mind to quieten so that we can experience the intrinsic peace of our natural mind, unperturbed by worry and concern. Here, we can be more in touch with our hearts and our innate wisdom, and taste the awakening that all the great mystics and spiritual teachers have spoken of.\n\nPeter Russell is a leading thinker on consciousness and contemporary spirituality. He coined the term \"\"global brain\"\" with his 1980's bestseller of the same name in which he predicted the internet and the impact it would have on humanity. Peter studied theoretical physics, experimental psychology, and computer science at the University of Cambridge, and meditation and Eastern Philosophy in India. Peter pioneered the introduction of personal growth programs to corporations, running courses for senior management on creativity, stress management and sustainable development. He has been teaching meditation for over 40 years.\n\n#consciousness #spirituality #selfhelp\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N12hSpXfETA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N12hSpXfETA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N12hSpXfETA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N12hSpXfETA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N12hSpXfETA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":305,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"N12hSpXfETA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"AitZrNwyptTvM1EsXxgnw30u5mA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmtFVTNtV0hRc3dF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-29T22:00:12Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Spiritual Dimension of Time Travel with Fred Alan Wolf | Theosophical Classic 2004","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nBy examining the ideas of quantum physics and the ancient wisdom, the author of the book, \"The Yoga of Time Travel,\" suggests that we are now able to comprehend how the concepts of time and mind are reconcilable and can, in fact, have the same meaning.

While physics has been remarkably successful in describing the material world, from the smallest scales of particle physics to the largest scales of cosmology, it currently makes no reference to consciousness and associated mental or spiritual experiences.  \n\nIndeed, most physicists adopt a materialist and reductionist view in which consciousness is just an incidental by-product of the brain. However, many arguments from physics itself suggest that consciousness is a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the Universe, so it is natural to extend physics to accommodate it. This is especially true if one believes in certain anomalous interactions between consciousness and the physical world. However, this will require a radically different physical paradigm from the one that currently prevails.\n\nBernard Carr is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at Queen Mary University of London. His professional area of research is cosmology and relativistic astrophysics and includes such topics as the early universe, black holes, dark matter, and the anthropic principle. His recent books are Universe or Multiverse? (2007) and Quantum Black Holes (2014). He believes that physics must expand to accommodate consciousness and mental phenomena. Professor Carr is President of the Scientific and Medical Network and former president of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\n#consciousness #science #physics\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HmahihKTjE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HmahihKTjE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HmahihKTjE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HmahihKTjE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HmahihKTjE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":307,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9HmahihKTjE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mvuuhaU5d4X0oNwYy3SUAib5Gv0","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmVxQjBuVjF3TEUw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-25T00:00:07Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Planet Nine Hypothesis","description":"Particle Astrophysicist and Fermilab Scientist Dr. William Wester Explains the Planet Nine Hypothesis\n\nWatch the full lecture, “The Search for Planet Nine in Our Solar System” here: https://youtu.be/2mJigXf_hWE","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqB0nV1wLE0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqB0nV1wLE0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqB0nV1wLE0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqB0nV1wLE0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqB0nV1wLE0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":308,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eqB0nV1wLE0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"t1_A7KOP5MuZC5m90NrBja4LSG0","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmo4V1RhczFfRUNJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-22T22:00:08Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Secret Life of Elvis Presley with Gary Tillery | Theosophical Classic 2013","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nThe public Elvis was a conservative Southern Christian, a daily Bible reader raised in the Assembly of God Church.

Often we connect this sense with personal, political, or social issues, but if we look deeper, we realize that there is an inner anxiety that underlies all of these problems.\n\nWhat’s the cause of this anxiety? Richard Smoley suggests that it is spiritual and metaphysical in nature. He will discuss the question of why we think things are wrong in terms of traditions including Theosophy, Gnosticism, A Course in Miracles, and the psychology of C.G. Jung.\n\nRichard Smoley is editor of Quest: Journal of the Theosophical Society in America. He is the author of eleven books on spirituality, philosophy, and religion.

Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it.” Dissolving practices embody this spiritual principle. In Outer Dissolving, the mind's intent is used to release tension and pain from your physical and etheric (qi) bodies. Deeper Inner Dissolving can free blockages in the higher energy bodies (emotional, mental, psychic, karmic), and results in what the Taoists call “Relaxing Into Your ‘Being’” – the heart-mind (hsin), or, soul.\n\nDon Myers has over 30 years of experience as a student of Taoism and practitioner of tai chi, qigong and neigong, and has taught for 25 years.\n\nWatch the full presentation here: https://youtu.be/6nlOXcOLka0\n\n#TaoTeChing #Taoism #LauTzu","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X9_oejABR0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X9_oejABR0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X9_oejABR0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X9_oejABR0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X9_oejABR0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":313,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6X9_oejABR0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"kNl6XUf9f4I2RZW2_MDqdeaYBGQ","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlEwQ0pyZ2VrOE5R","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-10T16:27:20Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The Buddha’s Advice for the Open-Minded Seeker | John Cianciosi","description":"\"At a time when we are confronted with conflicting ideas, views, opinions, beliefs, and “facts” about so much in life – including spirituality – it can easily lead to a sense of confusion, bewilderment, and frustration. This can result in a sense of indifference and loss of purpose or guiding principal in how we approach life. The Buddha addresses this very problem in one of his famous discourses, the Kalama Sutta which has at times been referred to as “The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry.” In this discourse, the Buddha provides very useful guidance on how to evaluate diversity and the often-conflicting sources of information in order to ascertain what is worth following and implementing in one’s life. Although this discourse was given over two thousand years ago, it remains incredibly relevant to our current situation. In this lecture, John Cianciosi will explore the Buddha’s advice for the open-minded seeker.\n\nJohn Cianciosi was born in Italy and educated in Australia. In 1972, he was ordained a Buddhist monk in Thailand and trained under one of that country’s most gifted and influential meditation masters, the late Venerable Ajahn Chah. While living in remote jungle monasteries, he led a disciplined, celibate life devoted to the practice of mental cultivation. This unique experience fostered his profound appreciation for the meditative path. Later, he was appointed abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat, the International Forest Monastery established to provide training for the growing number of Ajahn Chah’s Western disciples. In 1982, he was asked to establish a Buddhist monastery in Perth, Western Australia. For the next 14 years, he was instrumental in successfully establishing Bodhinyana Monastery and Dhammaloka Buddhist Centre. As abbot and spiritual director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia, Cianciosi was responsible for the training of monks and teaching in the lay community.\n\n#Buddhism #Buddha #Meditation\"\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0CJrgek8NQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0CJrgek8NQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0CJrgek8NQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0CJrgek8NQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q0CJrgek8NQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":314,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Q0CJrgek8NQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"KgvVCeJrkDEkVX19qJRLBwEF41E","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLi1RSUJXUGVsS2xz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-08-08T22:00:01Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Kandinsky, Spiritual Insight, and Abstract Art with Dan Noga | Theosophical Classic 2010","description":"This video is part of the Theosophical Society in America’s Classics Series.\n\nWassily Kandinsky, a major figure in abstract art, was deeply influenced by Theosophy.

Hilma’s work predates that of Kandinsky and others, and is no less stunning. Influenced by the teachings of Theosophy, her work is a visual representation of a complex view into the spiritual realm. Misunderstood and all but forgotten, this amazing artist and mystic has now been rediscovered almost 100 years later.\n\nFilmmaker Halina Dyrschka brought Hilma af Klint, her art, and her story to life in her recently released documentary “Beyond the Visible – Hilma af Klint,” earning praise from New York Times critic A.O. Scott, who said the film “bristles with the excitement of discovery and also with the impatience that recognition has taken so long. It refreshes the eyes and the mind.”\n\nDirector Halina Dyrschka and Theosophical Society in America President Barbara Hebert, Ph.D., discuss the spiritual aspects of Hilma’s life and work, exploring the artist’s life as a trailblazer and spiritual seeker.\n\n#hilmaafklint #theosophy #spiritualart","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9gqpHzkSbTE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9gqpHzkSbTE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9gqpHzkSbTE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9gqpHzkSbTE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9gqpHzkSbTE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":323,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9gqpHzkSbTE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"SmTKVPesUonKeS4_Nfq5kAqWeVA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjcwOUtfX3V0RktB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-07-07T00:00:02Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Wisdom from The Bhagavad Gita for Dealing with Actions Beyond Your Control","description":"The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred text that teaches us that human nature does not change; it is only our circumstances that continue to change.

In The Secret Doctrine, H. P. Blavatsky states that primitive astrology was as far above modern astrology as the zodiacal signs are above the lamp-posts. Eduardo Javier Gramaglia will explore astrology’s links to the Laws of Karma and examine some of the enigmatic hints and assertions about astrology found in the Secret Doctrine in an attempt to find out where this ancient science fits into esoteric knowledge. Presented on June 10, 2021.\n\nEduardo Javier Gramaglia holds a degree in classical philology from National University. He gives seminars, workshops, and lectures on a wide range of Theosophical subjects. His main area of research is the late Hellenistic tradition, particularly its hermetic texts on mystery traditions and astrology. He published Hermetic Astrology in 2006, the first book in Spanish on the ancient astrological traditions. He has taken part in international conventions, given seminars, and published two English translations of Ancient Greek astrological manuals. Eduardo teaches Ancient Religion and Myth, as well as Sanskrit language and literature at National University.

Called by many different names throughout history, the spirit of wetiko—a form of psychic blindness—renders every other issue secondary, for wetiko is the over-arching umbrella that contains, subsumes, informs, and underlies every form of self-and-other destruction that our species is acting out in our world on every scale. Wetiko only has power over us, however, to the extent it is not seen. Paul Levy will illumine how wetiko operates openly in the world and covertly within our own minds, and how we can begin to heal from this pernicious plague that afflicts humanity.\n\nA pioneer in the field of spiritual emergence, Paul Levy is a wounded healer in private practice, helping others who are also awakening to the dreamlike nature of reality. He is the author of Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil (2013), The Quantum Revelation: A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality (2018), and more. A Tibetan Buddhist practitioner for over 30 years, he has intimately studied with some of the greatest spiritual masters of Tibet and Burma. Paul was also the coordinator of the Portland chapter of the Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for over twenty years.

The text has been attributed to Adi Shankaracharya, who is renowned for his role in resurrecting and reestablishing the Vedic tradition in India. Shankara and his disciples have played a pivotal role in reviving the study of Advaita Vedanta as unfolded in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and other related texts.\nVedanta is a direct means of knowledge that unfolds the vision of truth. The Vivekachudamani extols the essence of Advaita Vedanta in 581 verses. In this series, Janani Cleary will present a distillation of these verses, categorized into four major topics that provide an overview of the essential aspects of the study. Join us for an exploration of this profound, inspiring text.\nTopics include: the qualifications of a fit student; the nature of the individual, the world, and the higher power; how liberation is accomplished; and how meditation factors into gaining this knowledge.\nCourse Outline:\n1. What Are the Qualifications of a Fit Student? To be successful in any undertaking, it is ultimately all about attitude. The selected verses unfold how to prepare the mind for the study of Advaita Vedanta. In the process, students will be able to determine whether they need to make an attitude adjustment and if so, what, why, and how.\n2. Continuation of Part 1.\n3. What Is the Nature of the Individual, the World, and the Higher Power? Sometimes we realize we may have lost perspective on the genuine reality of a situation. When our perspective is not objective, this can potentially do us harm. In this context, knowing the difference between what is real and what is otherwise is crucial to discovering the Ultimate Truth.  Without this recognition all seeking is useless.\n4. What Is Liberation, How Is It Accomplished, and How Does It Relate to the Seeker? This topic is self-explanatory, yet still very much misunderstood. If we are intent upon liberation, it behooves us to know the answers to all of these questions.\n5. What is Meditation, How Is It Done, and How Does It Factor into Gaining This Knowledge? Again, the answers to these questions are self-evident but still not generally understood. Yet meditation serves as a key component in “gaining” liberation, so it is critical to grasp it fully and practice it effectively.\" Presented on April 16, 2019. 1 of 5.\n\nJanani Cleary began her pursuit in Vedanta as a yoga teacher in New York City. She then completed an intensive course in India to obtain her teaching certification and has shared knowledge and insights with students for several decades. She has been engaged with various Vedic cultural centers and other venues across the country, including participation in a White House conference. She also served as an advisor to the movie Gurukulam (2016), a documentary on what it is like to be a student in an ashram.

Karim. Dr. Karim’s breakthrough research identified a harmonizing subtle energy quality found in sacred power spots that can be detected through three energy qualities referred to as BG3. The BG3 quality is at the core of harmonic relationships of energy and shape in nature. BioGeometry uses the energy principles of shapes to balance biological energy systems within the overall framework of environmental energy interactions. It encompasses the universal laws and natural dynamics affecting living energy systems, which have been largely ignored in our modern civilization at the expense of our health and well-being. Ultimately, BioGeometry is a promising solution to restore life force in modern environments. Premiered on May 27, 2021.\n\nDr. Ibrahim Karim is an architect and regional planner. He is a graduate of the prestigious Federal Institute (ETH) of Zurich, Switzerland, and holds a BA/MA and PhD/D.Sc. in Tourist Planning. Dr. Karim is the founder of the qualitative science of BioGeometry and currently teaches at several universities and supervises numerous postgraduate studies on the applications of the science of BioGeometry. He was chosen as man of the year by the Swiss magazine Anzeiger in 2005 for his success in reducing the effect of “electro smog” in several regions in Switzerland. Dr. Karim was also chosen as one of the 100 most innovative designers of the 20th Century on Swedish TV, and in 2018 was awarded the Amelia B.

Over time, they revealed to her that the purpose of her NDE was to teach and remind people of the importance of connection. True connection can only be achieved through unconditional love, yet many people don’t know how to clear blockages to get there. If our essence is that of universal love, peace and joy, then the true question is: What am I doing to disturb it? Learn how to realize your full potential and fulfill your dreams without the need of an NDE. Discover how our challenges can turn into a conscious doorway to awareness, awakening, and evolution. Attaining loving awareness is the gift we are giving to ourselves, and, therefore, to humanity. Premiered on May 20, 2021.\n\nIngrid Honkala, Ph.D. was born in Bogota, Colombia, where she grew up with her parents and three sisters. From the moment of her NDE at the age of two, Ingrid was aware of other dimensions of life than those most of us normally experience. She was also gifted with the wise input of Beings of Light, who gave her invaluable insights and assistance as she faced the challenges of growing up and finding her professional destiny as an oceanographer and now as a giver of light. Throughout her life’s journey from her native Colombia to Europe and her eventual home in the USA — and from a deadly war zone to underwater explorations at a NASA research center — Ingrid shares how any human experience can be illumined from within when we are in alignment with inner-guidance. In her autobiography, A Brightly Guided Life: How a Scientist Learned to Hear her Inner Wisdom, Ingrid details her amazing journey with the Beings of Light.

When God is viewed as a protective parental figure who can shield us from harm if we are pious or devoted enough, what happens to faith – and healing – when this form of god fails to provide that protection? How can we help friends and family who experience cognitive dissonance when their religious beliefs – whether inherited or chosen – do not match up with their lived experience? This presentation examines the ways in which religious beliefs can be more harmful than helpful for traumatized or bereaved individuals. We will explore therapeutic tools and healing practices for helping someone in spiritual crisis to consider new cosmologies and new images of God that are more supportive and inclusive than those found in traditional religious structures. Presented on May 13, 2021.\n\nDr. Terri Daniel, CT, CCTP, is a hospice and hospital-trained clinical chaplain (interfaith).

P. Blavatsky dictated a Diagram of Meditation to one of her close students, meant to help us realize our spiritual identity. The Diagram offers a comprehensible approach that is not limited to instructions for sitting meditation, but also includes a set of attitudes to be observed during daily life.\n\nIn this workshop, Pablo Sender explored the theory and practice of the following exercises proposed by Blavatsky in her Diagram of Meditation.\n\nPablo Sender, Ph.D., became a member of the Theosophical Society in his native Argentina and has presented Theosophical lectures, seminars, and classes around the world.

The division is between those who believe that consciousness is primary to matter, and those who look upon it as a result of the complexity of brain matter. Macrocosmic Quantum Theory demonstrates that the evolution of consciousness is brought by nine sequentially activated waves of creation – what the ancients referred to as Plumed Serpents – that shape evolution in all its forms. From this perspective, the purpose of human life seems to be to attain the state of consciousness of the Ninth Wave. Join us for a discussion on the paths to get there. Presented on April 1, 2021.\n\nCarl Johan Calleman has a Ph.D. in physical biology from the University of Stockholm. He started his career as a senior researcher at the School of Public Health at the University of Washington in Seattle, focusing on identifying toxic substances in the human environment. After leaving his academic career, he has spent the past 25 years developing an understanding of the meaning of the Mayan calendar, and as part of this quest he has lectured in 25 countries and written seven books, which have been translated to 14 languages. His current focus is on the application of Macrocosmic Quantum Theory.

This state of absorption is described as universal unconsciousness. When the human monad emerges, acquiring or manifesting its Mental Principle (Manas), it experiences consciousness of the Self or Ego. But what comes next? What is the end-game of human existence? To answer this question, we’ll follow the Monad’s journey as outlined in Helena P. Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine. We’ll see that once Manas is active in us, it becomes by necessity dual - Higher and Lower Mind - another mystery, as at times we seem lost in a world where duality reigns. Lastly, we’ll find in the mystical little book, The Voice of the Silence, how Theosophy puts all this together, showing the road that leads to the Path of Illumination.\n\nSign up today for free spiritual resources, new programs, and more! https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/j6HRSIr/social\n\n#Theosophy\n#spirituality\n#spiritualawakening\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAlYmmbk8Vo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAlYmmbk8Vo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAlYmmbk8Vo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAlYmmbk8Vo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAlYmmbk8Vo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":376,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bAlYmmbk8Vo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"riAsx09JVnbq1J1Zkxspa10XvJE","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjM4Ym9pY3Y2eXk4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-18T20:17:02Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Barbara Hebert - The President's Blog: February 2021","description":"The president of the American Section of the Theosophical Society shares the latest news from Olcott.\n\nSign up today for free spiritual resources, new programs, and more! https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/j6HRSIr/social\n\n#theosophy\n#spirituality\n#spiritualawakening\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38boicv6yy8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38boicv6yy8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38boicv6yy8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38boicv6yy8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/38boicv6yy8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":377,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"38boicv6yy8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"OMccFtKwDuyop-wKWoeMNliq2zw","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjRYQzFuVVgzRTRZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-02-12T01:00:15Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Bhikkhu Bodhi - Living the Best Life: The Buddha’s Answers to Life’s Urgent Questions","description":"The ancient Buddhist scriptures contain a dialogue between the Buddha and a yaksha, a demonic being, in which the yaksha asks the Buddha four riddles that touch on our most urgent concerns: What is the best treasure for a person in this world?

Even in the spiritual realm, the histories of religions and all attempts at creating spiritual vehicles to foster such high ideals as harmony, unity, love, and compassion inevitably all resulted in some form of division, outright conflict, and even violence. Often such divisions begin even during the spiritual founder’s own lifetime. It seems that even spiritual communities cannot live in total peace and harmony. Is this true? What is it that prevents us from reaching our highest ideals, and what can we do about it? This may be the season of peace and goodwill, but it is still a challenge for us to make it so.

This sacred text teaches us that human nature does not change; it is only our circumstances that continue to change. In this lecture, we will dissect the story of protagonist Arjuna’s inability to escape a fratricidal war until Lord Krishna teaches him to adjust his attitude, mental wherewithal, and spiritual vision in order to finally succeed. The lessons learned in these passages can provide as much clarity and help in overcoming our current struggles as they did thousands of years ago.

To accomplish this, the spiritual element needs a body-mind – often simply called flesh or body. Spirit without body is lame, as body without spirit is blind. We all spend much of our time and energy in ordinary life or daily activities. This is so even in monasteries, where each aspiring monk must engage in ordinary life activities of eating, sleeping, and cleaning. This meditation is designed to help us, both in our spiritual development and in coping with our daily activities.

These times can be initiated by something external to us such as the death of a loved one, a pandemic, or a natural disaster. Times of darkness can also originate internally, brought about through life events like experiencing a milestone birthday, or feeling that life has lost its meaning. These experiences, whether externally or internally initiated, can leave us suffering intense pain as well as feeling overwhelmed and lost. However, it is possible to reach toward enlightenment during times of darkness, thus alleviating these feelings. In this talk, we will explore, not only times of darkness, but enlightenment, its meaning, how we may strive toward it.

We know consciousness continues after the body dies, and we, as a culture, have been intellectually and spiritually elevated by learning about these life-altering experiences. So what's next? How do we teach and support a metaphysical understanding of birth, death, and beyond? In this thought-provoking and research-rich presentation, Terri discusses our role as “sacred activists,” and invites us to explore the ways in which we can serve as teachers and advocates for death awareness and consciousness studies in the decades to come.

The Rare Earth Hypothesis uses the Goldilocks principle in the argument that temperatures must be 'just right' for intelligent life to develop on a planetary system. Of the billions of planets in our Milky Way galaxy, millions fall into this category of being not too hot and not too cold. But at a deeper level, there are many other fundamental physics parameters, such as the masses of the elementary particles and the forces between them, the rate of expansion of the universe, and so on that must also be finely tuned for life to thrive. If our universe is truly alone in the vast scheme of things, it seems to imply that all these conditions were purposefully designed. However, if we really live in a Multiverse – meaning our universe is only one of a vast number, all with different physical parameters, then the Goldilocks Principle must apply at a deeper level. This lecture will explore the physics that has to be ‘just right’ and describe some ideas about a Multiverse.

Familiar patterns include The Hero, The Inner Child, The Leader, The Teacher, The Savior, The Warrior, The Adventurer, The Lover, The Caregiver, The Inventor, and The Magician. When these archetypes are in balance, they function as guides, helping us become our best selves; however, when one archetype is dominant, it can become tyrannical, even destructive, to ourselves and others. In this experiential presentation, you will identify and de-code the archetypes you live by and assess whether they are trustworthy guides or out-of-control tyrants! The journey will be different for everyone, but the goal of achieving a healthier, happier Self will be the same!

We often say we have an “enlightened attitude” towards a social norm, which may mean being more progressive or advanced in the way we approach life. In spiritual circles, it tends to refer to some form of exalted spiritual experience or achievement of great significance. In Buddhism, it is presented as the culmination and completion of the spiritual quest with nothing more to be done. Enlightenment is seen as a radically transformative experience that completely frees the mind from all ignorance. We will explore what the Buddha said about this experience and what it means for us.

Why is there so much suffering? What is its cause? Why do good people suffer? Can we put an end to sorrow? These and other related questions have been asked throughout human history, and religions and philosophies have tried to answer them from various perspectives. The Theosophical tradition has an evolutionary outlook in which opposites such as good and evil, pleasure and pain, and life and death are all working for a divine purpose.

This Dark Night of the Soul is an inescapable event when walking the spiritual path. When strong, it leads to the feeling that God has abandoned us. Yet in truth, it is a darkness that emerges before the soul’s dawning hour. In this presentation, William Meader will show how spiritual blindness is a prelude to greater light, as well as the processes that can be used to lift the “veils of illusion” that give rise to this blindness.

While it is perfectly normal to feel this way, with effort we can cultivate a healthier and more productive response. Buddhism teaches us that anxiety and worry are negative emotions that hinder our ability to live responsible and caring lives. That a human being can be free of such negative emotions is central to the Buddha’s teaching. However, only when we clearly understand the nature of the human condition, and come to terms with this reality, can we begin to free ourselves. This is our potential and our challenge.

His fierce, clear, wild, ecstatic songs provide exquisite spiritual illumination coupled with a grounding relevance to our troubled times. Turn Me to Gold, the title of Andrew Harvey’s newest book, is taken from a line by Kabir that just one drop of divine love can turn you to gold. To be “gold” is to be fully embodied—experiencing God not only in the mind, but also in the body, in the cells. Our planet is trying to birth a new consciousness of the Divine, insists Harvey, not only from those who are becoming conscious of it, but those who have integrated and embodied it as well. Kabir, then, is the supreme guide for allowing ourselves to be “turned to gold.” Presented on September 19, 2019.\n\n\n*****************************\nLearn more\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3771\n\nBooks:\nTurn Me to Gold: 108 Poems of Kabir - https://amzn.to/3hSslVH #AmazonAssociate\nThe Tibetan Book - https://amzn.to/31MwxAJ #AmazonAssociate\nThe Hope - https://amzn.to/3gR6cG6 #AmazonAssociate\nThe Direct Path - https://amzn.to/3hTgwi3 #AmazonAssociate\nSon of Man - https://amzn.to/2EVqyk6 #AmazonAssociate \n*****************************\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrqyLLd38e8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrqyLLd38e8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrqyLLd38e8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrqyLLd38e8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrqyLLd38e8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":495,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SrqyLLd38e8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ITFMFdNxChV2E9InkveJPUBeN6o","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkhXd1ZWTENiZDJr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-09-17T18:16:25Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Barbara Hebert - The President's Blog: September 2019","description":"Presented on September 7, 2019\n\nThe president of the American Section of the Theosophical Society shares the latest news from Olcott.\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWwVVLCbd2k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWwVVLCbd2k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWwVVLCbd2k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWwVVLCbd2k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWwVVLCbd2k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":496,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"HWwVVLCbd2k"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"6_2h2q-WQKcQKmFetQad8qsUk8Q","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLm1NcFZ0Umxpckln","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-08-07T18:48:05Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Barbara Hebert - The President's Blog: August 2019","description":"The president of the American Section of the Theosophical Society shares the latest news from Olcott.\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpVtRlirIg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpVtRlirIg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpVtRlirIg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpVtRlirIg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpVtRlirIg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":497,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"mMpVtRlirIg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ubbSjUwg8gRP6pkfTouJPkNAPyQ","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLlhaWl9hTGNuOEpr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-08-07T18:45:26Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Ajahn Brahm - Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond: Renowned Buddhist Monk Shares Wit and Wisdom","description":"Presented on June 19, 2019\n\nJoin us for a unique opportunity to meet and hear the internationally acclaimed Buddhist teacher and meditation master Ajahn Brahm.

The theory of evolution of humanity through \"Root-Races\" offered in the SD has often been misinterpreted outside Theosophical circles.

Among its most important teachings are the principles of the oneness of all life and the full realization of that oneness which is the purpose of the human journey. These are truths that can set us free from the causes of suffering and misery to bring us to perfect peace and fulfillment. What are the implications of these key teachings of the occult philosophy, which, according to HP Blavatsky, is the science of life, the art of living?

In working with over 30,000 trauma survivors, Brent Baum has valuable insights into how we can learn to focus, maintain safety, release the “stuck moments” and feelings of the past, and return to living optimally in the present moment. Through discourses in energy and somatic and color psychology, we have learned to target and address the specific moments where consciousness is frozen and speak the language of love and safety necessary to release us from the binds of these pain states. Learn how the emotional reframing of our past experiences stops our fight-flight-freeze stress response and gives us the best chance of strengthening our immune systems and healing memory-based pain.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3724&search=Energy%2C+Color&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VYvMZEJMEsY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VYvMZEJMEsY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VYvMZEJMEsY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":509,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"VYvMZEJMEsY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Kg5W8up615fVRNXnJ3xPbvD58pw","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnFTYWM1VTFxd1l3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-06-03T01:32:15Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Leslie Sann: Choosing Joyful Living","description":"Presented on May 30, 2019\n\nAssociated handout available at: https://lesliesann.com/go-joy-yourself/\n\nFor additional resources please write to Leslie at: leslie@lesliesann.com\n\nJoy is a sign of optimal health and wellbeing. Joyful people think differently. They are more inventive, resilient, patient, generous, optimistic, and kind. They focus more on what IS working rather than what is not, fostering gratitude and even more joy. In joy there is ease. In ease there is power.

Harvey: Treating Pain through the Mind-Body-Heart Connection","description":"Presented on may 16, 2019\n\nWhile pain of any kind can be debilitating and life altering if left untreated, it can also be used to indicate root health problems. Treating these root issues can lead to deep healing beyond simply erasing the immediate pain. Acupuncturist Peter Harvey will offer practical insight as to how pain is viewed and treated using traditional Chinese medical techniques and will discuss some of the modern-day parallels in treatments available without the use of drugs or surgery. Through Chinese medicine teachings, Peter will demonstrate how the mind, body, and spirit are one and how disturbances in shen, the spirit of the heart, can affect your health. By learning to treat the root cause of your pain rather than the pain itself, you can experience deep healing of the body, mind, and spirit.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3715&search=Treating+Pain+through&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEqjtg12RYM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEqjtg12RYM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEqjtg12RYM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEqjtg12RYM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEqjtg12RYM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":528,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"IEqjtg12RYM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"CCieD1i9f8amvD9rcy-yQjeXpD8","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkg4VFkxYS0wa2Rn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-05-16T17:49:50Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Cynthia Wright - The Medicine Wheel: Finding Peace and Balance","description":"Presented on May 9, 2019.\n\nThe Medicine Wheel has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for health and healing.

Sometimes it’s called the Ancient Wisdom or the perennial philosophy. It’s reflected in traditions such as Theosophy, the Kabbalah, esoteric Christianity, Hermeticism, Sufism, and many others. It is discussed in many books, but it still often seems hard to pin down what, exactly, it is. Why are these teachings secret? What makes them so? If they’re secret, how can we say anything about them at all? Where can one find them? Richard Smoley will explore this line of knowledge, and clarify many common errors and fallacies about it.

Around the world, spiritually minded people are responding to The Call to transform the human condition. Such people are change agents in support of the Soul of Humanity and its evolution. Yet, at times, various internal obstacles hinder them from truly rising to their soul’s calling. William Meader will examine the nature of The Call as it manifests within human consciousness and will discuss how the personality (lower-self) tends to block the soul’s intention and what can be done to overcome this tendency.

The Bardo Thodol teaches that once awareness is freed from the body, it creates its own reality as one would experience in a dream. This dream occurs in various phases (bardos) in ways both wonderful and terrifying. Overwhelming peaceful and wrathful visions and deities appear. Since the deceased's awareness is in confusion, it needs help and guidance in order for enlightenment and liberation to occur. The Bardo Thodol acts as the guide that helps the individual recognize the true nature of mind and thus attain Nirvana – liberation from the cycle of rebirth. This lecture will draw from two of Lama Glenn's books: Living in the Face of Death: The Tibetan Tradition, and The Tibetan Book of the Dead: An Illustrated Edition.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3666&search=Bardo&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1rAjElcwD18/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1rAjElcwD18/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1rAjElcwD18/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1rAjElcwD18/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1rAjElcwD18/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":544,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"1rAjElcwD18"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Pin4sTQOlOKI3AeSGcSV3WIH4no","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjRlUmRUSlVZMXZz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-02-13T12:38:20Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Barbara Hebert - The President's Blog: February 2019","description":"The president of the American Section of the Theosophical Society shares the latest news from Olcott.\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eRdTJUY1vs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eRdTJUY1vs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eRdTJUY1vs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eRdTJUY1vs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4eRdTJUY1vs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":545,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4eRdTJUY1vs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"AnPlSz_qmoABq2iMkXP7F4cTgBA","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLmpCV2daX09qODh3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-02-13T12:33:55Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Azam Nizamuddin: Cultivating Emotional Intelligence","description":"Presented on February 7, 2019\n\nEmotional Intelligence is the ability to sense, understand, and effectively apply the power and acumen of emotions as a source of energy, information, creativity, trust, and connection.

Quantum mechanics stated that elementary systems only have real definite local properties if and when observed by a conscious observer. This squares well with early Buddhism's idea of Emptiness (Sunnata) and emphasis on Experience as the sole reality. Special relativity introduced length-contraction and time-dilation similar to Buddhism's concept of seeing all states as conditional relations (Patthana) between mind and its object, thus also renouncing the naive idea of local reality existing independent of the observing mind. Join Buddhist monk and scientist Bhante Samahita for a discussion on the convergence of Buddhism, quantum physics, and relativity.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3651&search=Samahita&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCMaz9d38Oo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCMaz9d38Oo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCMaz9d38Oo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCMaz9d38Oo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCMaz9d38Oo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":548,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"UCMaz9d38Oo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"QB7SUnzg93LlMOPWQGoMVX0EhXE","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjUzemJmYWJjSU1F","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-01-09T22:12:25Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Ray Grasse: Astrology and the Great Ages","description":"Presented on December 13, 2018\n\nWhen does a \"Great Age\" truly begin, and how can we best unlock the meaning of the different Ages?

Shamans provide healing and insight to their communities by journeying to other realms and contacting the spirits and forces there. They encounter animal powers, deities, and the spirits of ancestors as a way of gaining wisdom. Over the past few decades, Westerners have been discovering the way of the shaman and practicing it themselves. Is shamanism possible for us today? Does it work, and what promises does it hold out? In this engaging presentation, Richard Smoley will address these questions and will lead participants on a guided meditation to gain a taste of this tradition for themselves.

The untrained, unobserved mind is more dangerous than a weapon. The stories we create, the drama we fall into, and the decisions and choices we make when we're not centered and calm can create mental and emotional damage that feels insurmountable. Bhante Sujatha will share his personal experience dealing with anger as a young man – a character trait not suitable for a Buddhist monk! – and teach us how to observe the mind and emotions and use the data from that inner observation to transform our thought patterns. The result is a life in which crazy thoughts and emotional highs and lows aren't gone, but are understood and used as guideposts to help us find our center again; which leads to a life of joy.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3621&search=Sujatha&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCOI_TrSHGk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCOI_TrSHGk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCOI_TrSHGk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCOI_TrSHGk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCOI_TrSHGk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":561,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QCOI_TrSHGk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Vo-APlCtoWgGFge-bD1BncgeFn0","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnRCM1RYeDRWRWU4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-10-22T05:47:57Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Kurt Leland - Inner Life Safari: The Tour","description":"During his 50 years of membership in the Theosophical Society, Charles Webster Leadbeater (1854–1934) produced dozens of books, pamphlets, and articles on our inner spiritual life as he perceived it by means of clairvoyance. He examined everything from higher planes to physical planets, great angels to tiny atoms, and the high mass to the lowly handshake to determine their effects on various levels of our being. How do we assess this information? Is it still relevant to us today? How can we understand or adapt it to our daily lives? On this light-hearted journey through Leadbeater’s writings, Kurt Leland will show us how to map our own inner life safari.

For all who feel overworked and overwhelmed, there are ways to pause periodically and still be productive. Our lives today plead for greater balance. Balance as a goal dates back to the ancient contemplative tradition in the Christian church. Looking to ancient monastic contemplative practices, and some modern-day ones as well, we will explore practical ways to slow down and seek greater balance to give the mind a chance to reboot and recharge.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3612&search=Valente&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UluJN-6cc68/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UluJN-6cc68/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UluJN-6cc68/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UluJN-6cc68/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UluJN-6cc68/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":564,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"UluJN-6cc68"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"8GEddt4KJyVBgtf-elYJFBxpiHY","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnVpZTdQMGU1dGd3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-09-22T03:11:53Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"John Cianciosi - Buddha-Dharma: The Marriage of Wisdom and Compassion","description":"In our Western culture, we often associate feelings such as compassion and love as coming from the heart and relegate intellect and knowledge to the brain or mind. Thus, we set up a disconnect between emotions and intellect. However, in Buddhism, wisdom and compassion are qualities that mutually support each other. The Buddha did not suggest that we choose one over the other, but wanted us to cultivate the Eight-fold Path that leads to the perfection of both. A mind that is freed from ignorance is the same thing as a heart that is filled with compassion.

This holy longing is a secret feeling with many disguises, leading us to pursue a higher union in spiritual practice, religious discipleship, even romantic embrace. It guides us to timeless wisdom and transcendent experiences. But it also can go awry if we misplace it onto food, alcohol, drugs, or sex. Or if we project it onto an authoritarian teacher, priest, guru, or roshi who abuses power. Thereby, we encounter darkness on the path. Many renowned teachers, past and present, have labored under these projections—and acted out their shadows in destructive ways, leaving their followers traumatized and lost. Whether the abuse is sexual, financial, or emotional coercion, we feel the shock of betrayal, our innocence is lost, and our faith is shaken. The resulting spiritual disillusionment, Dr. Zweig suggests, does not take us off the path, but is a crucial part of the spiritual journey and can lead us through the narrow gate back toward the light.

So, unknowingly, we banish those qualities that don’t fit the image into a dark cavern of the mind. Then, like Dorian’s painting, these qualities take on a life of their own, which appears abruptly like an unwanted stranger—a critic, an addict, a victim, a tyrant, a liar, a cheater. This stranger, known as the shadow, is us, yet is not us. We are invited to explore the shadow as a mystery, not as a problem to be solved. When the “other” arrives from the dark side, if we honor that part of ourselves as a guest we will discover that it comes bearing gifts. Each shadow character began with a purpose, carrying a valid need. It can erupt and sabotage our adult life, wreaking havoc on self-esteem, loving relationships, and meaningful goals. But when we learn to “romance” it, or create a conscious relationship to a shadow that was previously unconscious, we cultivate a deeper self-knowledge and learn to live a more authentic life.

The premise normally assumed is that \"good\" is natural, while evil is a perversion of the natural. Theosophical literature presents an alternative picture in which spirit and matter, positive and negative, good and evil, are twin aspects of the One Reality. This more organic view of the cosmos acknowledges that both light and darkness play a role in the evolution of consciousness, allowing us to understand better how to relate to life and all its complexities.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3581&search=Light+and+Darkness&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m5bcR0CmtU4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m5bcR0CmtU4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m5bcR0CmtU4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m5bcR0CmtU4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m5bcR0CmtU4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":583,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"m5bcR0CmtU4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"i_p0EIsgDsw0C2o4ioJqQ9QWWXg","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkh4NzJNUm1RM3p3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-07-09T16:28:28Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"The President's Blog: July 2018","description":"The president of the American Section of the Theosophical Society shares the latest news from Olcott.\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hx72MRmQ3zw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hx72MRmQ3zw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hx72MRmQ3zw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hx72MRmQ3zw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hx72MRmQ3zw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":584,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Hx72MRmQ3zw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"JVgaL9JPBbyVJoxWC8yDqsqrSHM","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLnZ4cjRPY1h5YXhn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-07-09T10:10:37Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Ajahn Chandako: The Law of Karma","description":"Presented on June 28, 2018\n\nTeachings on karma are often confused with ideas such as fatalism and the notion that everything is predetermined. However, the Buddha was very careful to refute such misconceptions. Rather, he spoke about karma as a dynamic process of cause and effect governed by impersonal natural laws, by which our volitional actions generate consequences. Within this framework, we discover that we have both the freedom and the responsibility of shaping destiny.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: https://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3564&search=Law+of+Karma&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxr4OcXyaxg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxr4OcXyaxg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxr4OcXyaxg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxr4OcXyaxg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxr4OcXyaxg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":585,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vxr4OcXyaxg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"gVPrjmxBnHiMgaSpvzN4eu7z6Ro","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLkhhRnVKcjBJRTVr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-29T03:32:12Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Neal Grossman - Science and Spirituality: When Facts and Faith Unite","description":"Presented on June 21, 2018\n\nScience and spirituality are often believed to be fundamentally opposed to one another, yet the application of scientific methodology to the study of spiritual experience has led to striking validation of the latter.

This talk explores Rumi's theology of love not only as a feeling, but an attitude and orientation that defines the very essence of righteousness and true religion.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: http://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3507&search=Rumi%27s+Poetic+Theology+of+Love&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true\n\nThe views expressed in this program are those of the presenter/s and do not necessarily represent the views of the Theosophical Society in America, its members or its affiliates.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo2qkyVZtjg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo2qkyVZtjg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo2qkyVZtjg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo2qkyVZtjg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo2qkyVZtjg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":607,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"oo2qkyVZtjg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"rgpoXTaFoLMor9Lo7sz4XgQqCdQ","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLk9pUTBwclo5UjBR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-02-22T14:49:53Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Marilyn Mitchell - Vibrational Medicine: Energy Healing for Reversing Health Disorders","description":"Presented on February 15, 2018\n\nThis presentation offers a discussion of the use of energy healing in serious medical situations and other conditions, including an explanation of how energy healing works.

They have been the source of endless commentary and inspiration in Zen since at least the 12th century. These ox herding images are emblematic of the spiritual path to enlightenment. Each image represents a phase of the practice, beginning with a seeker looking for the mind, represented by the ox, and trying to realize an enlightened mind. He then searches for the ox, finds it, and struggles with it. He traps it, tames it, and rides away serenely on it, until there is complete emptiness. We will explore the 10 Ox Herding Pictures and discuss how to use them on the path of enlightenment.

With practice, we can learn to use thinking to generate positive and beneficial mental states. However, thinking cannot bring into being radically new realizations. What we call intuition, revelation, or insight arises spontaneously not from thought, but from the silence and stillness of mind. Through study and careful reflection we can prepare the foundation, but for the arising of deep understanding, we need to feel intimately comfortable with the silence from which thought arises.

Born with the gift of clairvoyant sight, Robin will discuss practical steps to achieving a better understanding of our fellow man and what it means to be living in this world we call home, which often leads to a happier existence.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: http://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=3306&search=Demystifying+Clairvoyance&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P2JChnW96Z4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P2JChnW96Z4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P2JChnW96Z4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P2JChnW96Z4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P2JChnW96Z4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":667,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"P2JChnW96Z4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"65jvACVjTL1e23BnNO6O7kqqQDg","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLndGTHFZOHdzUEdv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-08T15:09:16Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Tim Boyd---Theosophy: A Spiritual Legacy for Humanity","description":"Presented on March 2, 2017\n\nIn Theosophical circles, we often tend to look to our past for guidance and inspiration.

We can learn to navigate this stream, befriend emotions, transform thoughts, and ultimately see beyond the turbulence of life. 2015.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: http://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2920&search=A+Taoist+Approach+to+Transform&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia4LeGiMxLA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia4LeGiMxLA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia4LeGiMxLA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia4LeGiMxLA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia4LeGiMxLA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":759,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Ia4LeGiMxLA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"DtPGRknBq9gFUpTp_LG2CVj511s","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLjNYT01fcU9acFRV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-04-29T16:01:46Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Eben Alexander on the Power of Sacred Acoustics","description":"This video was part of a recorded interview of Dr. Eben Alexander, author of the best-selling book, \"Proof of Heaven.\" Results of the interview first appeared, in print form, in the Winter 2015 issue of \"Quest Magazine\" under the title \"Beyond the Brain.\" 5 of 6.\n\n\n*****************************\nLearn more\n\nBooks:\nProof of Heaven -

Miller was vice-president of the Interreligious Engagement Project 21 and Board member at Hands-of-Peace, an organization that brings American, and Palestinian and Israeli teenagers from the Middle East together for a two-week program in the United States.\n\nThis was Professor Miller's last presentation at the Theosophical Society when, only a few days later, on May 4th, 2011, he died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart arrhythmia. He was 73 years old.\n\nAvailable on DVD at: http://questbooks.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=2220&search=Very+Different+Christian&description=true&category_id=59&sub_category=true","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwjWTKPvG5Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwjWTKPvG5Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwjWTKPvG5Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jwjWTKPvG5Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Theosophical Society","playlistId":"UUKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","position":797,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"jwjWTKPvG5Q"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Theosophical Society","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"zjJwlfOacz2hXch1o7n7gKsCAJM","id":"VVVLbjhVWHZjdldXOURxbDJwcFBEdEVRLm9KeWxaV19qZktz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-07-10T21:03:04Z","channelId":"UCKn8UXvcvWW9Dql2ppPDtEQ","title":"Andrew Vidich: Spiritual Resurrection--Becoming Beings of Love and Light","description":"Each one of us must eventually leave this material world to journey onward to the spirit realm.
