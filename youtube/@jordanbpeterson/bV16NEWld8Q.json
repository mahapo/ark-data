Jung had this idea that people's shadows reach all the way down to hell"},{"startMs":78160,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"which is actually a very frightening concept, and what he meant by that is"},{"startMs":82580,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"if you take a look at the impulses that drive you that are actually malevolent, if you can admit to such impulses"},{"startMs":89300,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"that if you basically follow those all the way down to their origin, you can find some very nasty things"},{"startMs":96700,"durationMs":5540,"subtitle":"and what you find down there basically is what allies you with people who've done terrible things"},{"startMs":102240,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"and that's not a very pleasant experience, I would say"},{"startMs":108540,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"although one thing that's worth thinking about is that it is something that can protect you against being very very badly hurt"},{"startMs":117180,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"because one of the things that characterizes people who develop post-traumatic stress disorder"},{"startMs":123420,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"is that they're often naive, and then they encounter something that's really not within their framework of thinking"},{"startMs":129640,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"and it's usually something bad, and because there isn't anything in their philosophy, their way of looking at the world"},{"startMs":135960,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"that has prepared them for that, they end up fragmented and devastated"},{"startMs":140560,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"it's actually protective to you if you can figure out what your full range of capabilities is"},{"startMs":148560,"durationMs":8360,"subtitle":"because that can help you understand other people a lot better, and to be wiser and more careful in your actions"},{"startMs":156920,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"it's also useful, I think, if you want to convince yourself to act properly"},{"startMs":162120,"durationMs":9020,"subtitle":"because if you regard yourself as harmless, which is a big mistake, then nothing you can do is really that bad"},{"startMs":171140,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"right? because you're harmless, after all; but if you understand that you're seriously not harmless"},{"startMs":176200,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"then that can make you a lot more careful with yourself"},{"startMs":180380,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"and I would say that's especially true maybe when you're dealing... when you have kids, and you start dealing with your kids"},{"startMs":186000,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"if you know that... what you're capable of, because you're human"},{"startMs":190160,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"then that can motivate you to be much more careful with what you say and do"},{"startMs":195600,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"and I don't mean cautious, I don't mean timid, I don't mean any of that"},{"startMs":200060,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"I just mean that you wanna keep things pristine between you and your children, let's say"},{"startMs":204540,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"because that way they're on your good side, and you want them on your good side"},{"startMs":209060,"durationMs":7780,"subtitle":"because children who get on their parents' bad side suffer very badly for it, and sometimes it's because they're literally abused"},{"startMs":216840,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"but more often it's because they get, well they get abused, let's say, or neglected, in much more subtle ways"},{"startMs":224200,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"and you're definitely capable of that, I mean, all you have to do is think about the way you've interacted"},{"startMs":230520,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"with someone that you've decided to not like, or maybe someone you genuinely don't like"},{"startMs":235120,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"and that can range from just not paying any attention to them, especially if they're doing something good"},{"startMs":239720,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"to really pursuing them, and making their life miserable, and you can certainly do that with your family members"},{"startMs":245340,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and you can do that with your intimate partners, and you can do that with your friends, and you can do it with yourself"},{"startMs":250160,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"so it's really worth knowing that, so... well..."},{"startMs":256000,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"the Fox thinks he's a royal rule breaker, but he's really just a two-bit thug, and this is where he learns that"},{"startMs":263220,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"so... sorry, I have a new phone, and I'm kind of stupid with it, still"},{"startMs":269520,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"so..."},{"startMs":275200,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"well, hypothetically that would work, probably won't"},{"startMs":280100,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"anyways, the Coachman's got these guys in his grasp now, regardless"},{"startMs":285940,"durationMs":6740,"subtitle":"partly because they're already down this road, and they can't back off, and partly 'cause he also offers them more money than they've seen before"},{"startMs":292680,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"so as bad as they are, they're going to get worse... many of you, I presume, have seen Breaking Bad"},{"startMs":299180,"durationMs":9000,"subtitle":"that's a really good example of the incorporation, at least in part, or maybe the possession by the shadow from a Jungian perspective"},{"startMs":308180,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"right, because you have this ordinary high school teacher who really thinks that he's an axe [?] and his family as well"},{"startMs":314440,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"you know, like your typical persona, roughly speaking, he's just a normal guy"},{"startMs":319380,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"but part of the reason that he's a normal guy is 'cause he actually hasn't been put in abnormal circumstances"},{"startMs":324940,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and then all of a sudden he is, and he has a genuine moral conundrum, right, he's gonna die of lung cancer"},{"startMs":329760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and he has a son who's got a lot of health problems"},{"startMs":334000,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"and he's terrified that he's going to leave his wife and his child behind with nothing"},{"startMs":339140,"durationMs":9660,"subtitle":"and then of course as the story... and so he decides to do something that... temporarily... that he regards as... that he would normally regard as reprehensible"},{"startMs":348800,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"and of course he just gets tangled up in that, but then, as the story unfolds, you see that there's... it's more complicated"},{"startMs":354260,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"because it's not that he was just innocent good guy, and he decided to turn bad, he's also very resentful"},{"startMs":360400,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"and angry, and it's partly because he's a bit of a pushover at the beginning, or maybe more than a bit of a pushover"},{"startMs":365560,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"and also that he didn't really fulfill his own potential, and that, you know"},{"startMs":370080,"durationMs":8140,"subtitle":"he had friends who walked down the entrepreneurial path and maybe they weren't quite fair to him, but whatever"},{"startMs":378220,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"he ends up not very successful as a high school teacher, so he's really angry about that, and so"},{"startMs":383600,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"there's more motivation for him opening up the door to the terrible elements of his personality"},{"startMs":389880,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"than just the fact that he's got good motivations to do so"},{"startMs":393880,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"and that unfolds, so you see the warps and twists in his resentful character"},{"startMs":399760,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"increasingly manifest themselves as he walks down this road to, really, total brutality, and it's quite good"},{"startMs":407720,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"there's a book called \"Ordinary Men\" that's a lot like that"},{"startMs":411900,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"I don't think I've mentioned that to you before, but \"Ordinary Men\" is a book about... it's the best book of its type"},{"startMs":416780,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"maybe it's the only book of its type... it's possible, but it's plotted much like Breaking Bad in some sense"},{"startMs":423740,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"it's a story about these German policemen in the early stages of World War II"},{"startMs":429620,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"and they were guys who were old enough to be raised in Germany really before the Hitlerian propaganda came out in full force"},{"startMs":437900,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"if you were a teenager, say, in the 1930s, you were gonna be pulled right into the propaganda machine"},{"startMs":442200,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and maybe you were part of the Hitler Youth, like you were raised in that, you know"},{"startMs":445920,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"but if you were older, then you were raised before that"},{"startMs":448920,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and you're not as amenable to propaganda once you're older than about, well, I would say, about 22 or something like that"},{"startMs":455880,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"it's pretty young, actually; if you're gonna make a soldier, you have to get a soldier young"},{"startMs":460560,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"'cause once people are in their early twenties, say, they already have their personality developed"},{"startMs":466300,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"anyways, these policemen were sent into Poland after the Germans marched through"},{"startMs":472720,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"and, you know, it was wartime, and there was this hypothesis in Germany that"},{"startMs":478520,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"the Jews in particular were operating as a fifth column in undermining the German war effort"},{"startMs":483520,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"because of course the Germans blamed the Jews and a variety of other people for actually setting up the conditions that made the war necessary"},{"startMs":490540,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and the police were sent into Poland, they were also required to make peace, roughly speaking"},{"startMs":497140,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"they started out by rounding up all the Jewish men between 18 and 65"},{"startMs":503200,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"and gathering them in stadiums, and then shipping them off on trains, but that isn't where they ended"},{"startMs":508820,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"they ended in a very, very dark place, I mean these guys were going out in the field with naked pregnant women"},{"startMs":515300,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"and shooting them in the back of the head by the end of their training"},{"startMs":518680,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"and what's really interesting about that is that their commander told them that they could go home at any time"},{"startMs":525760,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"so this is not one of those examples of people following orders"},{"startMs":530520,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"and the reason they didn't, roughly speaking, there's many reasons, but one of the reasons they didn't"},{"startMs":535860,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"is because they didn't think it was comradely, so to speak, to leave the guys they were working with"},{"startMs":542060,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"to do all the dirty work and run off; and that's a really interesting fact"},{"startMs":547320,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"because in different circumstances you wouldn't think about that as reprehensible"},{"startMs":552340,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"you'd think: well, that's part of team work under rough circumstances; and that's at least in part how they viewed it"},{"startMs":559300,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"they were also made physically ill multiple times, physically and psychologically ill, by the thing that they had to do"},{"startMs":565300,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"but they kept doing them anyways, so one step at a time"},{"startMs":569900,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"and that's the thing, is that you end up in very bad place one step at a time, so you better watch those steps"},{"startMs":575640,"durationMs":10100,"subtitle":"anyways, Pinokio has now decided, after his latest misadventure, to return to the proper pathway"},{"startMs":585740,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"he's off to school again, and he's still pretty naive, although perhaps not as much so as he was before"},{"startMs":592420,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"so he decided that he's gonna do things right, he's gonna go get educated, he's going back to school"},{"startMs":596740,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"he's gonna take the conventional route to discipline, and be a good boy, roughly speaking"},{"startMs":601480,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and so, he's off to school, and the fox waylays him again"},{"startMs":606520,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"this is a really interesting scene, took me quite a long time to unpack this too"},{"startMs":612780,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"and so, the fox, first of all, starts out by acting like he's sympathetic again, sympathetic towards Pinocchio"},{"startMs":620260,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"and so, he's empathetic, you could say, and... so this is an interesting analysis of empathy"},{"startMs":626880,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"so what happens is the fox convinces Pinokio through a variety of maneuvers"},{"startMs":633420,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"that he's actually not feeling very well, that he's sick, he really convinces him that he's a victim"},{"startMs":638360,"durationMs":8960,"subtitle":"and one of the things... I had a graduate student named Maya Maja Djikic, who had worked with the UN in Bosnia"},{"startMs":647320,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"and she had toured some of the mass grave sites there, and we wrote a paper one time, called:"},{"startMs":652340,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"\"You can neither remember nor forget what you don't understand\""},{"startMs":656520,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"and it was a paper about the idea, for example, it was partly about the idea that we should never forget the Holocaust"},{"startMs":663600,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and that the idea there is that, well, we should never forget it and we should never repeat it"},{"startMs":667520,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"but the thing is, if you don't understand how those things come about, you can't really remember them, right?"},{"startMs":672280,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"you think about them as a set of historical facts, but that's not the kind of remembering that actually makes any difference"},{"startMs":679140,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"you have to understand the causal pathways, you have to understand how a society would transform in that manner"},{"startMs":684880,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"and more importantly, you have to understand the role of the individuals within that society"},{"startMs":690200,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"unless you're going to assume that they're so completely unlike you that there's no connection whatsoever"},{"startMs":695440,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"in which case you haven't remembered it at all, you haven't learned anything at all"},{"startMs":699780,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"because the right lesson from what happened in the 20th century is: this is what human beings are like"},{"startMs":705120,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"that's the correct lesson, and you can say: well, not me; but..."},{"startMs":710580,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"but probably you too, that's the thing, probably"},{"startMs":717840,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and probably me too, and least under normal circumstances; anyways..."},{"startMs":722080,"durationMs":8500,"subtitle":"the Fox convinces Pinocchio that he's sick, he performs a lot of tricks to do this"},{"startMs":730580,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"now, you could say that Pinocchio is susceptible to this"},{"startMs":735600,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"because maybe there's still a part of him that's looking for the easy way out, and so..."},{"startMs":739980,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"one of the things that Maja and I found when we were writing this paper"},{"startMs":743880,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"we were looking at the discourse that precedes genocide and genocidal states"},{"startMs":748040,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and the enhancement of a sense of victimization on the part of one of the groups"},{"startMs":752760,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"usually the group that's going to commit the genocide"},{"startMs":755320,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"first of all, their sense of being victims is much heightened by the demagogues"},{"startMs":761260,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"who are trying to stir up this sort of hatred, so they basically say: look, you've been oppressed in a variety of ways"},{"startMs":766500,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"and these are the people who did it, and they're not gonna stop doing it, and this time we're gonna get them before they get us"},{"startMs":771440,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"it's something like that; and so there's something very pathological about the enhancement of victimization"},{"startMs":778220,"durationMs":13980,"subtitle":"which is, well... see the problem as far as I'm concerned with it is, it's not thought through very well"},{"startMs":792200,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"because there's a point that's being made, and the point is that people have been oppressed and they suffer"},{"startMs":800440,"durationMs":10600,"subtitle":"and that's true, that point; but then the proper framework from within which to interpret that"},{"startMs":811040,"durationMs":7700,"subtitle":"I believe is that that's characteristic of life, you can't take it personally in some sense"},{"startMs":818740,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and you can't divide the world neatly into perpetrators and victims"},{"startMs":822640,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and you certainly can't divide the whole world neatly into perpetrators and victims and then assume that you're only in the victim class"},{"startMs":828220,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and then assume that that gives you certain... like access to certain... forms of redress, let's say"},{"startMs":835180,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"it gets dangerous very rapidly if you do that sort of thing, so...

darkness, and that's what Pinokio disappears into"},{"startMs":6207320,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"and then we see Monstro, he's in this sort of foggy representation, this huge thing that lies very much at the bottom"},{"startMs":6214680,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"and there's no life or anything around him except, I think these are mackerel, but maybe they're tuna"},{"startMs":6220940,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"they're animated anyway, so it doesn't matter"},{"startMs":6223700,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"but there's no life down there, he's so far down at the bottom of the ocean that there's nothing that's alive down there"},{"startMs":6229100,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"so, and then we go inside the whale, which is, of course, abzurd"},{"startMs":6233180,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"we see that the whale has eaten a boat at some point in the past, this is one whopping whale"},{"startMs":6238220,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"and Gepetto is sitting with the kitten, of all things,"},{"startMs":6242080,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"he's also got that litte goldfish

thing"},{"startMs":6259320,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"but the father is lacking the son, and there's some indication that the father can't get out of the whale without the

Gepetto is feeling pretty hopeless"},{"startMs":6298160,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"because he can't figure out any way of getting out of the whale, and he's also starving"},{"startMs":6302180,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"he's starving in the belly of the whale"},{"startMs":6306300,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"here's a way of thinking about that:"},{"startMs":6313180,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"Gepetto's a good guy, but he's old"},{"startMs":6316900,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"and that means his way of doing things is no longer fruitful, that's why he's starving"},{"startMs":6321920,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and it's especially not fruitful, 'cause he's missing his

represents"},{"startMs":6331640,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"and so, if you get stuck doing something the same old way, at some point it's no longer going to work"},{"startMs":6336560,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"even if it was good at some point; it has to be updated"},{"startMs":6339960,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and it's updated by, let's call it the spirit of youth, or the spirit of attention, or the spirit of play, something like that"},{"startMs":6345720,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"the willingness to break boundaries and take risks; and Gepetto is very, very skilled, but"},{"startMs":6351700,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"but he doesn't have that, and that's symbolized by the loss of his son"},{"startMs":6355460,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"that's why he was out looking for his son too, he needs him; and so, they're in despair down there"},{"startMs":6360880,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"trying to fish and not getting anything, and so..."},{"startMs":6364880,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"Monstro wakes up"},{"startMs":6368700,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"a mackerel happens to swim by and Monstro wakes up, and so..."},{"startMs":6373900,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"I think they're tuna, actually, they look like tuna to me"},{"startMs":6377780,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and so, Monstro wakes up and he opens his mouth, and a bunch of water starts to come in"},{"startMs":6383160,"durationMs":7580,"subtitle":"and so, and then you see Pinokio with the fish, now..."},{"startMs":6390740,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"there's very intense implicit Christian symbolism in this part of the film"},{"startMs":6395660,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"and I'm gonna lay it out point by point, so"},{"startMs":6399400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you may remember

fish are strange things"},{"startMs":6419100,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"because, well, you can pull then up out of the depths, that's part of it"},{"startMs":6422540,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"and so they're things that can be pulled out of the depth; and you could say that..."},{"startMs":6428100,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"it's going to be very difficult for me to take this apart, but you can say in some sense that Christ is a meta-fish"},{"startMs":6434300,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"a fish is something that you can dine on"},{"startMs":6438780,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"but a way of being is something that provides you with something to dine on on a continual basis"},{"startMs":6445420,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"and so, you might say, well, is it better to have a fish or to be a fisherman?"},{"startMs":6450500,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"that's another way of thinking about it, and obviously it's better to be a fisherman, because then you can get more fish"},{"startMs":6455480,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"and so, it's one thing to have something, but it's another thing completely to know how to generate good things"},{"startMs":6463440,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"and so, if you had any sense, you'd take the latter over the former"},{"startMs":6468040,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"even though the former is more instantaneously gratifying and requires less work and responsibility"},{"startMs":6473700,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"and so, anyways, the whale opens his mouth and goes chasing these fish"},{"startMs":6478820,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"and Pinokio tries... he's trying to get the hell out of there, even though he wants to find the whale"},{"startMs":6483420,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"when he actually sees the whale, he leaves"},{"startMs":6485800,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"and that's also a very common mythological, umm, what would you call it? plot element"},{"startMs":6493320,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"it's very frequently that what happens when the hero first sees the terrible thing, the dragon, say"},{"startMs":6498260,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"the terrible thing that he's come to conquer he freezes and gets the hell out of there, because"},{"startMs":6502400,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"it's far worse than he thought it was going to be; and so Pinokio is like: no way, man"},{"startMs":6507520,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"I'm not going near that whale; and away he swims, and he's actually at the forefront of all the fish, which is quite interesting too"},{"startMs":6513480,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"so, in the mean time Monstro has opened his mouth, and the fish are pouring in, and Gepetto is fishing like mad, and he's catching fish"},{"startMs":6521320,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"like crazy; and so, the little cat is..."},{"startMs":6525420,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"Gepetto is flinging the fish backwards into this, like, box"},{"startMs":6529340,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"and the little cat is there, whacking them to kill them while they're flopping around"},{"startMs":6534960,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and so they're pretty excited about this, because... they have a problem, the problem is how to get out of the whale"},{"startMs":6540800,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"that's the actual problem; but a nested problem inside that is how not to starve to death"},{"startMs":6546080,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and so, Gepetto's pretty happy that even though he's not getting out of the whale, that he gets to have something to eat"},{"startMs":6551920,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"so you could say as well, that he's not exactly focused on the right thing"},{"startMs":6556000,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"he's focused on the micro-problem instead of the macro-problem, and that makes him kind of blind"},{"startMs":6560940,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"so anyways, the whale swallows up Pinokio, and"},{"startMs":6567180,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"Gepetto keeps fishing; and then he snags Pinokio"},{"startMs":6571700,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"now this is cool, because... and this is another example of that meta-fish idea"},{"startMs":6577600,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"it's like...
