Peterson speaks with Dr. Scott McMahon and Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. They discuss their potentially groundbreaking research into CIRS, or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Backed by research, these two doctors believe that many other illnesses and syndromes such as fibromyalgia, obesity, and even depression might actually be caused by mutations in common mold as a response to our own efforts to live in a hypoallergenic world. \n\nScott W. McMahon, MD, founder of Whole World Healthcare has been practicing pediatrics in Roswell, New Mexico, for 26 years. His interest in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) began in 2009. Dr. McMahon first learned about CIRS after being approached by a businessman whose daughter became ill while attending a local school. The search for this child’s healing led him to Dr. Richie Shoemaker, the global expert on mold illnesses. McMahon visited Dr. Shoemaker’s practice to learn about the treatment for CIRS and saw the tremendous need for more physicians prepared to treat CIRS. He immediately opened a practice in Roswell specifically to diagnose and treat patients with CIRS, starting with 15 patients from the local school. His CIRS practice has now grown and he has seen thousands of adults and children to date.\n\nThis episode was recorded on December 27th, 2023\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nPreBorn!: ​​Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\n\n2024 tour details can be found here - https://jordanbpeterson.com/events  \n\nPeterson Academy https://petersonacademy.com/ \n\n\nFor Dr. McMahon and Dr. Shoemaker:\n\nSurviving Mold (website) https://www.survivingmold.com/legal-resources/physician-referral-information/dr-scott-w-mcmahon-bio \n\nCIRS Diagnoses https://scottmcmahon.doctor/ \n\nBoot Camp: A Beginners Guide to Spiritual Warfare\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Boot-Camp-Beginners-Spiritual-Warfare-ebook/dp/B09QBKMP9Y/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1703614821&refinements=p_27%3ADr.+Scott+W.+McMahon&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Dr.+Scott+W.+McMahon \n\nThe Art and Science of CIRS Medicine https://www.survivingmold.com/store/books/art-and-science-of-cirs \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Tour Update\n(0:40) Coming up\n(0:59) Intro\n(3:32) The CIRS rabbit hole\n(11:18) What percentage of buildings are affected?\n(17:55) How natural selection created super toxins\n(20:20) Susceptible architecture, unintended consequences\n(22:48) What level of contamination constitutes a critical issue?\n(26:25) 3/4ths of people are at risk\n(29:20) Overlapping symptoms, bio-markers suggest it’s not coincidence\n(34:23) The prime biomarkers and why they are valid\n(39:56) How they test for CIRS using capillary blood cell speed\n(43:04) Response time and tendency to occur\n(48:36) Behavioral, cognitive, and emotional symptoms\n(51:15) How they evaluate brain function\n(56:52) Common illnesses and conditions that may actually be CIRS\n(1:12:57) Intensification and inflammation reduction\n(1:16:55) How should CIRS impact social interaction?\n(1:20:36) Is CIRS causing Obesity?\n(1:22:38) The GOV found their research credible, then ignored them\n(1:25:26) Falling into misdiagnoses\n(1:26:40) CIRS and children\n(1:29:12) How genetics drives susceptibility\n(1:36:43) Alzheimer’s Disease \n(1:40:29) 60 papers published, and still fighting for progress against the scientific community\n\n\n\n// LINKS //\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nTour Locations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nX: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGG7om1hHcU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGG7om1hHcU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGG7om1hHcU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGG7om1hHcU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGG7om1hHcU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"LGG7om1hHcU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"wPPb-RgU7pK1NZqq8wTsVsZ4NPU","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlFOdTFfd252ZXlB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2024-01-15T22:01:26Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Dr. Peterson and John Vervaeke Discuss the Meaning Crisis | EP 414","description":"Dr. Jordan B.

Peterson speaks with English actor, musician, broadcaster, and party leader Laurence Fox. They discuss his current canceling, arrest, and litigation, the globalist scheming of London's current mayor, Sadiq Khan, the ironic expansion of surveillance cameras across England, and the state of Western Democracy when removed from humor, art, and nuance.\n\nLaurence Fox graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2001. He debuted as a screen actor in 2001’s The Hole, directed by Nick Hamm. He is likely best known in the entertainment world for his 10 year stint as James Hathaway in the TV show Lewis.

Peterson Interviews Former U.S. Most Wanted Cybercriminal | Brett Johnson | EP 406","description":"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with Brett Johnson, formerly the United States’ most wanted cyber criminal, now a public speaker and expert on cyber security. They discuss the nurturing of a child into a criminal, the compartmentalization of guilt, the psychology of exploitation, the creation of the precursor to the dark web, and what caused Johnson to walk away completely.\n\nBrett Johnson. Former U.S. Most Wanted Cybercriminal. Now Good Guy. The United States Secret Service called Mr. Johnson \"The Original Internet Godfather\" for his role in refining modern financial cybercrime. Or to put it another way: Brett was convicted of 39 felonies, placed on the U.S. Most Wanted List, escaped from prison, and … he built the first organized cybercrime community, Shadowcrew. Shadowcrew was a precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets, and it laid the foundation for the way modern cybercrime channels operate today. Johnson was sentenced to 90 months in Federal Prison. End of story? Not hardly. Brett found redemption through his sister, his wife Michele, and finally the FBI. He was given the chance to turn his life around. He took it. Today, Brett is considered one of the leading authorities on cybercrime, identity theft, and cybersecurity on the planet. He works hard to protect businesses and consumers from the type of person he used to be.\n\nThis episode was filmed November 20th, 2023\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nPreBorn!: Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nExodus90: Is it time for your Exodus?

Demons of Childhood Trauma | Aaron Stark | EP 405","description":"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with public speaker and mental health advocate Aaron Stark. You might recognize Aaron's name from his deeply impactful TED Talk, “I was almost a school shooter.” They walk through his life story and discuss the all-too-real result of deep parental trauma, the psychology of abuse that shapes self loathing and self harm, the drivers that nearly pushed Aaron from victim into monster, and the real, tangible act of kindness that saved lives.\n\nAaron Stark was almost a school shooter. As a dark and destructive teen, Stark almost committed a terrible attack. Today he is a happy father of four, and he wants to do all he can to help anyone on that path to find a way into the light again and to see that they matter.\n\nAfter watching the news coverage of the Parkland school shootings, Stark wrote an open letter, “I was almost a school shooter.” This was sent to local news 9KUSA in Denver and was the feature story on “Next with Kyle Clark.” This story gained national attention and over 17 million views in a very short time, which propelled him into a life of activism for mental wellness awareness. He has been featured on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and has published an article in the Washington Post. These features were followed by his viral TEDx talk, “I Was Almost a School Shooter” that currently has over 14 million views and is shown in schools, colleges, and universities, all the way up to the Dept. of Education.\n\nThis episode was filmed November 15th, 2023\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 to check out Birch Gold’s Holiday Deals!

Josh has been denied an education at the Renfrew County Catholic District School Board since November 2022, after speaking out against the radical left-wing gender ideology in schools. After three arrests since February, one having been at his high school, Josh has continued to publicly uphold his convictions in the face of the rapidly developing censorious state.\n\nNick Alexander is the older brother of Josh Alexander. He has been arrested 3 times and removed from his fire department for exercising his rights to oppose the mainstream narrative. Nick recently made headlines after being assaulted with an edged weapon by union supported counter protestors and then arrested.\n\nTogether Josh and Nick lead the Save Canada movement as it sweeps the country bringing the message of truth to our youth and providing a rallying point for concerned citizens.\n\nThis episode was filmed on\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nTax Network USA: Take the first step toward resolving your tax debt!\nhttp://www.TaxNetworkUSA.com/Peterson\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Josh and Nick Alexander:\n\nJosh's X:\nhttps://x.com/officialJosh_A?t=qZoEDTEB1j3Q-U1OfPUnJA&s=09\n\nNick's X:\nhttps://x.com/Nick_SaveCanada?t=VjnOg0J9wS3no8plwh-QXg&s=09\n\nJosh's Instagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/josh.alexander_savecanada?igshid=NzZlODBkYWE4Ng==\n\nNick's Instagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/nick.alexander_savecanada?igshid=NzZlODBkYWE4Ng==\n\nSave Canada website: https://savecanada.shop/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:17) Intro\n(1:16) Running into trouble at school\n(3:02) Lockdown restrictions: both sides of the argument\n(4:45) What happened to rebelliousness in youth?\n(6:03) A model student\n(7:23) The effect of lockdowns on teenagers\n(9:50) We did not comply\n(13:32) Ottawa, walkouts, arguing with the principle\n(18:43) The Alexander family, harassment and resolve\n(24:03) Attacked by ANTIFA, “the police did nothing”\n(27:26) Staying calm in the chaos of anti-protestors\n(29:39) Interrogated and arrested for handing out scripture\n(33:10) Jagmeet Singh, “all the faults of Trudeau, none of the (few) virtues”\n(36:33) Attacked by a masked assailant\n(42:00) Wild Bill, standing up against the Toronto police\n(43:07) Nick gets arrested, “Bleeding without a permit”\n(50:45) Locked out of the police station, calls refused\n(54:56) Refused medical treatment\n(58:28) Rationale for ongoing suspension\n(59:51) When your math teacher preaches gender ideology, tolerance is not a virtue\n(1:02:41) Ridiculous conditions for return to school, “not disciplinary”\n(1:06:48) Fighting the board, winning the first case\n(1:08:10) Parents vs. the teachers union, suspended with pay\n(1:10:16) What the education system actually produces\n(1:15:00) How the Alexanders organize an event, how to get involved\n(1:19:05) Pierre Poilievre: lacking the support of officials\n(1:26:22) Meeting Billboard Chris, “I love J.

Peterson sits down with the current president of the Heritage Foundation, Dr. Kevin Roberts. They discuss the operations and practical utility of think tanks, the state of progressivism across academia, how multiple generations of students are now incapable of facing adversity while claiming to fight it, and why intellectual combat is not something to shut down, but to champion against dire falsehoods. \n\nDr. Kevin Roberts is the current and 7th president of the Heritage Foundation (granted the role in 2021), an American Conservative think tank tackling issues on border control, immigration, inflation, among many other policy driven topics.

He has written several books, and was a professor at Oxford and Green Templeton College (Now retired) where he specialized in group theory.

Peterson sits down with Australian journalist and former prime minister, the Honourable Tony Abbott. They discuss Australia’s role on the world stage, the problems facing their economy and culture, how the quasi-cult of carbon threatens the developing world, why new religions propagate where faith has been abdicated, and the looming threat of war as China destabilizes while Putin pushes forward against Ukraine.\n\nTony Abbott was elected prime minister by the Australian people on September 7, 2013, and served for two years. In that time, the carbon tax and mining tax were repealed, free trade agreements were finalized with China, Japan and Korea; the people smuggling trade from Indonesia to Australia were halted, and Australia became the second largest military contributor to the US-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. Currently, he is a director of the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilization, serves on the council of the Australian War Memorial, and is an adviser to the UK Board of Trade.

Hence The Postmodernist Drinking Song. \n\nThe Postmodernist Drinking Song is based on an old English folk song, The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham, by way of a 1960’s British pop group, the Scaffold, whose variant Lily the Pink reached number one in the UK singles chart in ’68 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x8D4T--0v4 ). Our version was partly inspired, as well, by the brilliant idiocy of Monty Python’s The Philosophers Song, which celebrated the drunken shenanigans of the greatest thinkers of the Western tradition ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg ).\n\nPostmodernism is a school of thought, increasingly dominant in what still passes for the modern academy, that famously rejects “grand narratives”—“collective myths that never had a reality,” as certain philosophers have it ( https://shorturl.at/fMO46 ). Equally famously, however, the same thinkers turned, post-rejection, to the murderous blandishments of the Marxist story, which was in turn based on an even longer tradition of Luciferian arrogance and bitter resentment. No grand narrative--except, of course, that of power (with a nice dollop of immature hedonism tossed in, just to sweeten the pot). \n   \nOur Cast (in order of appearance): \nJordan B Peterson thoroughly-masked resentful Taco delivery boy and heroic Antifa activist\nRandom far-right cat (well-petted)\nUnknown green-haired narcissist\nUnknown trucker convoy participant\nMichel Foucault puppet of Satan himself\nVarious victim-children puppets\nMikhaila Peterson enemy to vegans and far-right daughter\nCommie pig\nDave Rubin far-right comedian\nDouglas Murray far-right journalist and piano prodigy\nJacques Derrida that old joker puppet\nZuby far-right rapper and women’s powerlifting record holder\nJonathan Pageau far-right Old Testament prophet and Frenchman\nMichael Malice whatever the hell he is\nKonstantin Kisin far-right dangerous Russian\nUnknown blue-haired beautiful woman\nBen Shapiro squeaking horribly\nGad Saad reprehensible far-right purple-haired professor provocateur and evil Jew\nRobin DiAngelo puppet and demented-denizens-of-the-corporate-world charmer\n\nLyrics by Jordan B.

They also examine the state of the world today with Russia and the U.S. military industrial complex, the upcoming presidential election, and the dire necessity for alternative news sources.\n\nMatt Taibbi is an award-winning investigative reporter and one of America’s more recognizable literary voices.  In 2002, Taibbi began work as a contributing editor for Rolling Stone. There he won the National Magazine Award for commentary.

He has written ten books, including four New York Times bestsellers: The Great Derangement, Griftopia, The Divide, and Insane Clown President. His book, I Can’t Breathe, about the police killing of Eric Garner, was named one of the year’s ten best books by the Washington Post.

Peterson sits down with author, journalist, and political commentator Glenn Greenwald. They discuss the war on information: how social moralism, religious rhetoric, conceptual safety, and false compassion have been used and propagandized to reshape the western world into a good versus bad, red versus blue polarity. They also explore the human need for meta narratives, the basis of morality, and the case for God in a world that offers nihilism.\n\n​​Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, author, and former constitutional law attorney. His original hit blog was a springboard into writing for Salon and the Guardian with a focus on national security issues. In 2013, he published the now iconic Snowden documents detailing global government surveillance by the U.S. and British governments. In 2019 Greenwald again broke leaked documents, this time for “Operation Car Wash,” which shone a spotlight on the corruption of the Brazilian judicial system. He would later detail his work in a series of books such as Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Brazil and No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nEp.391\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nShopify: \nGet a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\nTax Network: Take the first step toward resolving your tax debt!\nhttp://www.TaxNetworkUSA.com/Peterson\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Glenn Greenwald:\n\nOn X https://twitter.com/ggreenwald?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\nWatch System Update on youtube https://www.youtube.com/@GlennGreenwald \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:04) Intro\n(2:02) Rachel Maddow, the American Left\n(5:15) Defending a Neo-Nazi\n(8:41) The illusion on free speech when paying consequences\n(16:45) Milo Yiannopoulos was propelled by censorship\n(18:55) Taking down our RFK Jr. interview\n(28:58) 911 and the clamp down of civil liberties\n(32:48) Free speech is necessary for us to solve global problems\n(36:45) George Orwell’s unpublished preface\n(38:31) The internet was created with the spirit of Libertarianism\n(43:23) The conceptualization of good and evil\n(47:32) The danger of hubris in religion\n(51:46) Douglas Murray, the need for ethics grounded in a metaphysical narrative\n(56:34) Abraham, the manifestation of the animating spirit\n(1:03:56) From atheist to believer, why Greenwald changed his mind\n(1:08:27) Writing on politics, changing his stance\n(1:17:00) Prohibitions against “wrong think” are silencing the majority opinion\n(1:21:55) Edward Snowden, the real government behind the one we know\n(1:25:58) Manufactured fear has allowed establishment control to expand\n(1:29:59) The loss of the genuine left\n(1:37:56) When you’re thinking is backed by every major news outlet and corporation, are you really a rebel?\n\n\n// LINKS //\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\nE3KTNJ2QOHNEX1PE\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3h7pmhyIwg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3h7pmhyIwg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3h7pmhyIwg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3h7pmhyIwg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3h7pmhyIwg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":33,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"T3h7pmhyIwg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"uecJ-2gk83qu0fd5pxrrNzkp9Mc","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmhaUWx2OXJRTEp3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-26T16:33:59Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Safety--Or Freedom?

He has spent decades studying primates in the wild, written numerous articles and books, as well as produced multiple video series on the subject. By the age of 12, Sapolsky was writing to well known primatologists as a fan, and had also begun teaching himself Swahili with the early ambition of heading to Tanzanian, Mozambique, and Kenya in search of his own primates (Specifically Silverback Gorillas) to study. Not too much later, Sapolsky would make contact with a group of gorillas in Kenya, a group he would visit every year for 25 years, spending 4 months studying them at a time.  Sapolsky would go on to become the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology &

Yet? | Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott | EP 388","description":"Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott to discuss the inception of their new book, “The Canceling of the American Mind,” which seeks to assess cancel culture as it harshly affects American universities and institutions. They also break down the differences between feminine and masculine tendencies in regards to free speech, the entirely real and yet rarely discussed toxic femininity, and why we must prioritize a cultural shift away from the ease of victimhood.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nGreg Lukianoff is a journalist, producer, attorney, New York Times bestselling author, and the president and CEO of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), which is the nation's leading defender of fundamental rights on college campuses. In 2022, FIRE announced they would expand their coverage to fundamental rights off-campus as well, and at this time added “Expression” to their name and mission statement.\n\nRikki Schlott is a New York City-based journalist and political commentator. She is a former research fellow at FIRE, host of the Lost Debate podcast, a columnist at the New York Post, and a regular contributor to numerous publications and television programs. Her commentary focuses on free speech, campus culture, civil liberties, and youth issues from a Generation Z perspective.\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\n“The Canceling of the American Mind” (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Canceling-American-Mind-Undermines-Threatens/dp/1668019140/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KWJ4S9GF9BI0&keywords=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind&qid=1697485877&sprefix=the+cancelling+of+the+american+mind%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1 \n\nFor Greg Lukianoff:\n\nFIRE Website https://www.thefire.org/about-us/our-team/greg-lukianoff \nOn Twitter https://twitter.com/glukianoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/glukianoff/?hl=en \nOn Substack https://greglukianoff.substack.com/ \n\n\nFor Rikki Schlott:\n\nWebsite https://www.rikkischlott.com \nOn Twitter  https://twitter.com/rikkischlott\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/rikkischlott/\nOn Substack rikkischlott.substack.com\n\n\n- Chapters - \n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:17) Intro\n(1:06) The Cancelling of the American Mind\n(7:08) Mired in politics at younger and younger ages\n(10:43) Toxic femininity versus free speech\n(20:34) Can colleges survive female-led administrations?\n(26:06) Why people with female temperaments feel negative emotion more\n(31:56) Rhetorical fortresses\n(34:59) You don’t need elite schools for an elite education\n(37:52) Genuine accreditation\n(38:41) Do men and woman have the same cognitive ability?\n(40:28) What caused the modern era of cancel culture\n(45:46) Education Reform, Christopher Rufo\n(54:51) Teacher certification and captured research\n(1:00:48) The backlash Rikki has faced as woman\n(1:03:59) Cancel culture thrives on making you feel alone\n(1:06:25) Consequences of honesty, and the rewards\n(1:11:16) The harm in promoting nonsense from the guise of academia\n(1:13:35) Harvard scored below zero on campus freedom of speech\n(1:20:43) How you know a system does not work\n(1:24:09) When colleges promote excellence…\n(1:26:17) Re-education and DEI training\n(1:31:33) The depressing outlook of young people today: censorship, high costs, and debt\n(1:35:58) Social media and zoom behavior during the pandemic\n(1:37:02) Consequences of women growing up in the social media world\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KukpEgjkXIk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KukpEgjkXIk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KukpEgjkXIk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KukpEgjkXIk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KukpEgjkXIk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":40,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"KukpEgjkXIk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Xw57NwgmmLZWVq8FC9lwZNIJLME","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlNQbnl4bnZVNGtv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-10-12T21:00:13Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Is Reality an Illusion? | Dr. Donald Hoffman | EP 387","description":"Dr. Jordan B Peterson and cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Donald Hoffman discuss what we know as reality, why space time is now being considered a “doomed” framework, and how consciousness can be understood as a vast probability space within which we orient ourselves.\n\nHoffman received a Bachelor of Arts degree in quantitative psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles, and then his Doctorate of Philosophy in computational psychology at MIT. He briefly worked as a research scientist at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, before taking on the role of assistant professor at the University of California at Irvine. He is now a professor in the department of Cognitive Sciences. He has written four books (below), on the topics of human vision, perception, consciousness, and the effects of/reasons for evolution on each. He is also a key proponent of MUI (Multimodal User Interface) theory, which states that \"perceptual experiences do not match or approximate properties of the objective world, but instead provide a simplified, species-specific, user interface to that world.\" Hoffman argues that conscious beings have not evolved to perceive the world as it actually is but have evolved to perceive the world in a way that maximizes \"fitness payoffs.”\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nPreBorn!: Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Dr. Donald Hoffman:\n\n\"The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes\" (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Reality-Evolution-Truth-ebook/dp/B07JR1FDXH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1OMOD0ZGPHCT9&keywords=the+case+against+reality&qid=1697060197&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+case+against%2Cdigital-text%2C189&sr=1-1 \n\n\"Visual Intelligence: How We Create What We See\" (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Intelligence-How-Create-What/dp/0393319679/ref=sr_1_1?crid=QZBIXXULF7VC&keywords=Visual+intelligence+hoffman&qid=1697060273&s=digital-text&sprefix=visual+intelligence+hoffman%2Cdigital-text%2C138&sr=1-1-catcorr \n\nDr. Hoffman on X https://twitter.com/donalddhoffman?lang=en \n\nDr. Hoffman's Ted Talk https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is?language=en \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:24) Intro\n(1:30) Dr. Hoffman's theory of perception\n(4:12) Fitness payoffs\n(9:40) How has “reality” been shaped by evolution?\n(18:19) Iconography, constraints, and pragmatism\n(23:25) The VR headset analogy, the underlying reality\n(27:54) Levels of potential patterning, “specifying the grip”\n(37:08) Consciousness as conceptualized in mythology\n(39:55) Why spacetime is a doomed framework, the theory of conscious agents\n(46:53) Karl Friston, anxiety, and entropy\n(51:59) How anxiety disorders warp your probability space\n(54:25) Time is the fundamental limited resource\n(57:41) Our reality is a projection of what lies deeper\n(1:00:00) Every scientific endeavor starts with inherent axioms of faith\n(1:05:34) Dawkins, reproduction, and the role of sex\n(1:13:48) Is consciousness the primary reality?\n(1:16:14) That which God lacks\n(1:18:47) When the math backs the impossible\n(1:23:50) There is no theory of everything\n(1:24:45) Evolutionary game theory\n(1:28:03) What lies beyond spacetime absolutely matters within it\n(1:31:00) How has this understanding of reality affected Dr. Hoffman existentially?

in the show, how they were preserved behind-the-scenes, the balance between reality and fiction, structure and playful spontaneity that was captured on “Duck Dynasty,” and the true positive impact the show had on viewers, as well as the culture of America during and since its phenomenal 11-season run.\n\nWillie and Korie Robertson are the stars of A&E’s hit reality TV show “Duck Dynasty” and executive producers of “The Blind,” the true story of the Robertson family. Together, they grew their family business, Duck Commander, from a living room operation into a destination for all things outdoors. They also built Tread Lively, a multimedia production company that creates films, television shows, and award-winning podcasts that uplift the culture. \n\nThe Robertsons' story is a remarkable example of entrepreneurship built on faith, family, and ducks, in that order. Married for 31 years, they live in West Monroe, Louisiana, with their large and growing family. Their writing credits include “The Duck Commander Family: How Faith, Family, and Ducks Built a Dynasty,” “American Hunter,” “American Entrepreneur,” and “Strong and Kind: Raising Kids of Character.” Willie and Korie are passionate about adoption, storytelling, and doing life with their kids and grand-babies.

He received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999 and has taught at Duke University ever since. He is a fellow of the Econometric Society and the International Association of Applied Econometricians.

The Chord of an Entire Country | Oliver Anthony | EP 382","description":"Ep. 382\n\nDr. Jordan B Peterson and breakout musician Chris Lunsford, better known by his stage name Oliver Anthony, discuss the balance between vision and efficiency in artistic and commercial endeavors, why Chris’ hit song “Rich Men North of Richmond,” has resonated so broadly and so quickly, the way honest expression through music can combat demoralization, how politics have become confused with the sacred, and what we can do to restore each to their proper order.\n\nOliver Anthony, real name Christopher Anthony Lunsford, is an American country/folk musician from Farmville, Virginia. He just recently went viral for his anthem song, “Rich Men North of Richmond” – which has resonated across the country for its messaging about Washington D.C. and the state of poverty and mental health in the broader U.S.. Chris has stated his politics as being right down or near the center, though already tribalism has attempted to take hold of or alternatively reduce/dismiss him, all the while “Rich Men” has amassed nearly 60 million views on YT in just over a month, and trended the billboard charts (Hitting number one more than once) since its release. Chris named his YT channel Oliver Anthony Music after his grandfather, whom he has described as a “real 1930’s Appalachian man.” Since his song's virality, he has already been offered – and turned down – an 8 million dollar recording contract, and is making waves as a truly authentic artist both in performance and practice.\n\nJordan’s Spotify country song playlist:

Peterson and “The mother of mindfulness,” Dr. Ellen Langer discuss her latest book, The Mindful Body: Thinking Our Way To Chronic Health. From this they explore how intentioned awareness paired with humility allows for a healthier mindset and body, how the perception of time impacts the effects of disease and age, the way to view tragedy and suffering so that we may conquer it through faith and hope, and the immense benefits found in carefully considering to what, where, and who you direct your attention.\n\nEllen J. Langer was the first woman to be tenured in psychology at Harvard, where she is still professor of psychology. The recipient of three Distinguished Scientists awards, the Arthur W. Staats Award for Unifying Psychology, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Liberty Science Genius Award, Dr. Langer is the author of eleven other books, including the international bestseller Mindfulness, as well as The Power of Mindful Learning, Counterclockwise and On Becoming an Artist. Her trailblazing experiments in social psychology have earned her inclusion in The New York Times Magazine’s “Year in Ideas” issue. She is known worldwide as the “mother of mindfulness” and the “mother of positive psychology”.

Peterson and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy discuss his ongoing campaign, the long-growing hunger for depth in political discussion, the dire need for a renewed American vision, and how Vivek plans to strip the Washington administrative agencies of their unconstitutional powers.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur, author, and political activist. Vivek has been making headlines since announcing his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, running on a platform in part to dismantle the expansive and corrupt bureaucracy that has seeped into nearly all facets of American government. Prior to this, Ramaswamy was the founder and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences. Leaving in 2021, he published “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.” In 2022, he co-founded Strive Asset Management with Anson Frericks, which focuses on an alternative to the now-pushed ESG investment framework. That same year Ramaswamy published “Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.” and has since been deemed one of the “Intellectual Godfathers of the anti-woke movement.”\n\nExodus will be available for a limited time on YouTube, so be sure to watch as new episodes release each Monday - https://youtu.be/GEASnFvLxhU\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nPreBorn!: Help save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Vivek Ramaswamy:\n\nFor more information on Vivek’s campaign:  https://www.vivek2024.com/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:28) Intro\n(1:13) Don’t dumb yourself down\n(6:38) A mistake by the Republicans\n(10:26) Short form media is entertainment\n(11:21) Starved for connection\n(14:00) Where podcasting has advanced beyond books\n(17:05) Campaign spending and how it impacts success\n(20:40) People know they are being lied to, a revolutionary moment\n(25:12) Where Trump went wrong\n(28:43) 75 percent of Washington bureaucrats will be fired\n(35:10) A perfect intersection: science, law, business\n(44:36) What would our founding fathers say?\n(47:12) The U.S. President needs to have this ability\n(51:07) What Vivek wants to be able to tell his children\n(52:53) What a renewed America will look like\n(57:27) We need to be a nation under God\n(1:01:14) Alternatives to tyranny, the hierarchy of importance\n(1:06:07) A reawakening of American values\n(1:10:02) Balancing family responsibility with ambition\n(1:19:06) Your sanity is a socially negotiated phenomena\n(1:21:24) Preaching what you practice\n(1:24:00) When someone who loves you pushes you\n(1:27:13) The beneficial adversary, choosing who you marry\n(1:38:39) Speak the truth without attachment to the result\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlTY7VzqBwc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":57,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"rlTY7VzqBwc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"zlUoPJKj39XpzSTj2LFuQHyYjBI","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjFuS2xUQlZiLXdR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-08-10T15:06:07Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"The War for Reality | Helen Joyce | EP 379","description":"Ep. 379\n\nWhat you are about to watch is an abridged version of the full interview between Dr. Jordan B.

Its contents were so impactful and widely needed that the DW+ executive team and Dr. Peterson decided to make the series available for free on YouTube for a limited time. The series has since been returned to its permanent home on the DailyWire+ platform. You can view episode 1 for free on YouTube. The remainder of the series can be viewed exclusively on DailyWire+. Thank you for joining us as we journey through the Great Book of Exodus. \n\nIn episode one, Jordan and his roundtable explore the themes of freedom against tyranny, God’s allowance of evil, and faith as an adventure within the first three chapters of Exodus. They seek to answer the question of whether one should take the easy path even if it is wrong or do what is right despite it being hard.\n\nThank you very much to all the participants: Dr. Os Guiness, Dr. Douglas Hedley, Dr. James Orr, Dr. Larry Arnn, Gregg Hurwitz, Ben Shapiro, Dr. Dennis Prager, Dr. Stephen Blackwood, Jonathan Pageau, and Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.\n\nAnd thank you very much to the DailyWire+ crew for having the vision and generosity of spirit to make this Exodus seminar freely available to all who are interested.

Peterson and Eric Edmeades discuss his early experiences with homelessness, the extent and detriment of alcoholism, the changes you can make to restructure your physiological responses, the relationship between trust and sales, and the world of possibility that opens when you embrace the unknown, the potentially dangerous, and above all that which calls to you. \n\nEric Edmeades, a globally recognized keynote speaker, prolific entrepreneur, and recognized authority in health, practical psychology, and behavioral transformation, has made significant strides in the health and wellness industry. His revolutionary program, WILDFIT®, has positively transformed the lives of over a hundred thousand individuals across more than 130 countries, underscoring his innovative and impactful approach to health. Edmeades is in the process of releasing his forthcoming book, \"The Evolution Gap: A Survival Guide for Modern Civilization\". This enlightening work explores the growing disconnect between our slow-moving biological evolution and our remarkable ability to innovate at a breakneck pace. Edmeades suggests that this gap is the root cause of much of today's pain, suffering, and disease, and he provides practical strategies to bridge this divide and enhance our collective wellbeing. \n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nMy Patriot Supply: \nMAJOR savings on your 4-week Emergency Food Kit\nhttp://www.preparewithPeterson.com/ \n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Eric Edmeades:\n\nThe Evolution Gap (Book): https://ericedmeades.com/resources/jordan/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:26) Intro\n(1:56) South Africa, Canada, homelessness, and alcoholism\n(5:32) A good deal, living in an arcade\n(8:19) Strong ties to South Africa\n(9:30) The choice to leave, Megafauna\n(13:24) School, work, citizenship: struggling forward\n(17:42) Starting to drink, effects of alcoholism\n(22:21) How alcohol boosts confidence\n(27:30) Benefits of a stern father\n(32:47) Contrast between parents, mother and father roles\n(33:54) Rebellious phase, teenage peer groups\n(36:59) Run in with a dangerous creep\n(40:36) Changing the way you signal\n(45:03) How parental relationships change with maturity\n(46:39) Tricky policy gaps in Canada\n(48:24) Native intelligence breeds unique world view\n(50:00) Four dots behind the rhino\n(51:57) Mastering disparate disciplines\n(53:52) Door to door salesmanship\n(57:35) Not attempting the sale is either selfish or telling\n(1:00:27) Dating: how to introduce your career/interests in a natural way\n(1:03:52) How to sell tennis shoes, implementing the facts through a story\n(1:06:40) “Selling” is manipulation, the sale solves a problem\n(1:08:16) The Evolution Gap: between human evolution and innovation\n(1:13:46) The art of spin, relocating to England\n(1:16:40) Lawn care insurance, early business acumen\n(1:18:43) Buying “the Model Shop,” taking money from the wrong people\n(1:20:06) Difficult times and hard choices\n(1:22:04) Why “follow your passion” is not a perfect statement\n(1:24:42) Taking your pain and turning it into change\n(1:28:03) Archeology, discovering the “wild diet”\n(1:31:54) Becoming a business speaker\n(1:34:20) Tony Robbins\n(1:37:10) Testing the Wild Fit diet as a hobby \n(1:43:48) Being recognized as an “unsung hero”\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDFJJmFHmyk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDFJJmFHmyk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDFJJmFHmyk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDFJJmFHmyk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDFJJmFHmyk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":64,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pDFJJmFHmyk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"N1wlbsRxz15Aw0PZzQkQN5K2K50","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlFwamRTYmpWWmJB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-07-06T15:00:15Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"The Humorless Fundamentalists of Social Justice | Andrew Doyle | EP 373","description":"Ep. 373\n\nDr. Jordan B.

Dr. Peterson and Dr. Lindsay also discuss the Grievance Studies Affair, of which Dr. Lindsay was a co-author and which casts a spotlight on the Marxist capture of our academic and scientific institutions.\n\nAn author, mathematician, and political commentator, Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory. Dr. Lindsay is the founder of New Discourses, an organization dedicated to shining the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. Dr. Lindsay is the co-author of “Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity―and Why This Harms Everybody” and the author of “Race Marxism,” as well as, “The Marxification of Education.” Dr. Lindsay has been a featured guest on Fox News, Glenn Beck, Joe Rogan, and NPR, and he has spoken at the Oxford Union and the EU Parliament.\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nhttp://www.MoinkBox.com/JBP\n\nElysium: Get $50 off an Index test!

Gaines breaks down the breach in security that women face when forced to share vulnerable spaces with biological men, the purpose of athletic achievement, why segregation of the sexes has genuine merit, and what exactly went down at San Francisco State University.\n\nRiley Gaines is an American athlete and female rights activist. Gaines is a graduate from the University of Kentucky, where she was a twelve-time All-American swimmer. She competed and tied with trans-identifying swimmer Lia Thomas at their NCAA championships and was unfairly sidelined from the awards ceremony. She has spoken to numerous teammates and administrators who do not think this attack on female sports is fair, and more importantly, do not feel this invasion by men into female spaces is remotely safe. Gaines has become an outspoken female rights activist, advocating for the protection of women's spaces, sports, and achievements, and has proven herself unshakable even when faced with a dangerous mob.\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nhttp://www.MoinkBox.com/JBP\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Riley Gaines:\n\nWebsite: https://rileygaines.com/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Riley_Gaines_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:24) Intro\n(2:25) Riley’s credibility as an athlete\n(7:28) Obsessive dedication and unmatched discipline\n(11:49) Why ambition is not selfish\n(14:25) Grace in defeat\n(16:09) Lessons only sport can teach you\n(19:35 The necessary attributes of a team captain\n(21:47) Alignment of interest despite individual goals\n(23:23) Navigating leadership on an all female team\n(29:01) Masculine versus feminine mindset in sports\n(30:36) Why sports don’t have radical equality\n(34:09) The purpose of high level competition\n(35:23) Should any domains be sex segregated?\n(42:33) What you give up for athletic success\n(48:28) Men in women’s sports\n(53:22) Riley’s first competition against Lea Thomas\n(1:04:56) The psychology of knowing you won’t win even when you win\n(1:08:13) Derealization, and those who Lea Thomas has displaced\n(1:12:49) Lea Thomas is a narcissist\n(1:21:22) Invading the locker room, the failure of administrators\n(1:30:34) SFSU: the whole story of the viral incident\n(1:48:26) Riley Gaines will not back down\n(1:52:19) We must advocate for change\n\n\nEp.356\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #dailywireplus \n#TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08DSMeEpQyY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08DSMeEpQyY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08DSMeEpQyY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08DSMeEpQyY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/08DSMeEpQyY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":85,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"08DSMeEpQyY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2_tdWz3h3Gaq1-QxKRUL0aSLbVE","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnUxUU92dTZkNUFN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-05-08T15:15:04Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Propaganda and Your Kids | Karol Markowicz | EP 355","description":"Ep. 355\n\nTake advantage of your 7 day free trial.

Her first book, “The Beauty Myth,” would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as “The End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.” In recent years, she has come under fire for being an “anti-vaxer” and a “conspiracy theorist,” which led Wolf to write her most recent book, “The Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.”\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nElysium Health: Get 15% off sitewide!

Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Scott Jensen walk through his accomplished professional life in family medicine, as well as his successful run as a Minnesota senator, all before having his reputation in both fields dismantled for what may be purely political reasons. Six investigations across nearly five years and numerous allegations without cohesion, proof, or relation have amounted to nothing, save for the clarification of Dr. Jensen's newest goal: to take on the medical board that had no justification for its actions. Given the parallels between Dr. Jensen and Dr. Peterson’s experiences, this interview was not only inevitable but paramount.\n\nDr. Scott Jensen has practiced family medicine in Carver County, Minnesota, for 35 years. Jensen then served in the Minnesota Senate (2017-2021) and was vice-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, as well as the Republican Governor candidate in the 2022 election. \n\nHe has served many organizations as a board member or chair including the Waconia School Board, numerous Rotary and Lions clubs, several Chambers of Commerce, and bank boards. He is an avid pilot and writer, publishing his first book in 2015, “Relationship Matters” and his second book, “We’ve Been Played” in 2022.

Insanity and Parental Trauma | Miriam Grossman MD | EP 347","description":"Ep. 347\n\nWatch Jordan Peterson's \"Vision & Destiny\" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nPeterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. \n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Miriam Grossman discuss the grief and trauma associated with the Transgender movement, not just for those transitioning, but for the parents and families who now find themselves shunned and alienated if they refuse to affirm their own child's delusion. They also go into detail on the history of the ideology, the monstrosity of Dr. John Money, and his horrendous failed experiment on which he built his doctrines.\n\nMiriam Grossman MD is a physician, author, and public speaker. Before gender ideology was on anyone’s radar, she warned parents about its dangers in her 2009 book, “You’re Teaching My Child WHAT?” Dr. Grossman has been vocal for many years about the capture of her profession by ideologues, leading to dangerous and experimental treatments on children and betrayal of parents. Dr. Grossman was featured in the Daily Wire’s hit documentary “What Is A Woman?” The author of four books, her work has been translated into eleven languages. After graduating with honors from Bryn Mawr College, Dr. Grossman attended New York University Medical School.  She completed an internship in pediatrics at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, and a residency in psychiatry through Cornell University Medical College, followed by a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Grossman is board certified in psychiatry and in the sub-specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Miriam Grossman MD:\n\nLost in TransNation (Book) - https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Trans-Nation-Psychiatrists-Madness/dp/1510777741 \n\nYou’re Teaching My Child WHAT?

During his tenure, his office processed over $21B annually, and he managed 42 employees with an annual budget of over $3.5M.\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN - https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nGenucel: Use code \"JORDAN\" at checkout for additional savings on your entire purchase! https://genucel.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Derek Kreifels and SFOF:\n\nSFOF website: https://sfof.com/\n\nSFOF Twitter: https://twitter.com/SFOF_States\n\nSFOF Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/statefinancialofficers\n\nESG's Explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4XmzYj9cEY\n\nOur Money, Our Values website: https://ourmoneyourvalues.com/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:33) Intro\n(2:33) Background, the State Financial Officers Foundation\n(5:50) Free Market first\n(6:28) What a State Treasurer is responsible for\n(8:25) Trust and treasuries\n(9:36) Fiduciary responsibility defined\n(11:02) ESG’s intro\n(12:48) Environmental, Social, and Governance\n(14:15) The vision being put forward\n(17:18) Vanguard, Blackrock: the giants\n(18:04) Leveraging your money against your values\n(20:19) SFOF’s stance on ESG’s\n(23:41) The “mad rush” to abandon fossil fuels\n(27:39) The ESG movement will not work\n(28:24) The issue of poverty and human flourishing\n(29:19) Banning gas stoves, the scope of metro-products\n(30:49) Leveraging US funds for Chinese coal investment\n(32:22) To the residual environmentalists: It’s the same air\n(33:40) Why Fink bends the knee\n(35:04) Cobalt Red and covert buying\n(36:40) Conservatives have been slow to respond\n(39:08) Evil capitalists\n(40:41) CEOs, you’d have to be daft…\n(41:39) Why we typically listen to our elders\n(44:11) The top 3 ESG firms own 20 percent of the market\n(46:02) How Blackrock co-opts your funds\n(49:17) Most people don’t vote their shares\n(51:41) Weaponizing money\n(54:39) The absurd precedent set by Trudeau\n(56:19) Pushing back on IRS over-monitoring\n(58:37) 15-minute cities\n(1:00:00) Digital currency and crypto\n(1:03:11) 50 states, 50 answers\n(1:03:58) SFOF goals for Americans: divest in Blackrock\n(1:06:30) Vanguard lost 2 Billion in a year\n(1:08:04) Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive\n(1:09:59) America: a beautiful mess or progress and insanity\n(1:11:59) What you can do\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwGz8Ab2VB8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwGz8Ab2VB8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwGz8Ab2VB8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwGz8Ab2VB8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwGz8Ab2VB8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":103,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"EwGz8Ab2VB8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"I3A7-Uwx7NTwNSyRFIY8TWcrV4I","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkF5MUtWelZYYmpj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-27T15:00:07Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Parkour and Rough Play | Rafe Kelley | EP 343","description":"Ep. 343\n\nWatch Jordan Peterson's \"Vision & Destiny\" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nPeterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career.

Peterson and parkour expert Rafe Kelley discuss the importance of rough-and-tumble play for developing children, how a lifestyle centered around movement can expand our grasp and involvement with the natural world, and why society should value masculine activities, rather than adhering to the push for feminization in all aspects of modern life.\n\nRafe Kelley is an entrepreneur and advocate for a lifestyle centered around human movement. He suffered at a young age from ADHD, causing him to struggle in school. As it would happen, he came into contact with a mentor who recognized his need for play, encouraged time in nature, and taught him to productively roughhouse. This quickly resulted in Kelley advancing in his studies, launching him on his life path. In college, he studied anthropology and evolutionary biology, falling in love with martial arts and parkour along the way. He would go on to establish the first parkour gym on the west coast, Parkour Visions, before developing a new fitness lifestyle based on primal movement that Kelley calls “Evolve, Move, Play.”\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Rafe Kelley:\n\nJoin Rafe on an Evolve Move Play retreat: https://www.evolvemoveplay.com/retreats/ \n\nOr his workshops:  www.evolvemoveplay.com/workshops \n\nRafe on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rafekelley/?hl=en\n\nRafe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/rafekelley \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:57) Intro\n(3:33) Rafe’s early childhood and ADHD\n(5:18) The balance between the mother and father roles\n(7:24) Early age crisis and mentorship\n(10:57) Play and murder\n(13:00) The expansion of reflex\n(15:22) Cultural need for roughhousing\n(18:50) Provocation and response\n(22:22) Dogs need to jaw-spar\n(24:39) Why people tease each other\n(25:03) Lunch Bucket, initiating play\n(27:08) A game that scales, low resolution maps\n(30:50) Banning tag, 7 minute recess\n(33:10) Women and rough-and-tumble play\n(35:38) Identity confusion is late game exploratory play\n(38:47) Video games out-compete traditional play\n(41:39) 5 fundamental connections with the world\n(44:01) Playing with children, building confidence\n(51:10) Laughter on the deeper level, learning the rules\n(53:35) Tools and targets\n(55:30) Wrestling with god: the physical deepens the spiritual\n(57:39) Animals, play, and competence hierarchies\n(1:00:23) Rats, micro-victories and micro-defeats\n(1:04:26) Playing with a less-abled partner, self handicap\n(1:07:00) Parkour: exploratory locomotive play\n(1:09:50) The jump that calls to you\n(1:11:03) The highest obstacle is the greatest affordance\n(1:15:34) Scaling parkour down for the uninitiated\n(1:17:06) Jack White, playing on the edge\n(1:18:31) Movement variation, multi-level DNA mapping\n(1:22:41) Invoking the spirit of voluntary challenge\n(1:23:59) Hostile brothers, dueling spirits\n(1:25:34) Mapping physical and emotional courage\n(1:32:34) Evolve.

Peterson and Sara Stockton explore her past as a clinician in the field of Transgender care, how she helped co-author the processes by which gender-dysphoric children are assessed for medical intervention, and why she wholeheartedly regrets it now.\n\nSara Stockton is a licensed marriage and family therapist, lecturer, researcher, presenter, and clinical supervisor of a psychotherapy group practice in Central New York. In 2012, she co-authored and published one of the first mental health assessments utilized to assess youth's readiness to begin medical treatment for gender transition. She spent the first part of her career as a clinician treating and advocating on behalf of youth and families surrounding issues with gender. Furthermore, she spent time traveling to teach medical facilities, physicians, and schools how to provide what we now refer to as “gender-confirming” care. Treating well over one hundred families, she also wrote many of the first letters that were used to approve gender transition surgeries on minors. However, due to many concerns with the treatment outcomes and how this ideology was being presented to children, she shifted her focus away from working primarily with this population. More recently, Sara Stockton was interviewed for a documentary to discuss some of the implications of what is happening developmentally to our children. Since appearing in that documentary, Sara Stockton receives constant emails and calls from medical professionals across the globe sharing their fears about speaking out and the lack of conversation around this serious topic.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nGenucel: Use code \"JORDAN\" at checkout for additional savings on your entire purchase! https://genucel.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Sara Stockton:\n\nOn Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrsSaraStockton \n\nAisling Therapy: https://www.aislingtherapy.com/ \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:50) Intro\n(3:24) Sara’s background\n(6:09) Transgender teams \n(9:48) Two factors in gender-dysphoria\n(11:28) Lack of teaching\n(12:50) Body integrity disorder\n(14:50) Simplistic assumptions\n(15:52) Ken Zucker, clear outcomes\n(17:30) First assessments, future expectations\n(21:40) The snake pit, multi-dimensional analysis\n(23:32) Three sessions are all it takes\n(26:30) Chloe Cole: fantasy and lies\n(31:05) Four steps, no treatment\n(32:40) Meeting her first De-Transitioner\n(33:45) Tehran, bizarre ethics\n(34:50) A shallow surgical fix\n(37:28) Trans-Age, deadnaming\n(40:34) Why Sara speaks out\n(45:32) Disorienting our children\n(47:45) Misgendering considered bullying?\n(51:00) Standards of care, five senses\n(57:03) Subjective identity by the day\n(59:29) When your child dresses up to play\n(1:03:55) “Valid long-term studies”\n(1:07:00) Hysteria and cultural redefinition\n(1:09:44) Psychogenic epidemics\n(1:13:13) Counterclaims on variability\n(1:15:13) Intense body modification\n(1:19:40) The kind of people attracted to this industry\n(1:22:30) Munchausen by proxy\n(1:26:27) Oedipal narcissism\n(1:27:33) Desantis, Disney, the “LGBT agenda”\n(1:30:53) A mostly white problem\n(1:31:47) Radical freedom of choice\n(1:33:34) Furries and human sacrifice\n(1:36:30) Words of caution to therapists \n(1:39:05) Why we need to stand up now\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCH-bUFR3WM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCH-bUFR3WM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCH-bUFR3WM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCH-bUFR3WM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pCH-bUFR3WM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":105,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pCH-bUFR3WM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vxkfuxhaFB3UlNPZ9rBtllbsYR4","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkpYOUI1dG5qLXhJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-03-20T15:15:01Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Jordan Peterson Interviews Presidential Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy | EP 341","description":"Ep. 341\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nDr. Jordan B.

His Green Beret experience taught him the art of observing and surviving in the most dangerous environments on earth. Combining his skills as a writer and a photographer, and with the encouragement of fellow veterans, Michael began his correspondent career by traveling to Iraq in December of 2004. That was the first step in his nearly 20-year journey—traveling the globe to report on world events firsthand. He has traveled to more than 80 countries including China, India, Bhutan, and Vietnam studying issues from cannibalism, information warfare, insurgency, protests, migration wars, and more.

Due to the attacks on 9/11, she enlisted in the Army National Guard. In 2004, she gave up an easy re-election campaign and volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the 29th Brigade Combat Team where she served in a medical unit. After returning home in 2006, Tulsi worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to the late Senator Danny Akaka, who was Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. She then volunteered for a second Middle East deployment as a Platoon Leader.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the true cost of war, Tulsi ran for United States Congress at age 31, vowing to honor the lives and sacrifice of her brothers and sisters in uniform.

Curry is the professor Emerita and former Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She has had an accomplished career, working with NASA, the US Government, and numerous academic institutions in the field of climate change. Curry advocates for a non-alarmist approach, acknowledging Earth’s rising temperature with a grain of salt—in-field research, and a refusal to shut the doors of science to those with opposing views and findings. In 2017 Dr. Curry retired from her position at the Georgia Institute of Technology, citing “the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around man-made climate change” as a key factor. Curry co-founded and acts as president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network (CFAN), which seeks to translate cutting-edge weather and climate research into tenable forecast products.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nRefundsPro: If your business experienced shutdowns, limited capacity, supply chain challenges, or reduced revenue due to COVID, you likely qualify for Employee Retention Credit.

He has contributed to the development of theories for the Hadley Circulation, hydrodynamic instability theory, internal gravity waves, atmospheric tides, and the quasi-biennial oscillation of the stratosphere. His current research is focused on climate sensitivity, the role of cirrus clouds in climate, and the determination of the tropics-to-pole temperature difference. He has attained multiple degrees from Harvard University, and won multiple awards in his field of study such as the Jule Charney award for “highly significant research in the atmospheric sciences”.

Dr. Peterson does not teach at Ralston. \nhttps://www.ralston.ac/humanities-ma\n\nRalston College presents the inaugural lecture of its Chancellor, Dr Jordan B Peterson, delivered at one of the most iconic sites of the ancient world, the Library of Celsus in Ephesus. This ancient city was the birthplace of Heraclitus, the philosopher who first articulated the idea of the Logos, and the final resting place of St. John, who uses that same Greek word to name the Divine Word. In his lecture, Dr Peterson argues that the intelligibility of the world depends on the patterned regularities that are superordinate to our immediate perception; this underlying order - which, from the Greeks onward, we have called Logos - is both the horizon that enables human perception and the basis for the possibilities that we realize in the world. Such an account of our intrinsic, rational, and self-determining capacity constitutes a challenge to the assumptions of many prevailing schools of thought - such as behaviorism, rigid empiricism, and postmodernism - and lays the burden of personal ethics, and the formation of a good society, squarely on the shoulders of the individual.\n\n- Links -\n\nDr Jordan Peterson\nhttps://www.ralston.ac/people/jordan-b-peterson\n\nDr Stephen Blackwood\nhttps://www.ralston.ac/people/stephen-blackwood\n\nRalston College\nralston.ac\n\nRalston College Humanities MA\nhttps://www.ralston.ac/humanities-ma\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Introduction\n(3:30) Welcome to Ephesus\n(4:32) Chancellor Jordan Peterson\n(6:00) Micro and macrocosms\n(8:25) The world of what matters versus world of matter\n(11:00) That which dispels pain\n(13:36) Pattern regularities\n(21:00) Empiricism falls short, magic perception\n(25:30) System of values\n(32:15) Un-nested values\n(36:15) Story and emulation models\n(40:12) Narrative and the lens through which we view the world\n(41:50) Stalin, minions of hell\n(43:00) Divine is that which is deepest\n(44:50) Genesis, order and chaos\n(47:19) The Spirit that you walk with\n(51:00) Culture, spectacle, the kingdom of God\n(53:40) Jung, ethical endeavor\n(57:35) Truth is the antidote to suffering\n\n\nNO COPYRIGHT MUSIC FOR VIDEO, Music Link: https://www.patreon.com/no_copyrightmusic\n\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ByjCwumwBM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ByjCwumwBM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ByjCwumwBM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ByjCwumwBM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":138,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"9ByjCwumwBM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"0aNHEdIh0eK9Qn8kZN8XuQFFpes","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLllGZXBuSmpWR3JZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-23T17:05:28Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Death of the Firstborn: The Final Plague | Biblical Series: Exodus","description":"In part 6 of Jordan Peterson’s Exodus series, the table discusses chapters twelve through fourteen, specifically the significance of Passover, the importance of ceremonies, and the storyline of the Bible compared to other pieces of literature.

Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n \n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nShopify: Sign up for a free trial: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\nBlack Rifle Coffee: Get 10% off your first order or Coffee Club subscription with code JORDAN: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/\n\n\n- Links -\n\n\nFor Bjørn Lomborg:\n\nWebsite: https://www.lomborg.com/ \n\nFalse Alarm (Book): https://www.amazon.com/False-Alarm-Climate-Change-Trillions/dp/1541647467 \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(1:30) Intro\n(3:15) Symbolism of the climate cult\n(13:35) Battle for balance\n(19:17) Don’t panic\n(23:20) the Messianic urge\n(30:00) When it’s the end of the world\n(34:00) Hyper simplified moralism\n(40:00) The correct use of science\n(46:00) The better solution, delayed gratification\n(51:33) The problem with “need”\n(53:45) Wealth for the typical person\n(58:00) Imposing degrowth, inviting totalitarianism\n(1:05:00) Flawed predictions, the real fight\n(1:12:49) The wrong comparison, the right idea\n(1:19:30) Indoor air pollution\n(1:22:00) Education, double for nothing\n(1:30:03) Zone of proximal development\n(1:34:12) Ethical wealth\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OOkRJb4UbPM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OOkRJb4UbPM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OOkRJb4UbPM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OOkRJb4UbPM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OOkRJb4UbPM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":141,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"OOkRJb4UbPM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"TaePwh-xvb0926VlJ1Z8nYRB61o","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjl5M1FUWmhzR2hJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-12-16T21:27:58Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Biblical Series: Exodus | Pharaoh, Free Will, and Punishment | Episode 5 Clip","description":"Watch Exodus now, exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3XhWnHw \n\nIn Exodus Part 5, Jordan and the round table discuss chapters nine through twelve.

There she attended the University of Calgary, earning her bachelor's degree in English and economics. At this time, Smith became active in federal and provincial conservatism, and became the president of the campus PC Club. She also ran successfully for the board of trustees, and held the position for a year. After college, Smith became a columnist for the Calgary Herald. She would go on to succeed Charles Adler as host of the national current affair talk show, Global Sunday, as well as hosting two radio shows focused on health policy and property rights. In 2008, Smith left the PC party to much scrutiny, and joined the Wildrose Alliance. In the course of a year, across multiple elections, she had seen the party support base quadruple. In 2014, Smith once again joined the Provincial Conservative party, citing new leadership had been able to find common ground, with specific attention on economic standpoints. Due to this controversy, she was unable to win her next election, and opted instead to host the radio talk show CHQR, which she would later leave, along with Twitter, in response to egregious internet trolling. In May 2022, it was announced Smith would run for leadership of the United Conservative Party of Alberta, after the resignation of Jason Kenney. On October 6th, with 53 percent of the vote, she was sworn in as Premier.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n—Links— \n\nFor Premier Danielle Smith:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DanielleSmithAB/\nLinkedIn: https://ca.linkedin.com/in/abdaniellesmith\nInfo Page: https://www.alberta.ca/premier.aspx\nDonate: https://daniellesmith.ca/\n\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHelix Sleep: Get up to $200 OFF + 2 FREE pillows with all mattress orders: https://helixsleep.com/JORDAN\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nShopify: Sign up for a free trial: https://shopify.com/jbp\n\nCarZing: Get pre-qualified and find the best deals near you: https://carzing.com/jordan\n\n\n\n— Chapters —\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:30) Intro \n(3:16) Confederation of Canada\n(7:26) The energy sector in Alberta, canceled futures\n(11:20) Alberta forced to supplement eastern Canada’s economy\n(16:30) Pushing back federally for regional success\n(18:39) Simplifying the process, including the First Nations\n(20:46) Breaking the ice, the coalition of the willing\n(23:20) Fracking vs utopian moralizing\n(26:03) Climate extremism is a waste of glue\n(28:00) Greta Thunberg and the pseudo-green wave\n(31:40) The worlds’ poor are facing a dangerous winter\n(36:20) The true utility of oil, why we will never “phase it out”\n(38:54) A more profound narrative\n(41:24) We will NEVER get to one hundred percent renewable resources\n(43:11) Fascism running rampant veiled as crony capitalism \n(45:05) Small grid nuclear power\n(47:30) On the election front, Alberta\n(50:45) Energy costs drive everything, Jagmeet Singh\n(55:00) The NDP, cannibalizing their own support\n(59:45) The values of conservative Alberta\n(1:02:09) The problem with identity, cultural battleground or distraction?\n(1:05:25) LGBTQ+ and conservatism\n(1:07:16) Central planning, the fundamental flaw\n(1:11:55) Polls only sample the short term whim\n(1:14:07) Where the conservative movement has ceded ground\n(1:17:07) Polarized media results in a polarized country \n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uui-E6xdr-Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uui-E6xdr-Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uui-E6xdr-Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uui-E6xdr-Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uui-E6xdr-Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":153,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"uui-E6xdr-Q"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Qyvm88PFhzv8Jp5BNrUSDtBHyNg","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkQ1WDB0QWVjZkY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-14T17:08:04Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Tyranny in Disguise | Dr. Yoram Hazony | EP 305","description":"Dr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nDr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.\n \nDr. Yoram Hazony is an Israeli author,  philosopher, political theorist, and Bible scholar.

Most notable for his gas-tax scheme from the mid 80’s, it is estimated that Franzese at one point was personally making eight million dollars a week. At his height Franzese had achieved the rank of Caporegime, or the equivalent of a captain or general within the mob ranks, and was nicknamed the “Yuppie Don” as well as the “Prince of the Mob,” by his contemporaries. In 1986, Franzese was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy charges, and despite being released early, spent the next decade in and out of jail. In 1994 he was finally released, chose to retire from crime, and bought an estate in Florida. Since then he has traveled the world as a public speaker, and has written many books about his life and crimes, such as 1992’s Quitting the Mob, or his most recent 2022 publication, Mafia Democracy. \n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n\n—Links— \n\nFor Michael Franzese\n\nMichael Franzese on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xuh0pSLRLhzWGUnpOlvXw\nOn Twitter https://twitter.com/MichaelFranzese?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/michaelfranzese_/?hl=en\n\nMichael’s newest book, Mafia Democracy https://www.amazon.com/Mafia-Democracy-Republic-Became-Racket/dp/1544530811\n\nFranzese Wine https://franzesewine.com/ \n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold - Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n \nMasterworks - \nInvest in art today with Masterworks at http://masterworks.art/jbp.\nSee important disclosures at https://masterworks.com/cd.\n\n— Chapters —\n\n(0:00) Coming Up\n(1:23) Intro\n(3:28) Raised in the Mafia\n(11:25) Early exposure to violence\n(13:00) A father behind bars\n(14:00) The five families, Lucky Luciano\n(16:00) Racketeers and gangsters\n(18:00) The infamous gas-tax scheme\n(21:58) Keeping cool under intense pressure\n(25:15) When your father is the mob, Sonny Franzese\n(33:00) A dangerous meeting\n(43:45) Why we romanticize criminality\n(45:45) Responsibility and change\n(49:00) When Family Breaks\n(58:22) Turning points, Miami Gold Films\n(1:04:40) Love, the mafia, and God\n(1:11:30) 29 months of solitary confinement\n(1:14:00) Divine intervention\n(1:22:56) Christ and loyalty\n(1:30:24) The need for a new mindset\n(1:32:13) Showing change through action\n(1:36:27) Illegal versus immoral \n(1:39:00) White lies, living in truth\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #michaelfranseze #crime #mob #boss #mafia #newyork #NYC #manhattan","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzKM-VwriK0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzKM-VwriK0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzKM-VwriK0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzKM-VwriK0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzKM-VwriK0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":158,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RzKM-VwriK0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"21iBF2ty1KJfSLSAEv9C8i2kn_8","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnNkay1pR1NkSXhB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-31T20:01:44Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Politics: Tradition and Vision | Newt Gingrich | EP 301","description":"Dr. Jordan B Peterson and Newt Gingrich discuss the state of conservative politics, why the young generation is drawn to it now more than ever, and how across demographics, big changes are in store following the midterm elections.\n\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich is Chairman of Gingrich 360, a multimedia production and consulting company based in Arlington, Virginia.

He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”\n \nJonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world.

He would go on to be the editor of publications such as the Daily Mirror and MailOnline before ramping into a career on television. He would introduce documentaries for the BBC, and had a channel 4 political interview show with Amanda Platell, all before his stint as a judge on America’s Got Talent.

After moving to Israel, Dermer became a columnist for The Jerusalem Post and served as a close advisor to Natan Sharansky.

Governments are being forced to press their citizens, straining already fragile economic and agricultural systems, in order to appease a globalist utopian vision. Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer sit down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the faults in this plan, and the people who are suffering because of it.\n\nBjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.\n\nRalph Schoellhammer is a scholar and journalist operating in Europe who has diligently covered overlooked stories such as the Dutch Farmers Protest.

He sits down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the subject, delving into the true threat that has breached thousands of publicly funded schools.\n\nRufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Before this he was a visiting fellow for domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, as well as a Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute, and a research fellow at the Discovery Institute of Washington. In his early career, he worked in the documentary filmmaking field, where he saw first hand how impoverished communities in the United States operate, and more appropriately continue to struggle under a cycle of seemingly inescapable destitution.\n\nHe is the author of two books, “No Way Home: The Crisis of Homelessness,” and “How to Fix It with Intelligence and Humanity.” Today he publishes a show dedicated to these topics on his YouTube channel, “Christopher Rufo Theory.\"\n\nChristopher Rufo's early experiences led him to publicly stand against the rapidly growing movement we see today to teach Critical Race Theory in schools, focusing mainly on K through 12. He argues that CRT looms as “an existential threat to the United States.”\n\nWatch Christopher Rufo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/christopherrufo\n\nVisit the Manhattan Institute: https://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/christopher-f-rufo\n\nMore on Critical Race Theory: https://christopherrufo.com/crt-briefing-book/\n\nThis video is sponsored by Birch Gold.

Recorded in Dr. Peterson’s home, and prominently featuring many of Kwakwakaʼwakw carver Charles Joseph’s incredible statues and carvings, this recording may require a few complete watch-throughs. The conversation was created to intentionally dive deep into the areas of systems of perception and their impacts on our abilities to prioritize, the nature of YHWH (Judeo-Christian God), and the exploration of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. This conversation is only the beginning of many more conversations to have between these three and on these topics. Please comment any insights that you have derived from this video, my team will be paying close attention to the progress on these ideas.\n\nJonathan Pageau is a symbolic thinker, YouTuber, and class carver of orthodox icons. Jordan and Jonathan have an ongoing dialogue surrounding Judeo-Christian narrative, reality, and symbolism among many other topics.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. His work constructs a bridge between science and spirituality in order to understand the experience of meaningfulness and the cultivation of wisdom so as to afford awakening from the meaning crisis.\n\nIf you want to hear the rest of my conversation, please go to https://www.dailywire.com/watch and become a member today.

Resistance in Canada | Roman Baber | EP 273","description":"Canadian Politician Roman Baber joins Dr. Peterson to discuss the state of the Conservative Party in Canada and their approach to climate change, and the devastating hit Canada's reputation has taken at the international level.\n\nRoman Baber is a former Member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament. He is running for Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada because he will not \"sit back while Canadians are losing faith in Canada's democracy and Canadian opportunity.\" He was removed by Doug Ford from the Ontario government caucus after calling out the collateral harm of lockdowns in January 2021. Since then, Roman has been a staunch advocate in favour of a balanced covid response and in particular against lockdowns due to their toll on the health and mental health of Canadians. Roman brought legislation to cut MPP pay to CERB levels while Emergency Orders are in place, commenced and is in litigation against the Attorney General of Ontario over Canadians' right to protest and worship outdoors and recently brought a Bill to outlaw workplace mandates. Roman is passionate about and is well familiar with justice, transit and autism policy.\n\nRoman was born and lived in the former Soviet Union until he was almost 9. He then lived in Israel until he immigrated to Canada with his family at age 15 and settled in the heart of the north Toronto district he now represents. Roman obtained a BA from York University and graduated from law school at the University of Western Ontario. During his last year of law school, Roman was a supervisor with the school's legal aid funded clinic. Roman was called to the Ontario Bar in 2006 and practiced civil and commercial litigation until his election in 2018.

Bill 67","description":"A warning to citizens of Ontario and Canada: Bill 67, which purports to be nothing but an \"anti-racist\" bill, is in fact the most pernicious and dangerous piece of legislation that any Canadian government has attempted to put forward. \n\nIt will make mandatory the subversion of the entire education system in Ontario (K-12 as well as colleges and universities) to the radically leftist doctrines known as critical theory--a thoroughly anti-western ideology, both post-modern and Marxist in its derivation, based on the idea that all our extant institutions are racist, sexist and discriminatory in their essence. Critical theorists assume that history is best understood as the war between identity groups, with one group always oppressing, and all other groups always victimized and exploited. Critical theorists dismiss the idea of the sovereign, free individual, claiming that belief in such sovereignty and freedom does nothing but justify the oppression and exploitation of the marginalized. In keeping with that rejection, such theorists assume that human identity itself is best understood at the group level, with markers of race, sex, so-called gender, and sexual preference dominating. Critical theorists reject the presumption of individual innocence absent proof of wrongdoing, assuming that membership in a group regarded as dominant and exploitative is sufficient to indicate the moral culpability of any given member of that group. Critical theorists define offense and harm as subjectively determined: anyone who feels victimized by any statement made by anyone for any reason is fully justified in their feeling and claim of harm, regardless of the intent of the author of the statement, who is then to be deemed guilty of such victimization, and denied even the opportunity for a reasonable defense. Bill 67 will mandate the creation of boards of inquisition in every educational institution, to which anyone who has an opinion or undertakes an action that is perceived to violate the tenets of critical theory will be made subject to punishment. \n\nThe author of this bill, MPP Laura Mae Lindo (NDP, Kitchener-Centre), is former head of equity at Laurier University. It was Laura Mae Lindo who developed the policies that resulted in the circumstances that enveloped Lindsay Shepherd in 2017, which produced a scandal provincially, nationally and internationally, left a permanent stain on the reputation of Canadian universities, and demolished that young woman's academic ambitions and future. \n\nThe fact that the Ontario Conservative government has allowed and even encouraged such legislation to be put forward under their aegis and then ignorant and careless enough to vote in support for it is a woeful indication of both the perniciousness and deviance of the ideas that the legislation contains and evidence of their own stunning and continual inability to see the danger such doctrines present. It is much harder to actually deal with the sometimes unjust distribution of privileges and resources in a complex society than to kowtow to radicals who know how to viciously accuse, weaponize guilt, and claim through manipulative sloganeering the moral upper hand. But there is no excuse for the Conservatives and for the classical liberals who also believe in the sovereignty of the individual to trumpet their compassion for the oppressed by allowing authoritarian ideologues to gain their treacherous way. \n\nThis bill threatens the integrity of all the systems that will educate all the young people in Ontario for decades to come. The fact that it is already through second reading is inexcusable.\n\nWake up, Canadians. Before you do yourself and your children irreparable harm. \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwQy-MVP4u0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwQy-MVP4u0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwQy-MVP4u0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwQy-MVP4u0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwQy-MVP4u0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":282,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"iwQy-MVP4u0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dIUMECLwpIo9mMiRK4p1AUxoaoo","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmZvZ0dlQjhZbW5R","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-03-10T21:54:41Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Kill Bill (67) | Pardy, Haskell, Kay | EP 234","description":"This episode was recorded on 03/09/2022\n\nCanadian Bill 67, which purports to be nothing but an \"anti-racist\" bill, is in fact the most pernicious and dangerous piece of legislation that any Canadian government has attempted to put forward.

I've given that some careful consideration. You protesters have accomplished an awful lot already. The conservative leadership has crumbled. Erin O'Toole has been replaced by someone who is giving a fair bit of voice to your concerns.\n\nAll the people you represent have a voice in the house of commons. You have four provinces that have moved quite precipitously in the direction that the protest was hoping for. They are starting to lift mask mandates on something approximating as reasonable a timeline as might be expected under the circumstances. You're now faced with a difficult choice: what are your criteria for satisfaction.\n\nYou need to determine that so that you can negotiate with the necessary people. You're also faced with another danger at the moment, now that which is that the political process bent in the direction that you've insisted upon - rightly, in my estimation. This, more and more of you who are most reasonable are going to pack up and leave, or decide that this is done sometime over the next week or so (or a couple of weeks: that's obviously up to you) --, but there'll be a remnant that's much more committed in some sense to more extreme goals. That's going to be something very difficult to manage.\n\nI'd like to commend all of you for your diligence and work -- on accomplishing what you have accomplished under trying conditions -- and also for keeping your heads in a way that's been a model for the entire world. You've been able to remain peaceful. You haven't taken the bait. You haven't responded with violence to quite remarkable denigration and provocation. That's a sign of tremendous discipline and care. It's going to get more difficult to maintain as this goes along. So I hope that you're all able to allow a sufficient victory to be sufficient, to move forward without greed -- to be grateful for the effect that you've already had, and the support you've received, to move forward to a normative peace and the re-establishment of our country's economy and our psychological and social wellbeing. That's pretty much all I have to say at this point. Thank you.\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_yGvI81Oj8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_yGvI81Oj8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_yGvI81Oj8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_yGvI81Oj8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_yGvI81Oj8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":291,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"T_yGvI81Oj8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EI_1JTfFEBYyezK9q3L6u2aPZNE","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkxRd1A1ZElCZ2lN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-02-14T17:17:50Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Couples Report from understandmyself.com | Jordan & Tammy Peterson  | EP 226","description":"This episode was recorded on March 12, 2022.\n           \nIn this episode, Mikhaila, Jordan, and Tammy Peterson cover the Understand Myself Couples Report—a feature in the Understand Myself Personality Report, which you receive after both members of a compete the https://understandmyself.com process.

The interview focuses on the impact of Peterson’s work beyond the western world.\n\nMikhail Avdeev - https://linktr.ee/MikhailAvdeev\n_______________\nShownotes:\n_______________\n[00:00] Jordan Peterson is interviewed by Mikail Avdeev, a member of his foreign translations team. They begin the discussion by talking about the forming of the international translation teams.\n[02:00] The healing effect of Jordan's lectures. The outcry for new material from Jordan’s catalog of books, lectures, and podcasts has been overwhelming. \n[04:00] Espousing the profundity of Eric Neumann’s works in his “The Origins and History of Consciousness and The Great Mother.”\n[05:20] Peterson comments on another personal favorite author of his, Mircea Eliade, and his history of religious ideas - an anthropological and sociological assessment of religion that’s also deeply psychological.\n[06:40] How Russians respond to Jordan's affinity for Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Mikail details the feelings of the Russian people by their portrayal after the fall of communism.\n[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society have done: a very difficult question because we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and avoid making the same mistakes twice.\n[13:30] Examining the trope that all white people are racist; the existential guilt of history.\n[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to hold that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world (in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory) and that’s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strict rationality in the human experience.\n[24:00] Gibson’s visual perception theory. Value is the key to our perception of the world around us.\n[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience.\n[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if left unchecked.\n[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner - but that is not the rule.\n[45:45] On the importance of beauty in personal experiences as well as the collective human experience.\n[51:00] Differences between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche; closeness to the ideal of beauty\n[56:30] The complexity of the language of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. What is Jordan's process for increasing precision in writing and speech? \n[1:03:30] The divinity of the true word and the way this has been translated through Jordan’s book Beyond Order. Peterson's philosophy behind good writing and text structure of a truly complete work.\n[1:13:40] Mikhaila Peterson’s strength in the face of a great deal of suffering in her life. How wonderful it is to see her succeeding in personal endeavors like her podcast.\n[1:20:15] Fostering children’s individual growth and love of learning.\n[1:32:00] Wrapping up \n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit: \nhttps://advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":303,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Cn_lucBscH4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"AiPxabLs0Y3OVZxTI1hAH0dRxJk","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnh1M3V4MWhfY2FV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-01-13T04:07:49Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"It's Time to Live","description":"It’s mid January, 2022.

Capitalism and the free market as testing grounds for what’s actually valuable.

When a project gets delayed by the NEPA process for say 5 years, the amount of extra money spent... is enormous, it can sometimes double\" Rick Geddes\n[14:42] Gregg Hurwitz highlights the unsophisticated way the media and most politicians are currently handling the infrastructure bill\n[16:02] “It seems like we can get very little sane discussion in the media on the role that regulation plays in building a renewing infrastructure\" GH\n[16:40] Extra delay and cost in federally funded projects is a regressive tax that hurts the poor and middle class\n[22:02] Pressure on the infrastructure bill from climate change.

It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it” Jon Vervaeke\n[07:22] “Our mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure\" JV\n[09:10] “When you look at the world there is a central point of focus.

Meaning is showing itself, in a burgeoning post-secular age, as no longer only a subjective overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality itself. In this frame we come to realize that the archetypal truths are not mostly biological and mental constructs in humans; they are firstly the inescapable patterning of the indefinite potential of the world as it encounters intelligence.” \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nInterested in sponsoring my audio podcast?

The push towards central planning, implying certain people or groups know the exact consequences and solutions to future economic developments\n[29:41] \"I've been struck by the problem of unintended consequences and the irreducible complexity of things.

He's contributed as an opinion writer for the New York Times since 2013, covering politics and religion in the Muslim world.\n\nPublished by W. W. Norton, his 2011 book, \"Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty,\" presents a strong argument for Islamic liberalism. The book was long-listed for the Lionel Gelber Prize for best nonfiction book.

The benefits of a higher law on the unification of people and not deifying human rulers\n[34:59] \"There is another value in Sharia law—[it] was separate from the rulers, even above the rulers.\" - Mustafa Akyol\n[39:35] Briefly touching on the ruling class in Saudi Arabia. A brief history of the Wahhabi's rise to power, and how a group of extreme thinkers gained more power than would have been naturally possible\n[45:36] Bad Ideas from the West are, in fact, devastating\n[48:45] A modern Muslim's take on religion, power, and the birth of Islam with the prophet Muhammad\n[55:15] \"The whole thorny moral problem of what to do when you are being oppressed is not something let's say as a species we have figured out.\" - JBP\n[01:01:32] What is Mustafa's goal in studying Islam?\n[01:06:49] A study of how God's commandments are delivered as a teacher or legislator\n[01:18:51] \"The inherent problem with literalism in interpretation. The perspective of the reader creates so much of the truth in this model that they can then impose on the world around them.\" - JBP\n[01:26:20] Regarding reason and Sharia law, one group has said that Sharia indicates what's inherently right and wrong in the world. Another group, that it only creates that difference through the imposition\n[01:27:01] Mary's role in the Quran and Islamic tradition\n[01:31:29] The influence of gnostic Christian gospels on Muhammad in Mustafa's opinion.

Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU’s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nJordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.\n\nThe Jordan B.

The formation of all the foundational elements in existence.\n[1:10:00] Quantum fluctuation, quantum mechanics, quantum ground state, the resonant wavelength of electrons, and much more.\n[1:20:30] Lawrence Krauss gives his summarization of the interpretation of quantum mechanics and complexity.\n[1:25:30] Debating meaning, truth, reality, and reason in the universe. The complex and strained relationship between the scientific method and religious instinct towards our existence.\n[1:43:00] Jordan asks Lawrence to comment on the religious instinct removed by modern atheists popping up again in a politicalized form of secular humanism.\n\n#Physics #Religion #LawrenceKrauss\n\nJordan B Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist, and the author of the multi-million copy bestseller 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, and slated for translation into 50 languages.\n\nDr. Peterson has appeared on many popular podcasts and shows, including the Joe Rogan Experience (877, 958, 1006), The Rubin Report, H3H3 (#37), and many more.

Michael admits that everyone makes mistakes from time to time even the media, but it's how you handle the mistake (covering it up or admitting to the error) that makes the distinction in how he views media institutions\n[12:30] Malice outlines the specifics of 4chan for those who may not be familiar with the platform.\n[17:00] What about 4chan made it such a hospitable place for the New Right as Michael calls them. Michael defines what he views \"trolling\" to be.\n[21:30] Jordan comments that the extreme contempt he sees coming from the Left for average working-class people and to some degree the downtrodden of society.

Jordan plays the role of a defender of the patriarchy to counter. Michael outlines one of his core premises that he doesn't want others to tell him what he should inherently value.\n[1:20:30] The two debaters circle back to the engaging aspects of podcast format\n[1:25:30] Jordan revisits and tries to sum up where he feels Michaels distaste for established powers stems from.\n[1:29:30] Malice asks Jordan if he has engaged on 4chan. Michael continues to make his point that structure and corruption can not be separated from institutions. Both comment on giving people the encouragement to be a better version of themself to strive towards\n[1:36:20] Michael’s issue with the deification of the intellectual class in all aspects. Jordan gives his assessment of his time at Harvard and the people there, in the '90s at least. They continue exploring differing views on inherent corruption in politics.\n[1:51:00] The marriage of truth and humor, Malice gives an example from his book Dear Reader: The North Korea Book.

The original goal of her position at the Times was to provide a unique perspective through opinion pieces that wouldn't normally be on the radar of a typical Times reader or writer\n[6:00] Weiss writing career starting with the Wallstreet Journal before moving onto the Times\n[8:00] Jordan does a small divergence into the undergraduate experience in modern elite universities, specifically in the humanities. Bari speaks on her experience with politically directed curriculum\n[22:30] Weiss connects the experience of modern universities as her first exposure to an ideal of neo-racism that would cause her future actions as a journalist\n[30:30] A closer examination of the phrase \"Systemic Racism\" and what it typically implies for those that use it in western culture\n[44:30] Weiss talks about the beginning of her experience writing and editing at the Times. She was always the odd one out with her opinions and faced \n[55:30] Examining the attractive attributes of accepting the system of ideas associated with new systemic racism ideology. The thin veneer of society and the illogical drive to tear down what seems to be bringing the most benefit of any time in history to the poor and disadvantaged\n[1:10:00] Jordan critiques the flaw with the new atheist’s destruction of religion. People need something in their lives that is some sort of romantic adventure in their eyes\n[1:15:30] Going back to the Times. What type of journalist/editor was Weiss trying to be?\n[1:24:00] The danger of keeping quiet instead of speaking up when it's absolutely paramount to do so\n[1:34:30] What was the final turn of events that led Bari to see the Time as a place she could no longer work in good faith?\n[1:40:00] Jordan asks Weiss to comment on the generational divide he sees, should a corporation be a moral actor?\n[1:44:00] The fallout from the Tom Cotton article on bringing in the national guard during riots in 2020\n[1:51:00] The temptation of writing \"heroin\" for your readers or listeners. The cost of telling the truth and the increased cost for young unestablished people is concerning\n[2:05:00] Establishing the idea of Judgement as a necessity. How do you foster the next generation to think critically and become a good mentor instead of a tyrant to a younger mentee?\n[2:14:00] Jordan asks Bari what her plans are for the future with substack and writing/editing\n[2:21:30] Wrapping up the show.

You'll pull yourself towards them by the process of imitation.\n\nYou might think comparing yourself to someone is different than imitating, but imitating and comparing are the same thing. When you compare yourself to someone, you start pulling yourself towards them. You have to be careful you don't get envious or resentful. In some sense, by continually imitating somebody at a higher level, you're always unfulfilled. In another sense, that means you're always growing. \n\nJung believed the book of Revelations had been tacked onto the New Testament because the Christ in the gospels was portrayed too much as a figure of mercy. Whereas, in Revelations, Christ is portrayed primarily as a judge. Jung’s explanation was that every ideal is a judge. The ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge. The ultimate ideal judges your soul. The higher the ideal, the more severe the judge. That should make you quake. When your conscience assaults you in the middle of the night for things you’ve done wrong, it’s because you’re quaking in your boots, morally, because you’ve failed to live up to this ideal.\n\nPlease do not forget to subscribe to the channel in order to enjoy weekly videos.

Peterson Podcast can be found at https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\n\nMatthew McConaughey (actor, producer, and best-selling author of Greenlights) sits down with Jordan B. Peterson to talk about Matthew’s new book, his upbringing, his relationships with his mother and father, his journey to being at peace with his fame, what it’s like to play malevolent or dark characters in movies or on television, and a surprising satirical review of Greenlights. \n\nFind Matthew McConaughey on Twitter @McConaughey and on Instagram @officiallymcconaughey and basically anywhere. Check out his new book Greenlights, which has sold more than 1 million copies, available at https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson's new book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3l16Hzk\n-\nShow Notes:\n[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.\n[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.\n[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”\n[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.\n[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”\n[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.\n[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.\n[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.\n[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”\n[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.\n[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective\n[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.\n[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. \n[55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”\n[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.\n[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com/\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8wBjH8aXw4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8wBjH8aXw4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8wBjH8aXw4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8wBjH8aXw4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8wBjH8aXw4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":387,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"y8wBjH8aXw4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"nYTCgOfDh25Si03sCbR7JUhfejc","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjVTNHV3RE84X0hv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-01-06T16:14:19Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Rule 2 | Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life","description":"Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life is available for preorder at https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life\n\nThis video is part of a video series for my new book Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life.

Why has the idea of individual sovereignty been granted such primacy of place in free Western societies? Why were the men who formulated the Declaration of Independence willing to declare:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\" and, further, to insist \"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nWhy, as well, are ideas of individual sovereignty, which have proved so successful in guaranteeing freedom and prosperity in the West and, increasingly, around the world, under attack, by those on the left and the right who offer collective identity as an alternative?\n\nI'm introduced by Independent President David J. Theroux. My comments are followed by a conversation with Independent Institute Senior Vice President Mary L.G. Theroux and Executive Director Graham Walker.\n\nA public Q and A session was held a little later in the afternoon, and is available here: http://bit.ly/2HkhuUm\n\nThe Independent Institute is a non-profit, non-partisan, public-policy research and educational organization that shapes ideas into profound and lasting impact.

(Matthew 7:21, KJV). \n\nI have been asked many times by many people if I believe in God. I don't like this question. I generally respond by stating that I act as if God exists, but that's not sufficiently true. Who could do that? Who could conduct themselves with the moral exactitude and care necessary of someone who would dare to make that claim? Either claim? In any case, after being asked the question yet again, when I was in Australia, I decided to attempt to answer it in some detail. \n\nThis lecture, one of the 12 Rules for Life tour talks, was delivered in Sydney Feb 26, 2019, at the International Convention Centre. It was one of six I had professionally video recorded. Five of the six will be released directly on thinkspot, our new social media platform (to be announced in mid-June), as a bonus for direct subscribers (not to worry; there are still more than 50 to be released as audio on the Jordan B Peterson podcast at http://bit.ly/2HUdgnc, so it's not as if there will be any shortage). But I thought YouTube would be appropriate for this, given the potentially broad interest in the topic.\n\nI've made a new playlist for it, too, entitled On (my) Belief in God. Three videos make up that playlist:  this one, a 20 minute talk I did for the Prager summit in May of 2019 (https://youtu.be/vwKCK5EhibM), and an interview/discussion I had with Dennis Prager at the same event (https://youtu.be/j0GL_4cAkhI)\n\n I would recommend watching them in the playlist order, which will be this lecture first, then my Prager talk, then the interview, if you're interested in doing so. I think they make a good group.The idea of belief in God is of extreme importance. I hope that these lectures and interviews add to everyone's understanding of my position and why I hold it.\n\nAs always, thank you very much for your continued support. \n\nThe adjunct videos are also available on the Prager U site: the lecture at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avInTfCd92Q; the interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg\n\nThanks to the Prager U organization for the invitation and opportunity. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnUfXYGtT5Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnUfXYGtT5Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnUfXYGtT5Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnUfXYGtT5Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnUfXYGtT5Q/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":420,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"MnUfXYGtT5Q"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NhY9ve49HU8QmEHPRgzNnPR2GYg","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkJ3VzlRVjVVbG13","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-05-27T20:32:24Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Stephen Hicks: Postmodernism: Reprise","description":"Podcast available at (http://bit.ly/2JfN08t). \n\nI last spoke to Dr. Stephen R. C. Hicks (www.stephenhicks.org), Professor of Philosophy at Rockford University, Illinois, USA, Executive Director of the Center for Ethics and Entrepreneurship, and Senior Scholar at The Atlas Society in August of 2017 (http://bit.ly/306ggDQ), and decided that it was time for an update. Dr. Hicks received his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the University of Guelph, Canada, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He has published four books, translated into sixteen different languages:\n\n• In 1994; 2nd ed 1998 The Art of Reasoning: Readings for Logical Analysis (co-edited with David Kelley, W. W. Norton & Co., 1994, second edition 1998).\n• In 2010, Nietzsche and the Nazis \n• In 2016, Entrepreneurial Living (co-edited with Jennifer Harrolle)\n\nThe remaining book, published in 2004 and expanded in 2011, Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, has been particularly relevant to our discussions. It’s available at Amazon.com (https://amzn.to/2Jh4Uro) but also in pdf form on Dr. Hick’s website (http://bit.ly/2MaI9rH).

He’s worked in genres as diverse as pop, hip-hop, indie, dance, and more recently, perhaps, something that has come to be known as Lofi. \n\nFor reasons that have been quite surprising to me, Akira has been making lowfi tracks, also known as meaningwave, a combination of metred spoken word and music chosen for its emotional and conceptual appropriateness,  from some of my saying and my talks. They been reasonably well-listened to (although I am not sure of the standards of such things), garnering maybe a million views over the 10 or 15 or so that he has posted. The two main albums, 12 Rules for Life and JBP Wave Genesis, have elicited more than million streams each on Spotify (and that doesn’t include iTunes and other content providers of the same type). \n\nThe third album oriented around my words is entitled JBP Wave: Paradise. It was released in April of 2019. Earlier that month, Akira also released a long single, 42 Rules for Life, based on the totality of the rules I had written for Quora several years ago.  \n\nAkira has also produced similar works featuring Alan Watts, Jocko Willink (who is currently number one in the meaningwave tracks), Terrence McKenna, David Foster Wallace and Elon Musk, among others. Overall, Spotify downloads have topped 4 million, with an approximate exposure of a million. \n\nAkira the Don can be found on YouTube at http://bit.ly/2VVHOMX\n\nHere's the streaming/download links - click them to choose your preferred service:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/42rulesforlife\nhttps://fanlink.to/jbpwaveparadise\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSB7EL8VTmU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSB7EL8VTmU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSB7EL8VTmU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSB7EL8VTmU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSB7EL8VTmU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":424,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"pSB7EL8VTmU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EiUrOxaMMxdScq4Qhhq17FLxiuo","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjNwMnZvYkd0UzBN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-04-22T14:33:07Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"The Heritage Foundation: Socialism & Personal Responsibility","description":"I spoke at a Heritage Foundation event in New York City in April 2019.

Tickets for the livestream are available at https://www.jordanvsslavojdebate.com/ and also enable the debate to be viewed any time up to 30 days after purchase.  We will also place the debate, in its entirety, on YouTube after a month. \n\nI’d also like to let you know that Season 2 of the Jordan B Peterson Podcast has now started, with the first three episodes up: two 12 Rules for Life lectures, one from Seattle and one from Portland, as well as an interview with General Stanley McChrystal, retired four star general and former commander of the International Security Assistance Force and Commander, US Forces, Afghanistan. We have partnered with Westwood One (https://www.westwoodone.com), the largest audio network in the US. My daughter Mikhaila (https://mikhailapeterson.com/) is serving as co-host. This means, we hope, higher production quality, weekly delivery, and a broader reach for the podcast, which will now also be ad-supported. Jordan Peterson Videos on YouTube, which will also feature most of the podcast content, will remain unmonetized, as previously.\n\nI am going to London in May to celebrate and promote the release of the May 2 standard Penguin paperback of 12 Rules for Life into the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Indian and other international English markets (not including the US and Canada as of yet). Pre-orders of that paperback can be obtained at the Penguin website here: http://bit.ly/2ItAuRH  I’m very excited to join the great back catalog of Penguin paperbacks, which I have always loved. I’m also attending an academic conference on free speech at Oxford while in England, and subjecting myself with some trepidation to the UK press. \n\nFinally, I wanted to tell you about https://www.selfauthoring.com/ and https://www.understandmyself.com/ The first is a series of writing programs that helps people understand their past, present and future selves. The second is a personality test based on the Big Five (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, as well as the ten aspects that provide that test with higher-resolution results).

His greatest carving, a 53 foot totem pole that now sits in front of the Montreal Museum of Fine Art (see http://bit.ly/2IqLnU7), is part of the process of that repair, aided by his engagement in the unique, beautiful and profound art of his tradition. \n\nA few years ago, Charles helped me design a new third floor for my house in Toronto. We installed a number of custom totem poles and carvings on that floor, which was also a modernized version of a Kwakwaka'wakw communal big house. I used barn wood from my great-grandfather's original barn from the original Peterson homestead in Saskatchewan for the walls. It's a unique space (which I have been away from so much, given all my traveling in the last year) and it was a very engaging joint project. I learned a lot from the entire experience (which included a potlatch in Port Hardy, in the northern part of Vancouver Island). \n\nI am happy to report that most of the terrible dreams and memories that have plagued Charles for so many years have disappeared. \n \nDirector Patricia Marcoccia's Toronto-based production company Holding Space Films is currently producing a feature-length documentary film that follows our friendship.\n\nMore on Charles: http://charlesjoseph.ca/\nMore on Holding Space Films: https://www.holdingspacefilms.com/\n\nSupport: https://donorbox.org/help-us-make-films\nSign-up for updates: http://eepurl.com/dIJhdb\nTw: https://twitter.com/HoldSpaceFilms\nIG: http://instagram.com/holdingspacefilms\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/HoldingSpaceFilms\nE: letstalk@holdingspacefilms.com\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUo6Xz9asgw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUo6Xz9asgw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUo6Xz9asgw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUo6Xz9asgw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUo6Xz9asgw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":427,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RUo6Xz9asgw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"N4Fq1HCKkUAhIL5B4wFnGhgMVvA","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnF0ZmRud2JhZHZr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-31T14:46:02Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Q & A -

He was born in Toronto, and attended Humber College, and York University, prior to enrolling at Yale, where he was Program Director of the Marshal-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Program and President of the Yale Black Law Students Association.  In 2014-2015, he was an articling student at the major Toronto law firm Torys LLP. \n\nHe has also worked diligently in Toronto to improve police-community relationships, as well as holding teaching and research positions at Osgoode Hall Law School and Yale Law School.\n\nMr. Jivani is, in my opinion, a textbook case of a man who took responsibility. He came from a rough background, certainly one of comparative deprivation, and made far more of the opportunities that were still hidden there in some sense than might be reasonably expected of any man. \n\nIt seems to me that a world that had more people like Jamil Jivani in it would by anyone's standards be a better place.It was a privilege to speak with him. I hope you enjoy the conversation, and I would encourage you to pick up his book, \"Why Young Men: Rage, Race and the Crisis of Identity.\" You can get the book in Canada at Amazon.ca here: https://amzn.to/2UiPI24\n\nYou can pre-order the US version, due May 21, 2019 in the US at MacMillan at http://bit.ly/2HKqNPg\n\nI should also point out that Mr. Jivani has managed many of his remarkable achievements while suffering from a very serious illness, which we also discuss in this podcast. \n\n\n\n\nHis website can be found at https://www.jamiljivani.ca/\n\nHis podcast, The Road Home with Jamil Jivani, is available at Spotify at https://spoti.fi/2UcgpWq, at iTunes at https://goo.gl/V2FALA, as well as on the many other podcast apps popularly and commonly available.\n\nTwitter.com/jamiljivani\n \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDonations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2bFzK2EdIo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2bFzK2EdIo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2bFzK2EdIo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2bFzK2EdIo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2bFzK2EdIo/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":429,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"o2bFzK2EdIo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"r1Nk0UOJM-bgE36basbf_FmAUGc","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkNmUVpjcGFCcW80","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-03-19T00:56:50Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"March 2019 Q and A","description":"--- DESCRIPTION ---\n\nWelcome to the March Q and A with Dr. Jordan B Peterson.

Fuelled by social media, many have become trapped in reaction and ideology, yet big questions can only be explored with open-minded, self-reflective, grounded conversations.\"\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xjP4fMwdLY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xjP4fMwdLY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xjP4fMwdLY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xjP4fMwdLY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xjP4fMwdLY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":434,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_xjP4fMwdLY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"d14LJh5yQZ-k0cSDk5gr4xF0tIw","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkxkdHdnYkhCVExz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-02-28T08:19:51Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Zizek vs Peterson: April 19","description":"Presale: Code JBPSZ starts Thurs Feb 28 11:00 AM local time until Thurs Feb 28 10:00 PM. \nGeneral sales: Fri Feb 29 10:00 AM local time. \n\nhttps://www.ticketmaster.ca/event/10005659D8123C84\n\nFriday, April 19th at the Sony Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, I am debating Slavoj Zizek, Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis and, above all, for the purposes of this announcement, Marxism, are world-renowned. \n\nThe topic?

I think it is rather charitable to describe the results as distinctly unhelpful for the Peace Action group. \n\nIn this video compilation, I read part of the original press release, then present Sean’s interview with Ms. Kryzosiak, so you can make up your own minds about the opinions of her group, and follow that with an extended interview, with an audience Q and A that I conducted with Sean a day later.\n\nHope to see you in New Zealand: See www.jordanbpeterson.com for tickets remaining in the New Zealand venues: Wellington and Auckland, as well as Australia, later: Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.   \n\nSean Plunket on Twitter: @seanplunket\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XMdT2cF-ZM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XMdT2cF-ZM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XMdT2cF-ZM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XMdT2cF-ZM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XMdT2cF-ZM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":437,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4XMdT2cF-ZM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"oTcvfDga0A0tM1DzvttmGmW33-k","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlFUX2R4c1RzSHNn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-02-14T00:28:32Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Archetype, Reality, Friendship and Literature: Peterson/Hurwitz","description":"At Penguin Random House, in London, I had a recent opportunity to speak with New York Times Bestselling author Gregg Hurwitz, who has just released the latest in his Orphan X series, Out of the Dark (http://gregghurwitz.net/).

Since 2010, he has taught courses in international relations at Yale University as a Senior Fellow of the University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. \n\nGeneral McChrystal is also the the bestselling author of Leaders: Myth and Reality, described by the publisher as follows: “Leadership is not what you think it is… and it never was. Find out why in our new book Leaders: Myth and Reality which explains why leaders are important, but rarely for the reasons we think. Leaders, the follow up to New York Times bestseller Team of Teams and Wall Street Journal bestseller One Mission, profiles 13 historical leaders and reveals essential lessons on leading today.”\n\nWikipedia has the following biographical note, of some interest: “McChrystal was reportedly known for saying what other military leaders were thinking but were afraid to say; this was one of the reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan, and also the reason he was later relieved of that command.” \n\nGeneral McChrystal is also spearheading programs designed to integrated disaffected young people into responsible citizenship, including the ServiceYear Alliance (https://about.serviceyear.org/), described in the following terms:\n\n“Service years are available in a variety of focus areas, including: education, environment, disaster relief, nonprofit capacity, and many more. You can find opportunities across the country on the ServiceYear.org — our online platform that makes it easy for young people to search for the perfect opportunity. Whether you’re in high school or college, or looking to find your path — a service year gives you the chance to develop leadership and professional skills, make an impact on the lives of others, and become the active citizens and leaders our nation needs.”\n\nPerhaps this is what you’re looking for—or something you would consider supporting as a voting and communicating citizen. \n\nIt was a pleasure speaking with General McChrystal. \n\nThe Future Authoring program I mentioned, designed to help people develop a vision and a strategy for their life, can be found at https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-NfZ1j918/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-NfZ1j918/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-NfZ1j918/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-NfZ1j918/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-NfZ1j918/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":439,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"_v-NfZ1j918"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EAmNNQidbo02msnAHe5KKno334M","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLldyWkRjRWl4N3Vr","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2019-01-16T01:04:49Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Patreon Account Deletion","description":"I closed my Patreon account today, as I promised a few weeks ago (https://bit.ly/2sseihx).

Dr. Lomborg and his team have done the hard conceptual and empirical work necessary to turn good intentions for global improvement into implementable and economically efficient strategies. That's really saying something.\n \nThey have, among other things, analyzed the UN Millenial goals (169 of them, which is far too many), prioritizing and rank-ordering them in terms of practical implementability and costs and benefits.

Since 1828, our great party has played a major role in participating in the political process that has produced what is arguably the greatest republic the world has ever seen. We've produced generation after generation of leaders whom, despite their faults, have helped establish and maintain a country that has served in the main as a beacon of light and hope to the desperate masses of the world, yearning in those immemorial words to breathe free.\n\nOver those nearly two hundred years, we have all worked together, despite our differences, to produce a society where desperate want is a rarity, where hard working men and women can produce a better future for themselves and their children, and where the arbitrary disadvantages that have in the past held so many of us back and deprived others of our genuine talents have in good faith been continually reduced and minimized.\n\nNothing is perfect, and neither is our country, but we have built, together, a stable, secure, exciting dynamic community,  and can all, in consequence, look forward to an even better tomorrow.\n\nBut we, as Democrats, have faltered in our duty in recent years. We have allowed the discourse within our ranks to become increasingly dominated by a tiny, well organized and disruptive minority, who have insisted ever more stridently that our culture is a tyrannical, destructive  patriarchy, and that we are not sovereign, responsible individual citizens, capable of negotiating a shared and prosperous peace, but oppressive or oppressed minority group members, defined above all by our sex, race, ethnicity and sexual preference. \n\nWe failed, as well, to oppose the the profoundly anti-American claim that free speech is merely the means by which the powerful protect their interests, and we abandoned our invaluable commitment to and contract with the American working class, who toiled mightily and often under conditions of extreme deprivation to perform the backbreaking labor so necessary to the creation of our stellar country.\n\nIn doing so, we betrayed and insulted our primary constituency, and we squandered the opportunity to elect the first woman to the position of the Presidency of the USA. Then, instead of taking responsibility for our well-deserved failure and loss, we insisted upon vilifying those who defeated us appropriately and honestly in the honorable democratic process.\n\nWe're sorry. \n\nWe promise to return to the priorities that made our party great. We promise to build and the vital infrastructure whose construction employs our trades people and whose use is available to all. We promise to insist that our schools and those who conduct the research upon which their methods are founded abandon their divisive ideology and teach our children the knowledge and skills necessary to make them respectable, mature, productive reliable citizens. We promise, and have already taken productive steps, to reduce the inevitable corruption that tends to take hold of even the greatest and most alert of states.\n\nWe're the Democrats. We did not uphold our responsibility to the American people, and we're justly and properly sorry for that. We promise to clean our house. We promise to draw divisions between the key and time honored principles that unite us all and the divisive identity politics that is threatening to reduce us to an ignoble, squabbling and dangerously polarized tribalism. \n\nWe’re the Democrats. We hope you'll forgive us, and we promise by the sacred social compact defined by our unalienable individual rights to act responsibly and carefully and do better, together.\n\nLong may our great country prosper.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nYou may wonder why a Canadian might involve himself in such an endeavor. It's partly because everything that happens in the USA happens to us, too -- later.

Future Majority, under the leadership of Mark Riddle, continues to work on a vast scale to re-brand and define the party, particularly in red and purple states and districts, in an effort to shore up our base, speak to swing voters, and turn out those voters who we lost in the last election. \n\n\"Built Not Bought,\" created by Marshall Herskovitz, Gregg Hurwitz, and Callie Khouri, is the cornerstone of a new initiative that answers the question: What do Democrats Stand For? \n\nThe four-minute film celebrates the singular importance of working people in the creation of modern America, while calling out the big-donor influences that have eroded our democratic institutions over the past few decades. It is a patriotic, optimistic, solutions-oriented affirmation of core American values -- decency, fair-play, the belief in a boundless future -- that seem too often forgotten in our partisan era. It is a call to action, to build a future that is just and free, full of hope and opportunity.\"\n\nSee https://www.futuremajority.org/\n\nFive weeks prior to the release of Built not Bought I posted this YouTube discussion with Gregg Hurwitz (August 8, 2018):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj9NEKisvB4\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf9jBtA_LhA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf9jBtA_LhA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf9jBtA_LhA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf9jBtA_LhA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf9jBtA_LhA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":459,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"bf9jBtA_LhA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"p7i_oyXOT_PfCEYWZnGoB1TI0R0","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmVxQ05Ub3BkQkJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-09-19T14:13:53Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"The Coddling of the American Mind: Haidt/Lukianoff","description":"The Coddling of the American Mind on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2QJ20MQ\n\nConsider this book as a gift for your local school board member, teacher or principal. The more educational professionals become aware of the issues it presents, and the dangers of our current hyper-protective preoccupations, the better the chances we'll change course. \n\nI spoke with Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt September 18, 2018 about their new book, The Coddling of the American Mind -- a treatise on the counterproductive but increasingly predominant \"safety culture\" of trigger warnings, safe spaces and microaggression sensitivity. \n\nWe discussed the psychological and sociological factors that underlie this philosophy of fragility, over-protection and offense, considering the contribution of older parents, fewer siblings, the strange interaction of postmodern philosophy and Marxism on campuses, and the widespread use of social media by young people.\n\nWe focused on the increasing proclivity of those teaching in the social sciences and humanities to characterize Western culture as patriarchal and oppressive; producing, as a secondary consequence, a pervasive and all-encompassing victim/victimizer narrative (and producing that partly for the purposes of justifying that characterization). \n\nWe considered what steps might be taken, personally and socially, to produce an alternate culture of resilience, responsibility, strength and courage.\n\nHere are some links specifically relevant to our discussion: \n\nBook website: www.thecoddling.com\nWebsite of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education): www.thefire.org\nAdvice and research on free-range parenting: www.letgrow.org\n\nBooks by Greg Lukianoff:\n\nUnlearning Liberty: https://amzn.to/2Dl5WAO\nFIRE’s guide to free speech on campus: https://bit.ly/2Oz7zM7\nFreedom from speech: https://amzn.to/2QNZCV4\n\nBooks by Jonathan Haidt:\n\nThe Righteous Mind: https://amzn.to/2OCG1pl\nThe Happiness Hypothesis: https://amzn.to/2piKSkp\nAll Minus One (John Stuart Mill on free speech, illustrated): https://amzn.to/2QH1zT9\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqCNTopdBBs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqCNTopdBBs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqCNTopdBBs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqCNTopdBBs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqCNTopdBBs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":460,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eqCNTopdBBs"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"RgFYLFmckPrfxMNe9dzA3LK1J9Y","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLllmZGFBR1p2WXNB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-09-14T14:35:22Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"AD Harris/Murray/Peterson Discussion: London","description":"This is the fourth video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. \n\nSam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England. Douglas Murray joined the debate with us for the latter two occasions.\n\nVideo 1: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2OlRZUa\nVideo 2: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2CUQT0g\nVideo 3: https://bit.ly/2CUa0HG\nVideo 4: https://bit.ly/2On6Y0a\n\nSam is a well-known Enlightenment rationalist, and a prominent atheist – one of the “four horsemen,” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens (now unfortunately deceased) and Daniel Dennett. He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. \nI agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. \n\nI have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:\n\n1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-and-values-science-and-religion-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-i/\n\n2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-from-values-not-without-an-intermediary-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-ii/\n\n3. TBA\n\nA note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case.

They chose as their first recipient Saudi blogger Raif Badawi (https://www.raifbadawi.org/), who has been tortured and imprisoned for his views by the oh-so-enlightened rulers of that state. I delivered this lecture on free speech on the occasion of the acceptance of the Press Club award by Raif Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, April 26/2018 (video uploaded August 20). \n\nIt is an interesting sidenote that the Blue Metropolis Literary Festival, which held the event in collaboration with the Press Club, disavowed their support (https://twitter.com/metropolisbleu/status/976201304648355840?lang=en) because of the complaints of one Sean Michaels, as I Tweeted here (https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/984217716344094720?lang=en).

Hurwitz is currently working to rebrand the Democratic party, working to produce an issues-oriented, anti-corruption, practical mainstream narrative and to identify promising Democratic candidates who can hold their own in long form political discussions.\n\nThis is all in an attempt to end the dangerous polarization and concentration on ever more extreme ideology that seems to be destabilizing political discussion.\n\nThe video is in large part an invitation to the long-form discussion providers of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web to engage with such candidates, so that the public can see beyond the sound bites and spin and impression management and message crafting that has become an integral but pathological part of our traditional low-bandwidth media communication technology.\n\nLet's see if we can find political candidates who can shine in a three hour discussion. We're done with the oversimplifications of the traditional media forms. \n\n\nBackground: Gregg Hurwitz is the New York Times, #1 internationally bestselling author of 20 thrillers, including OUT OF THE DARK (2019), and two award-winning thriller novels for teens. His novels have won numerous literary awards, graced top ten lists, and have been published in 30 languages. Gregg has written screenplays for or sold spec scripts to many of the major studios (including THE BOOK OF HENRY), and written, developed, and produced television  for various networks. He is also a New York Times Bestselling comic book writer, having penned stories for Marvel (Wolverine, Punisher) and DC (Batman, Penguin). He has published numerous academic articles on Shakespeare, taught fiction writing in the USC English Department, and guest lectured for UCLA, and for Harvard in the United States and internationally. In the course of researching his thrillers, he has sneaked onto demolition ranges with Navy SEALs, swum with sharks in the Galápagos, and gone undercover into mind-control cults. Hurwitz grew up in the Bay Area. While completing a BA from Harvard and a master’s from Trinity College, Oxford in Shakespearean tragedy, he wrote his first novel. He was the undergraduate scholar-athlete of the year at Harvard for his pole-vaulting exploits, and played college soccer in England, where he was a Knox fellow. \n\nHe has increasingly turned his attention to the political sphere, in an effort to end polarizing discourse:\n\n·      Rebranding the entire Democratic party\n\n·      Working with a number of candidates and entities, from senators to the DNC/DCCC/DLCC\n\n·      Effort to get away from gridlock and into solutions\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj9NEKisvB4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj9NEKisvB4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj9NEKisvB4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj9NEKisvB4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nj9NEKisvB4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":469,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nj9NEKisvB4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"1uqiKX1xGugMWxQzaWGs9Xfceco","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjNWcHhKZzZqZU1v","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-08-07T01:50:09Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Q & A 2018 08 August A","description":"Hi all\n\nSelfAuthoring Code: August\nUnderstandMyself Code: August\n\nI have created a 20% discount code that works for each program: www.selfauthoring.com and www.understandmyself.com.

She also claimed that she has been rendered unemployable as an academic (a claim I believe, having served on many university search committees, and knowing full well that any whiff of scandal is enough to disquality a candidate entirely). \n\nI talked to her lawyer after reading her claim, and decided that I would also pursue Wilfred Laurier and the professors and administrators directly responsible for this debacle.\n\nI am not convinced that Wilfred Laurier learned what needed to be learned even after being dragged through the national and international press, in what was the biggest scandal that ever hit a Canadian university. \n\nMaybe two lawsuits will help rectify that. We'll see. \n\nNOTE: The allegations in these statements of claim are simply that, at this stage. They have not been tested in a court of law, and cannot therefore be considered proved. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkNv4LFpGf4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":476,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"PkNv4LFpGf4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qvyHl2QkeVaMDXWFfhhMLVlnpoE","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkZMYXFVOUxmMzlV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-06-16T15:17:04Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"23 Minutes from Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief","description":"Just released: Audiobook of Maps of Meaning: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/  \n\nI did the reading. \n\nMaps of Meaning, my first book, delves much deeper into the ideas  in my YouTube videos, podcasts and 12 Rules.

It includes elements of sacrifice (associated with delay of gratification and the discovery of the future) and psychological transformation (as movement forward in life often requires the death of something old and the birth of something new). \n\nThis five-part commentary is an attempt to explain such ideas in detail so that they can be understood, as well as “believed.”  \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPIanlF6IwM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPIanlF6IwM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPIanlF6IwM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPIanlF6IwM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPIanlF6IwM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":490,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xPIanlF6IwM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4LNtQB_7YIIQJcwsy5f1p0c5Sds","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlU0TmlqTGYzTS1B","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-04-03T16:34:37Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Australia's John Anderson & Dr. Jordan B Peterson: In Conversation","description":"I was in Australia in mid-March of 2018, speaking in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. While I was there, I had the privilege of speaking to former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson (Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/johnandersonao/), who is described accurately on Wikipedia as \"handsome, well-educated and well-spoken.\" \n\nMr. Anderson introduced one of my Australian lectures. We also had the opportunity to talk together for a few hours, and to complete this interview. We discussed many things -- responsibility, freedom, meaning in life, the polarization of viewpoints in the West, the ideological use of language and identity politics. \n\nIt seems to me that the sensible fiscal policies Mr. Anderson pursued during his governmental tenure in Australia constitute a model for good governance in the West. \n\nMr. Anderson has started a conversation series, where he discusses important philosophical, political and cultural issues.

Initial controversy over its acceptability rose to the point where the Dean of the Law School William Flanagan and Principal of Queen’s Daniel Woolf wrote missives in defence of free speech (the former: http://bit.ly/2EQJDm3; the latter: http://bit.ly/2tJB8VB). The Queen's University \"Human Rights Office\" posted a link to the Levana Gender Advocacy Centre and Education on Queer Issues Project \"active support\" efforts during this event at their “Trans-Positive and People of Colour Positive Chill-In” in Dunning Hall, room 11, where there was coloring pages, music, food, and discussion. \n\nThe 900 or so people who attended (who comported themselves admirably and thoughtfully throughout) were subject to a continual 90-minute barrage of noise generated by the protestors, who leaped up on the stained glass windows lining the hall and banged continually on them, breaking one. Inside, we could see shadowy figures dimly outlined through the colored glass. The outside doors were barricaded. One protestor was caught on film saying \"Lock them in and burn it down.\" The din was substantial and ominous, although it is much attenuated in this video, due to the nature of the microphones used, which were designed to pick up speech close at hand. \n\nThe protestor who broke the window was arrested, but not before she bit a policeman, attempted to kick the back window out of a police cruiser, and was found to be in possession of a garrotte, a particularly brutal weapon with no defensive utility whatsoever (http://bit.ly/2HoTDAu). The man who cursed so profoundly and eloquently near the beginning of the lecture accosted me and my crew after the talk, and yelled and cursed and threatened at close quarters during our 200-yard walk from the venue to the parkade.\n\nNo one who was at this event will forget it. \n\nNot good. Not good at all. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MwdYpMS8s28/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MwdYpMS8s28/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MwdYpMS8s28/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":492,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"MwdYpMS8s28"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"mV8fUWmn7_JBHbj1EumsRQojEDk","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLk9VczcyLVdxbXdJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2018-03-10T22:17:13Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Quillette: Discussion with Founder/Editor Claire Lehmann","description":"Please consider supporting Quillette’s fine work through Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/Quillette/overview\n\nI sat down recently with Claire Lehmann, founder and editor of Quillette, an online magazine that publishes essays on a range of topics related to politics, social life, science, and academia. The magazine has quickly become a highly respected outlet for open discussion of topics in psychology and the social and behavioral sciences. \n\nClaire was studying forensic psychology at the graduate level but decided that she could contribute more to the general scientific discussion as a journalist. Hence her decision to found Quillette. In this discussion, she describes the founding, development and monetization strategy underpinning her journalistic work. From Wikipedia: “The website drew significant public attention on August 7, 2017 after publishing the responses of four scientists (Lee Jussim, David P. Schmitt, Geoffrey Miller, and Debra W. Soh) to James Damore's controversial memo \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\". The website was temporarily shut down by a DDoS attack following publication of the piece.”\n\nClaire stated, during our discussion: “I didn’t think that any standard journalistic outlet would publish the material, scientific or otherwise, that I considered valuable and appropriate. The best places for scientific journalism won’t go near anything that contradicts very strong left-wing narratives such as the reality of stereotype threat (a literature severely criticized in http://bit.ly/2oVINv6), the validity of intelligence research, or the existence of sex differences in personality and interest.” I provided an extensive reference list with regard to the latter in the description for my video commentary on the James Damore/Google affair: http://bit.ly/2HmfIQ6). David Schmitt’s work (summarized here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201711/the-truth-about-sex-differences) is also relevant in this regard.  \nWe discussed the failure of psychologists to admit to, let alone identify, authoritarian tendencies on the left since the end of World War II, although there has been no shortage of work detailing those tendencies on the right. In my lab, we recently tried to rectify this with some recent as-of-yet unpublished studies making up the Master’s thesis work of my student Christine Brophy (see http://bit.ly/2eXN3m2). \n\nClaire and I also discussed the danger to women (particularly mothers) as a consequence of the social-constructionist denial of the biological differences between the sexes and the practical necessity of distinguishing between “women” and “mothers” in the economic discussion, the over-emphasis on career compared to family that is characteristic of modern life, the impossibility of a high-achieving career, in general (to say nothing of managing that with the demands of motherhood), and the failure of feminism to address that impossibility in a realistic and measured manner.\nWe close with a discussion of the fraudulent and politically-motivated misuse of the concept of implicit bias and the lack of evidence for success for anti-unconscious bias retraining programs, and consideration of the differences in competition strategies between males and females in the workplace and more broadly. \n\nOne of Quillette’s early successes, by criminologists Brian Boutwell: http://quillette.com/2015/11/13/criminologists-who-study-bio-shunned-by-field/\n\nOn the false dichotomy between sex and gender: http://quillette.com/2018/02/07/real-gender-trouble/\nAnd, in closing, on female preference for male bosses: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/549818/women-prefer-male-bosses/\n\nOnce again, please consider supporting Quillette’s fine work through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Quillette/overview\n\nAdditional relevant links:\n\nWebsite: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\n\n- Chapters -\n\n0:00) Intro\n(0:47) Before Quillette\n(1:48) Why no one would publish her articles\n(4:14) Explicit censorship \n(5:59) The corruption of social psychology\n(8:23) Crisis in academia, authoritarian teaching\n(10:12) Launching Quillette\n(14:06) Biological essentialism, Bill C16\n(17:25) Gender diffusion hurts women more\n(22:56) Downfall of the domestic sphere\n(24:42) The divine mother\n(27:58) Success means devotion and obsession\n(31:22) Feminism does not acknowledge the guilt of lost motherhood\n(36:46) Intellect across genders\n(40:11) Freedom does not mean security\n(44:09) Monetizing Quillette\n(49:54) The administrative movement and DEI\n(55:24) Mitigating lawsuit risk\n(56:36) Title 9, bending the knee is admitting guilt\n(58:22) High achieving women V.

the Kingdom of God as a psychological reality; the reality of transcendent experience; psychedelic experience; the definition of truth; Nietzsche’s critique of Christianity; trans-humanism, the singularity, life extension and the prolongation of youth; the danger of losing our humanity in technological revolution; the malleability of identity; bodily and spiritual resurrection; the nature of the persistent and transforming self; Michael’s personal transformation from areligious to evangelical to skeptic; Sam Harris; the division of the damned from the saved (or the wheat from the chaff); Ayn Rand; Jocko Willink and the utility of striving; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; the truth of fiction; postmodernism and interpretation; dragons, archetypes and intrinsic brain structure; Martin Gardner; responsibility; social ethics; the nature of belief; the collapse of free will into determinism as the future shades into the present;

Junior High, High School Students & Their Parents","description":"In this video, I make a radical suggestion, preceded by a careful, detailed argument that this suggestion is justified. \n\nIn short: I think students should (with the backing of their parents, if possible) leave their junior high and high school classes if any of the following topics arise.This means that they should stand up, note their objections to the content of the class (\"This sounds like indoctrination to me, rather than education, so I'm leaving\"), and then walk out. Perhaps they could encourage a classmate/friend to videotape their actions, and post it on YouTube. Topics warranting such a response?\n\nDiversity\nInclusivity\nEquity\n\n(Conveniently, these form the acronym DIE, which is exactly what the philosophy underpinning their grouping and use should be encouraged to do.)\n\nWhite Privilege\nSystemic Racism\nGender\n\nI am not claiming that there is nothing to be learned about such topics, or even that they shouldn’t be discussed. What I am saying is that if they are brought up in an elementary, junior high or high school classroom the odds are very high that the “lesson” to be learned will be one driven by ideological/propagandistic concerns, rather than one aimed at the inculcation of knowledge, wisdom or skill. \n\nThere will be mistakes made with such an approach. Some who discuss issues such as inclusivity and equity are going to be more reasonable than others, but that does not change the fact that the philosophy driving the pushing forward of such topics is essentially ideological and propagandistic. So I think such active resistance will get the point across very effectively. It is too bad that it has come to this, but it has. Think long and hard about it. My feeling is this: if effective action is not taken now to counteract the politicization of the public school curriculum, the need for such action will merely increase, and it will take much more to forestall the process later.

Shepherd taped the proceedings (http://bit.ly/2mMPvok) and released them, causing a national and international firestorm of outrage over the manner in which she was treated. \n\nThe video clip featured me discussing the provisions of Canada's compelled speech law, Bill C16, with Professor Nicholas Matte of the Mark S Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Shepherd was accused of breaking the law, both federal (Bill C16) and provincial, violating Wilfred Laurier's standards of conduct, and of being actively transphobic. Rambukkana compared me directly to Hitler (and Milo Yiannopoulos, to be fair), failing to recognize that what I predicted would happen in the aftermath of Bill C16 (see http://bit.ly/2AZqj4B) was exactly what was undertaken by the tripartite disciplinary panel he headed.\n\nTwenty of Rambukkana's colleagues signed a letter of support for his actions (http://bit.ly/2DiedjN), despite the almost universal condemnation. In addition, great efforts were made by the neo-Marxist/postmodernist/critical theory ideologues to cast Shepherd as the perpetrator, as noted in Quillette (http://bit.ly/2l3Np0h), and the Wilfred Laurier Faculty Association president wrote this missive (http://bit.ly/2C9Ulm1) decrying \"the violent speech and actions that have, unfortunately, become a daily occurrence on our campuses\" despite there being no evidence whatsoever for such violence. \n\nOn December 18, Dr. Deborah MacLatchy, President and Vice-Chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University, released a statement on the independent fact-finder's report on the Lindsay Shepherd affair, exonerating her completely, stating that the disciplinary meeting should have never occurred and indicating even that the claim of student complaint was essentially fabricated (although Dr. MacLatchy has released a statement of clarification about that: http://bit.ly/2C8xWWp). \n\nDr. David Haskell, Associate Professor, Digital Media and Journalism / Religion and Culture and Dr. William McNally, Associate Professor of Finance at the School of Business and Economics (both of Wilfred Laurier) joined me for this discussion (December 19), where we \"deconstructed\" Dr. MacLatchy's response. They are not alone at WLU, by the way, in their opposition to the ideological zealotry that has possessed their campus, and most others. Hopefully, in 2018, more professors will come to their senses and join them. \n\nWhy should you care? Because this is, in truth, the state of the modern university -- and what happens there will happen everywhere five years later. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWVmDSMl30s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWVmDSMl30s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWVmDSMl30s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":510,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YWVmDSMl30s"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"dK7DeAX2S5ob1y6vsv-fqMVvnn0","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkI3VjhlWjFCTGlJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-20T04:25:54Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Lecture: Biblical Series XV: Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors","description":"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nThis lecture closes the 2017 lecture series, and the book of Genesis.

He has previously worked as a lead writer at the Gothenburg Post, Hallandsposten and the Liberal News Agency. He has also worked as an editor at Axess magazine, and as editor of the  society magazine Neo. \n\nExcerpt, edited from the Google English translation of the full article: \n\n\"In a Facebook group for Jordan B Peterson's Swedish enthusiasts I ask what he means to the team members. The answers are illustrative. 'He has given me a stronger faith and a tidy student apartment I can be proud of,' writes one. 'One great thing is that he has explained the value and importance of the Bible, which is impressive considering that I'm an atheist. Meanwhile, I have listened to Jordan B Peterson I have lost 8 kg, cleaned my home (better), handled my relationships and am more effective in my job,' wrote another. A man who watches Jordan B Peterson's videos with his equally enthusiastic wife says that doing so made them both to try to become better people... Another writes: 'In addition, he got me to talk to God again, even if it is 'just' God is in my psyche.' Peterson says, 'I give public lectures in which I talk about responsibility and truth.

They say things like \"I was a nihilist, I was desperate, I was suicidal, I was destructive and bitter, but when I heard what you had to say about the myths I took myself out of the dark hole I was in.\" Person after person has been saying the same thing.

He’s not dull, for starters. Talking to him gave me the same sense of drinking from a fire hose that I experienced talking to Camille Paglia, who is one of the only people I have ever met who could give him a run for his money for sheer verbal fluency. He’s not someone whose existence you could believe in him if he wasn’t real, either. In fact, when I first heard about him, I thought “there’s just no way all those things can be true.”\nBut they are. \nHis first and longest lasting love has been science. At sixteen, he worked as a research assistant studying the immune system at the Roswell Park Memorial Research Cancer Institute. While attending NYU, he edited an art magazine, to substantial critical acclaim, then an underground rock magazine (even though he knew very little, to begin with, about rock), and then head of public relations at ABC, working for Simon & Garfunkel, Michael Jackson, the Talking Heads, AC/DC, and Bob Marley (among many others). In 1985 the acts he handled grossed a third of a billion dollars. \nHe’s also cofounded and chaired the Asian Space Technology Summit and serves on the board of the National Space Society.\nWe talked about many things: the perils of his isolated childhood, his severe bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, his interest in ecstatic collective experiences – and we barely scratched the surface. \nHe’s written six books:\nHow I Accidentally Started the Sixties (2017): an autobiographical work charting a decade of revolution and chaos:  Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2jDbZnd); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2i723lk)\nThe Muhammad Code (2016), his controversial work on Islam and terrorism: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2jCAGQz); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2i9w0RZ)\nThe God Problem (2012): how a Godless cosmos creates: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2AoZBit); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jCQ8vP)\nThe Genius of the Beast (2009), his radical revisioning of capitalism: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2Akj6uH); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2kdyWRM)\nGlobal Brain (2001), about the deep evolutionary roots of the mass mind: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2i6F2yX); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jE4GLJ)\nThe Lucifer Principle (1997), about history, biology and evil: Amazon USA (http://amzn.to/2i73rV4); Amazon Can (http://amzn.to/2jE4KuX)\n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhlL7IjaZNI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhlL7IjaZNI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhlL7IjaZNI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhlL7IjaZNI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhlL7IjaZNI/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":513,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"vhlL7IjaZNI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ErrNRRN_6Swn4kmlaIfzkimHE4o","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkRSSkt3RGZEYmNv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-11-28T01:45:42Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Lecture: Biblical Series XIV: Jacob: Wrestling with God","description":"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nIn this lecture, I present the second half of the story of Jacob, later Israel (he who struggles with God).

Intersectionality is a movement based on the observation that the standard identity groups (race and gender, for example) don't sufficiently capture the variability in oppression that characterizes those who fit into both categories simultaneously (say, black woman). I realized that the intersection of six or more categories of variation (depending on the degree of differentiation) would produce \"groups\" of only one individual. In that manner, the idea of the individual is necessarily making its comeback in the ideologies of collectivism that characterize so much modern thinking.

We believe that this sets an ominous precedent, and that such demands, if accepted unchallenged by Canadian lawyers, will quickly spread to the other professional colleges and organizations in Canada and beyond.\n\nThis video discussion is an update on what has happened since. Many articles have been written about these demands:\n\nhttps://doubleaspect.blog/2017/10/12/lawless-society-of-upper-canada/\n \nhttps://doubleaspect.blog/2017/10/19/ones-own-self-like-water/\n \nhttps://eliasmunshya.org/2017/10/23/on-diversity-inclusion-and-equality-in-the-legal-profession-my-response-to-jennifer-quito/amp/\n \nhttp://nationalpost.com/opinion/jonathan-kay-law-societys-inflated-view-of-lawyers-importance-leads-it-to-compel-speech\n \nWhy I’m ignoring the Law Society’s Orwellian dictate: http://bit.ly/2zegpu7\n \nhttp://nationalpost.com/opinion/conrad-black-lawyers-are-a-pestilence-on-society-and-theyre-predictably-turning-on-their-own\n \nhttp://nationalpost.com/opinion/bruce-pardy-law-societys-new-policy-compels-speech-crossing-line-that-must-not-be-crossed\n \nHere is a summary of the relevant issues:\n\nRecently, the Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario) has made major revisions to their requirements for the annual submission for legal practitioners in that province. As part of a five-part strategic program known as “Accelerating Culture Shift,” all lawyers are now required to write, submit and abide by a \"Statement of Principles.\" The details can be viewed here https://www.lsuc.on.ca/EDI/ -- a site which indicates what lawyers now need to “KNOW AND DO” (caps in the original) for 2017. \n\nThe content of the now-mandatory “Statement of Principles” has been dictated and will be reviewed for compliance by the Law Society itself: Acknowledgement of the “obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in… behavior towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public.” This is part of a broader claim by the same society of systemic racism endemic in the legal profession in Ontario – a claim for which very little credible evidence has been collected and distributed. \n\nFurthermore, the Society now requires every legal workplace of 10 or more licensees to “develop, implement and maintain a human rights/diversity policy” and to undergo an “equality, diversity and inclusion self-assessment for their legal workplace, to be provided to the Law Society\" (which will also “encourage legal workplaces to conduct inclusion surveys by providing them with sample templates.”)\n\nFailure to do comply brings with it the threat of serious penalties, including reputational damage and, more seriously, loss of the right to practice. \n\nBy implementing such requirements the Law Society has shifted from an organization ensuring competent practice to one dedicated to policing political and philosophical attitude and behavior. This is a clear and egregious example of compelled speech, and should be rejected as unacceptable by those at whom it is aimed. \n\nTo indicate your objections, once again (lawyers only, please, for this purpose): http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj \n\nConfidentiality is ensured.\n\nJared Brown's website and email:\nwww.brownlaw.ca\njbrown@brownlaw.ca\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPpPnGA8rkQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPpPnGA8rkQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPpPnGA8rkQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPpPnGA8rkQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPpPnGA8rkQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":524,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"FPpPnGA8rkQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"BPt-hvPbTHGUfoqo4Hb_TMT189Q","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLlJCbDVQZkE1SGZV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-16T21:05:15Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Islam--Mecca vs Medina?","description":"We discuss Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s recent paper for the Hoover Institute, The Challenge of Dawa (http://hvr.co/2xLuz6e), her conceptualization of Mecca vs Medina Islam (roughly the distinction between peaceful and militarized/expansionist), and the possibility of rapprochement between Islam and the JudeoChristian world. \n\nWe turn from that to the role the Saudis play in accommodating their radical Wahhabi clergy-- propagandizing and destabilizing Western and Islamic societies alike. Like Qatar, Kuwait and Iran, the Saudis are waging a long-term ideological war against the West, which we are too arrogant and too naïve to take seriously. \n\nWe also discuss the failure of Western women to stand up and demand that the denial of women’s rights and restrictions of freedoms that characterize those countries come to a halt—or at least that they demand that our political leaders consider that issue of utmost international importance. \n\nAli notes that Western feminists, in their obsession with European patriarchy, refuse to discuss the issues of oppression of women by non-European men outside of the West, and accept the doctrines of multi-culturalism and cultural relativism (and that such acceptance is a catastrophic for women internationally). In consequence, regarding them as more committed to their world-view than the rights of genuinely oppressed women in many non-Western countries, she does not consider them feminists at all. \n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali is the author of four books, The Caged Virgin (2004) (http://amzn.to/2xLH168), the autobiographical Infidel (2006) (http://amzn.to/2gIQVuH) and Nomad (2011) (http://amzn.to/2xJWWgk), and her latest (2015) Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now (http://amzn.to/2glwkQ2). \n\nRelevant links:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nNEW Big Five Aspect Personality Assessment: http://understandmyself.com\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBl5PfA5HfU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBl5PfA5HfU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBl5PfA5HfU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBl5PfA5HfU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBl5PfA5HfU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":525,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"RBl5PfA5HfU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Uzm-TkKF_eQW0rKOPDuP138FYRo","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLllHQzN5MUJQendB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T15:32:53Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"A Call to Rebellion for Ontario Legal Professionals","description":"Ontario lawyers/paralegals: Indicate your objection to the Law Society demands (confidentiality ensured) at http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj.

As part of a five-part strategic program known as “Accelerating Culture Shift,” all lawyers are now required to write, submit and abide by a \"Statement of Principles.\" The details can be viewed here https://www.lsuc.on.ca/EDI/ -- a site which indicates what lawyers now need to “KNOW AND DO” (caps in the original) for 2017. \n\nIn this video, I discuss this new demand (enforced by the power of government and law) with practicing lawyer Jared Brown and Professor Bruce Pardy of Queen’s University, both of whom testified, along with me, last year at the Canadian Senate on the compelled speech required by federal Bill C-16. \n\nThe content of the now-mandatory “Statement of Principles” has been dictated and will be reviewed for compliance by the Law Society itself: Acknowledgement of the “obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in… behavior towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public.” This is part of a broader claim by the same society of systemic racism endemic in the legal profession in Ontario – a claim for which very little credible evidence has been collected and distributed. \n\nFurthermore, the Society now requires every legal workplace of 10 or more licensees to “develop, implement and maintain a human rights/diversity policy” and to undergo an “equality, diversity and inclusion self-assessment for their legal workplace, to be provided to the Law Society\" (which will also “encourage legal workplaces to conduct inclusion surveys by providing them with sample templates.”)\n\nFailure to do comply brings with it the threat of serious penalties, including reputational damage and, more seriously, loss of the right to practice. \n\nBy implementing such requirements the Law Society has shifted from an organization ensuring competent practice to one dedicated to policing political and philosophical attitude and behavior. This is a clear and egregious example of compelled speech, and should be rejected as unacceptable by those at whom it is aimed. \n\nTo indicate your objections, once again (lawyers only, please, for this purpose): http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj \n\nConfidentiality is ensured.\n\nProfessor Pardy's October 12 CBC interview: http://bit.ly/2wRwamo\nProfessor Pardy's National Post article can be found at:

Times: Camille Paglia & Jordan B Peterson","description":"Dr. Camille Paglia is a well-known American intellectual and social critic. She has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where this discussion took place) since 1984. She is the author of seven books focusing on literature, visual art, music, and film history, among other topics. The most well-known of these is Sexual Personae (http://amzn.to/2xVGEEV), an expansion of her highly original doctoral thesis at Yale. The newest, Free Women, Free Men:  Sex, Gender, Feminism, was published by Pantheon Books in March 2017 (http://amzn.to/2hGycTG). \n \nDr. Paglia has been warning about the decline and corruption of the modern humanities for decades, and she is a serious critic of the postmodern ethos that currently dominates much of academia. Although she is a committed equity feminist, she firmly opposes the victim/oppressor narrative that dominates much of modern American and British feminism. \n \nIn this wide-ranging discussion, we cover (among other topics) the pernicious influence of the French intellectuals of the 1970's on the American academy, the symbolic utility of religious tradition, the tendency toward intellectual conformity and linguistic camouflage among university careerists, the under-utilization of Carl Jung and his student, Erich Neumann, in literary criticism and the study of the humanities, and the demolition of the traditional roles and identity of men and women in the West. \n \nA Facebook page is maintained for Dr. Paglia by Pantheon at Penguin Random House in New York: https://www.facebook.com/CamillePagliaAuthor    \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-hIVnmUdXM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-hIVnmUdXM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-hIVnmUdXM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-hIVnmUdXM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v-hIVnmUdXM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":529,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"v-hIVnmUdXM"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"4DQnoxfZrONEtdn7zAJ78a76N5M","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnNOYVFVdW1FaHY0","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-09-13T03:09:36Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Q & A 2017 09 September","description":"Welcome to the September edition of the Patreon Q & A.

It can be measured more accurately than anything else in the social sciences. It differs tremendously and importantly between individuals. It is the single most important determinant of life success. It's very existence, however, remains subject to substantive debate, most of it highly politicized. \n\nDr. Richard Haier has recently written a major book on the topic, The Neuroscience of Intelligence (http://amzn.to/2em55A9), summarized in the following manner: \"This book introduces new and provocative neuroscience research that advances our understanding of intelligence and the brain. Compelling evidence shows that genetics plays a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function. He dispels common misconceptions, such as the belief that IQ tests are biased or meaningless, and debunks simple interventions alleged to increase intelligence. \"\n\nWe recently spent an hour and a half talking about such things. \n\nFor more information about Dr. Haier, see: http://www.richardhaier.com/\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY4sShDt9to/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY4sShDt9to/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY4sShDt9to/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY4sShDt9to/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY4sShDt9to/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":531,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"PY4sShDt9to"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"vGRP66A7ZHW6d6pQOzv0moHIuoY","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLi15VVA0MGd3aHQw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-19T18:57:45Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Lecture: Biblical Series XII: The Great Sacrifice: Abraham and Isaac","description":"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nIn this, the final lecture of the Summer 2017 12-part series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,  we encounter, first, Hagar's banishment to the desert with Ishmael and then the demand made by God to Abraham for the sacrifice of Isaac.\n\nTo sacrifice now is to gain later: perhaps the greatest of human discoveries.

Dr. Hicks is the author of the influential and courageous 2004 book Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, which is perhaps even more relevant and important now than it was when it was published. \n\nWe spoke in depth about the history of philosophy as it has developed since medieval times, trying to understand and describe the processes that led to the rise of postmodern theory.\n\nThe book itself can be purchased here at Amazon: http://amzn.to/2icI7k1. Dr. Hicks has also made it available in pdf form here: http://www.stephenhicks.org/explaining-postmodernism/.

In fact, this theory seems to be confirmed for non-human primates (Cheney, 1983; Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 1991; Dewsbury, 1982; Gray, 1985; Maslow, 1936) and other animals from widely differing ecologies (Ellis, 1995) such as squirrels (Farentinos, 1972), cockerels (Kratzer and Craig, 1980), and cockroaches (Breed, Smith, and Gall, 1980).” Status also increases female reproductive success, via a different pathway: “For females, it is generally argued that dominance is not necessarily a path to more copulations, as it is for males. It appears that important benefits bestowed upon dominant women are access to resources and less harassment from rivals (Campbell, 2002). Thus, dominant females tend to have higher offspring survival rates, at least among simians (Pusey, Williams, and Goodall, 1997); thus, dominance among females also appears to be linked to reproductive success.”\n\nPersonality and political belief:\nGerber (2010): http://bit.ly/2hOpnHa\nHirsh (2010): http://bit.ly/2fsxIzB\nGerber (2011): http://bit.ly/2hJ1Kjb\nXu (2013): http://bit.ly/2ftDhOq\nBurton (2015): http://bit.ly/2uoPS87\nBakker (2016): http://bit.ly/2vMlQ1N\n\nOccupations by gender:\nhttp://bit.ly/2vTdgPp\n\nProblems with the measurement and concept of unconscious bias:\nFielder (2006): http://bit.ly/2vGzhQP\nBlanton (2009): http://bit.ly/2vQuwEP (this one is particularly damning)\n\nMicroaggressions: Strong claims, weak evidence: \nLilienfeld (2017): http://bit.ly/2vS28lg\n\n\nAnd, just for kicks, two links discussing the massive over-representation of the left in, most particularly, the humanities:\nKlein (2008): http://bit.ly/2fwdLrS\nLangbert (2016): http://bit.ly/2cV53Q8\n\n\nMy links:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEDuVF7kiPU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEDuVF7kiPU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEDuVF7kiPU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEDuVF7kiPU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEDuVF7kiPU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":537,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"SEDuVF7kiPU"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"_6YL10ghOO7ho4O7OXJ5byN02sg","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmFnVS1tSEZjWGR3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-09T11:46:41Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2017/08/08: James Damore and his Google Memo on Diversity","description":"This video uploaded incompletely and contains only the first 21 minutes of the full 50 minute interview (available here:  https://youtu.be/SEDuVF7kiPU)\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agU-mHFcXdw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agU-mHFcXdw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agU-mHFcXdw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agU-mHFcXdw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agU-mHFcXdw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":538,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"agU-mHFcXdw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"gGkUhXoBj3Bs_pxUtzWHnqh6d_Y","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjNZNmJDcVQ4NVBj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-08-08T12:57:59Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Lecture: Biblical Series X: Abraham: Father of Nations","description":"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nThe Abrahamic adventures continue with this, the tenth lecture in my 12-part initial Biblical lecture series. Abraham's life is presented as a series of encapsulated narratives, punctuated by sacrifice, and the rekindling of his covenant with God. This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revaluation and reconsideration of identity, prior to the next step forward. Abraham, for his part, makes the sacrifices necessary to continue to walk with God, or before God (as the terminology in this section has it). It is this decision that allows him to transcend the vicissitudes of life, and to take his role as the father of nations. \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\nSelf Authoring: http://selfauthoring.com/\nJordan Peterson Website: http://jordanbpeterson.com/\nPodcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-p...\nReading List: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/gr...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

The man portrayed in the Bible as the father of nations moves forward into the world. He encounters the worst of nature (famine), society (the tyranny of Egypt) and the envy of the powerful, who desire his wife. There is nothing easy about Abraham's life. Instead, he is portrayed both as a real man, with serious problems, and a hero, who overcomes tremendous obstacles to establish himself in the world.\n\nHis covenant with God is an Ark. His decision to aim at the highest good he can conceptualize places an aura of magic around the events of his life, despite their harshness. He's a model for life in the world as it is, not as we wish it would be.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

The history of Israel proper begins with these stories. Abram heeds the call to adventure, journeys courageously away from his country and family into the foreign and unknown, encounters the disasters of nature and the tyranny of mankind and maintains his relationship with the God who has sent him forth.  He becomes in this manner a light in the world, and a father of nations. \nHow is this all to be understood? I am attempting in this lecture to determine precisely that. How are we, as modern people, to make sense of the idea of the God who reveals himself to a personality? How can we relate the details of the Abramic stories to our own lives, in the current world? In what frame of reference can these stories be seen to make sense, and to reveal their meaning? \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah “walks with God,” as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against “the righteous anger of God.” \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel. However, it cannot be understood in its true depth without some investigation into what the motif of the flood means, psychologically, and an analysis of how that motif is informed by the order/chaos dichotomy, as well as by the idea of an involuntary voyage to the underworld or confrontation with the dragon. In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? \n\nAll that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. \n\nCain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.\n\nAbel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.\n\nThis great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

By this I mean specifically that the laudable conservative tendency to preserve the best of past has too-often manifested itself in a series of \"thou shalt not\" statements, instead of laying out a manifesto of fundamental values that might serve to unite people around a set of common ambitions. I am attempting to rectify this problem with this statement of principles, some of which I believe might have the additional virtue of being attractive to young people, looking for mature and forthright purpose and responsibility. \nI am not making the claim that the statement is perfect, comprehensive or final.\nBackground to the talk: \nI spoke at Carleton Place, a town in Lanark County, Thursday, June 15/17. I was invited by Randy Hillier, who is a Member of Provincial Parliament for Ontario (randyhilliermpp.com).  You can find out more about him here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Hillier_(politician)\n\nTenets of a viable 21st century conservatism\n\n1. The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.\n\n2. Peaceful social being is preferable to isolation and to war. In consequence, it justly and rightly demands some sacrifice of individual impulse and idiosyncrasy.\n\n3. Hierarchies of competence are desirable and should be promoted. \n\n4. Borders are reasonable. Likewise, limits on immigration are reasonable. Furthermore, it should not be assumed that citizens of societies that have not evolved functional individual-rights predicated polities will hold values in keeping with such polities.\n5. People should be paid so that they are able and willing to perform socially useful and desirable duties. \n\n6. Citizens have the inalienable right to benefit from the result of their own honest labor.\n\n7. It is more noble to teach young people about responsibilities than about rights. \n\n8. It is better to do what everyone has always done, unless you have some extraordinarily valid reason to do otherwise.\n\n9. Radical change should be viewed with suspicion, particularly in a time of radical change.\n\n10. The government, local and distal, should leave people to their own devices as much as possible.\n\n11. Intact heterosexual two-parent families constitute the necessary bedrock for a stable polity. \n\n12. We should judge our political system in comparison to other actual political systems and not to hypothetical utopias. \n\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nyw4rTywyY0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nyw4rTywyY0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nyw4rTywyY0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nyw4rTywyY0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nyw4rTywyY0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":549,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Nyw4rTywyY0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"ny_wTnbMxtdmT2hHkWx9F9TxQTE","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLklmaTVLa1hpZzNz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-06-19T22:00:24Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Lecture: Biblical Series IV: Adam and Eve: Self-Consciousness, Evil, and Death","description":"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6\n\nI turned my attention in this lecture to the older of the two creation accounts in Genesis: the story of Adam and Eve. In its few short paragraphs, it covers:\n\n1. the emergence of human self-consciousness; \n2. mankind's attendant realization of vulnerability, mortality, and death; \n3. the origin of the capacity for willful evil, as the ability to exploit that newly-realized vulnerability;\n4. the emergence of shame as a consequence of that realization;\n5. the shrinking from divine destiny that occurred when shame emerged; and\n6. the beginning of true history, with the self-conscious toil that life in history entails.\n\nImpossible. Amazing. Breathtaking. \n\nThe only story that can perhaps match it in terms of impact per sentence is that of Cain and Abel, which we discuss in the next lecture: number five in this twelve part series. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on  :)  .\n\nIn this lecture, I tried to outline something like this: for anything to be, there has to be a substrate (call it a potential) from which it emerges, a structure that provides the possibility of imposing order on that substrate, and the act of ordering, itself. So the first is something like the precosmogonic chaos (implicitly feminine); the second, God the Father; the third, what the Christian West has portrayed as the Son (the Word of Truth). \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.

Conscientiousness is the (next) best predictor, particularly in the military, in school and in conservative businesses. Agreeable people make better caretakers; disagreeable people, better disciplinarians and negotiators (within reasonable bounds). Open people are artistic, creative and entrepreneurial. Extraverts are good socially. Introverts work well in isolation. People low in neuroticism have higher levels of tolerance for stress (but may be less sensitive to real signs of danger). \n\nMatch the career you pursue to your temperament, rather than trying to adjust the latter. Although some adjustment is possible, there are powerful biological determinants of the five personality dimensions and IQ (particularly in environments where differences are allowed to flourish).\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7GKmznaqsQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7GKmznaqsQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7GKmznaqsQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7GKmznaqsQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7GKmznaqsQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":554,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"Q7GKmznaqsQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"RTX6eazfDFC4jYx78gI_XkpxTQs","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjFHU1VHX0ItbmV3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-06-02T02:17:34Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Q & A 2017 06 June","description":"This is a Question and Answer session that I set up for my Patreon subscribers (www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson)\n\nThanks very much to all 3500 of my Patreon supporters.

Why are people so inclined to engage in conflict to protect their belief systems?\n\nIt's partly because our belief systems are not only systems of belief, but structures that serve to render everyone who participates in that belief and its dramatization and acting out in the world predictable, trustworthy and cooperative (even when competing). \n\nIs there a hierarchy of rank or value among belief systems, or are they merely arbitrary? \n\nWhat is the relationship between descriptions of the objective world and moral guidelines? How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?) \n\nWhat inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society? How is all this related to the underlying symbolic structures (religious structures) that sit at the base of our societies and belief structures? \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V1eMvGGcXQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V1eMvGGcXQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V1eMvGGcXQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V1eMvGGcXQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V1eMvGGcXQ/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":557,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6V1eMvGGcXQ"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"-ykJz-tnDg4AoyigiFj88FMH-F0","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLk5lNVZiT01zUUpj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-05-24T23:21:46Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2017/04/21: A Left-Wing Case for Free Speech","description":"A few weeks ago, I went to Vancouver and delivered two talks. This is the first. I felt that it would be useful to make a case, from a left-wing perspective, for the primacy of free speech, in the pursuit of avowedly left-wing goals. Free speech is an issue of such primary importance for the maintenance of our culture that it is foolish to assume that it is somehow naturally allied only with centrist or right-wing political agendas. In fact, I think a case can be made that such freedom is even more important for the genuine left (a political movement or position that can validly speak for the relatively powerless) than for partisans of any other position.\n\nSo I made that case in this address.

About 300 people were turned away for lack of space. \n\nThe rest of the discussion is at the National Gallery of Canada YouTube site here: http://bit.ly/2oTKCpg\n\nThanks to Marc his staff (who I won't name here) for making this happen. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-dYktgmNUg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-dYktgmNUg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-dYktgmNUg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-dYktgmNUg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-dYktgmNUg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":570,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"k-dYktgmNUg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"YsQtdMUBH25sOJdkefAoXOiEkK8","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjdYdEVadkxvLVNj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-04-28T03:03:29Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2017 Maps of Meaning 10: Genesis and the Buddha","description":"In this lecture, I discuss the creation stories in Genesis, the first book of the Bible, and describe the parallels with the stories of the development of the Buddha from childhood to early adulthood, using the archetypal schema developed previous in the course. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XtEZvLo-Sc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XtEZvLo-Sc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XtEZvLo-Sc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XtEZvLo-Sc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XtEZvLo-Sc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":571,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"7XtEZvLo-Sc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"jrVmtlss58y9wjA2nijlw33OBI8","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnFSLTQ3OWVVQ2tJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-04-22T00:15:58Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2017/04/21: Disinvited to Linfield College: My response","description":"In February of 2017, I was invited to speak at Linfield College (http://www.linfield.edu/), a small liberal arts institution in McMinnville, Oregon, about an hour outside of Portland.

These categories include the individual (hero/adversary), culture (wise king/tyrant), and nature (destruction/creation). The heroic individual (the knower) is typically masculine, as is culture (the known), while the unknown is feminine. These categories can be conceptualized, as well, as explorer, explored territory, and unexplored territory. The most abstract category is the dragon of chaos, the monster who guards what is most valuable. It is from this most primordial of categories that the other three emerge. Our existence as prey and predator is reflected in the ambivalent representation of the absolute unknown.\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3n5qtj89QE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3n5qtj89QE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3n5qtj89QE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3n5qtj89QE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3n5qtj89QE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":589,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"F3n5qtj89QE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"siFubSeW-U3ZfHL2D1K3iP8F6r4","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmhKNEpFeXBOSDJz","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-03-04T17:03:19Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Dialogue: Great U Texas Austin Psych Prof JW Pennebaker","description":"Podcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/episode-11/\n\nDr. James W. Pennebaker is Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Executive Director of Project 2021, aimed at rethinking undergrad education at that university.\n\nI first encountered Dr. Pennebaker's work when I was working  on the SelfAuthoring Suite (www.selfauthoring.com), an online writing program which has helped thousands of college students stay in school and get better grades. He conducted the original work on \"expressive writing,\" starting in the 1980's, showing that people's health and productivity improved when they wrote about traumatic experiences or uncertainty -- particularly if they constructed causal accounts or plans. He has also investigated the psychological significance of patterns of word use (particularly about everyone's favorites, pronouns). We talk about all of this, and much more.\n\nDr. Pennebaker's books include:\n\n\"Opening Up by Writing it Down\" http://amzn.to/2mQX09L\n\"Expressive Writing: Words that Heal\" http://amzn.to/2m6eIWP\n\"The Secret Life of Pronouns\" http://amzn.to/2lqfRvu\n\nYou can find out more about The SelfAuthoring Suite, which helps people write about the difficulties and uncertainties of the past (Past Authoring), present (Present Authoring) and Future (Future Authoring) at www.selfauthoring.com.

We frame the world -- or the world reveals itself to us -- as a story, with a starting point, a destination, and the behavioral means to move from one to the other. The destination is valued more highly than the starting point, and constitutes the point of the story -- the aim of the individual. Reality manifests itself within that story as what is relevant for forward movement, what gets in the way, and what is irrelevant and can be safely ignored. The largest category, by far, is the latter. Unfortunately, sometimes what has been happily classified as irrelevant rears up and gets in the way. That's a manifestation of chaos. Chaos can undermine the story, or break the frame. The degree of undermining or breakage is proportional to the time and space over which the story in question extends its operations.\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsZ8XqHPjI4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsZ8XqHPjI4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsZ8XqHPjI4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsZ8XqHPjI4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nsZ8XqHPjI4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":596,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nsZ8XqHPjI4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"UYe_Qapdksi1xHM8KVjWaqen_CI","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLndLT25Kc3h3VGJJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-02-19T22:43:12Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Author Gregg Hurwitz","description":"Gregg Hurwitz is a New York Times Bestselling author and creator of Evan Smoak of Orphan X and The Nowhere Man.

What is belief? Why is it so important to people? Why will they fight to protect it? I propose that belief unites a culture's expectations and desires with the actions of its people, and that the match between those two allows for cooperative action and maintains emotional stability. I suggest, further, that culture has a deep narrative structure, presenting the world as a forum for action, with characters representing the individual, the known, and the unknown -- or the individual, culture and nature -- or the individual, order and chaos. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8Xc2_FtpHI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8Xc2_FtpHI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8Xc2_FtpHI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I8Xc2_FtpHI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":614,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"I8Xc2_FtpHI"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EGXEQV62NmyVV--TRvW7dAigXEw","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLkl4YzlpMUc3ZWV3","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-01-04T03:26:55Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"The Metaphysics of Pepe with Jonathan Pageau","description":"Because frogs need to grow up and transform into princes....

The organizers of this event sent me the following statement: \n\n\"Many university students' core beliefs and ideas are challenged by the courses they take, with no meaningful and beneficial replacements being proposed.  This creates a devastating problem for many students. They experience a crisis of meaning, and no longer know or can't tell what they should pursue in life. This existential undermining adds to the stress students experience while attempting to maintain a good GPA and manage demanding courses. All of this can produce depression, and encourage a nihilistic outlook.\" \n\nThis discussion addresses such issues. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dvmUTeZvl6I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dvmUTeZvl6I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dvmUTeZvl6I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dvmUTeZvl6I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":627,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"dvmUTeZvl6I"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"oh3hUQZl-Rh8ENwMrriFspr6WFI","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmxYWTVzYW9nd2hn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-07-15T19:25:29Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Live Q&A Practice Run","description":"This session was recorded on July 13th in anticipation of Dr. Peterson's live Q&A event, which will take place on July 21st,  8:30pm Eastern/5:30pm Central.

The commonalities include the idea of a paradisal, enclosed space; the disruption of that space by anomalies associated with mortality; and, in the final analysis, the idea of enlightenment or identification with the divine as medication for tragic self-consciousness. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F7T5cg1a77A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F7T5cg1a77A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F7T5cg1a77A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":631,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"F7T5cg1a77A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"2NwUzD4WjRt_N5DECaP5bULLpPo","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnExNWVUeVNuV3hj","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-04-01T19:28:33Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2016 Personality Lecture 13: Conscientiousness: Industriousness and Orderliness","description":"Conscientiousness is the best predictor of long-term life success across multiple domains (including academic and managerial/administrative performance). It breaks down into two aspects: industriousness and orderliness. Industrious people are hard-working, attentive and focused. Orderly people like things where they belong, and are concerned with preserving the integrity of the borders between things. We don't know much about the psychological basis of industriousness. Orderliness, however, appears to be associated with disgust sensitivity, with the \"behavioral immune system,\" and is in all probability elevated in geographical locales where infectious disease is prevalent. It is also a good predictor of political conservatism. When disgust sensitivity gets out of hand, too much cleansing (ethnic and otherwise) becomes increasingly possible. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q15eTySnWxc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q15eTySnWxc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q15eTySnWxc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q15eTySnWxc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":632,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"q15eTySnWxc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"Tu4s1XYJFPSnHTSWt3hx7YLPPp8","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLnFSRnh1bHZSQzdJ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-03-29T23:55:11Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2016 Personality Lecture 14: Openness and Intelligence","description":"Openness to Experience is the final Big Five trait to be discussed in this series of lectures.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, this presumption is simply incorrect. In fact, the reverse is true, insofar as social engineering is concerned: the personality and other differences between men and women MAXIMIZES instead of minimizing in exactly those societies that have moved closest to the egalitarian ideal (the Scandinavian countries). This is because those countries have eradicated most of the environmentally-produced variation in these traits, leaving only those that are genetic to manifest themselves.

We're all horrified by these things - yet they always seem to be with us. The human thirst for atrocity is at the heart of what psychologist Jordan Peterson has to say, in a talk he gave at the Stratford Festival, and in conversation with Paul Kennedy. Part of the answer lies in John Milton's great poem, Paradise Lost. It turns out Milton had a lot to say about our appetite for violence 350 years ago.\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/a-history-of-violence-1.2994267 \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support:

end and blunt stubbornness, even callousness on the other. Women are higher in the former, men in the latter. Those differences are largest in the MOST not the LEAST egalitarian societies, in direct contradiction to the social constructionist, neo-Marxist and radical feminist claims. Conservatives are higher in politeness, a form of social convention, than liberals. Liberals are higher than conservatives in compassion. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:

Personality Lecture 08: Depth Psychology: Sigmund Freud (Part 1)","description":"Sigmund Freud was the great synthesizer and advocate of the ideas of the unconscious. He gave motivational factors such as lust and aggression primary places in the human psyche, and helped give clear formulation to the idea that the human psyche was made up of oft-conflicting subpersonalities. Furthermore, he was a clear observer of the pathology of the too-close, dependent family, and a great observer of and guide to dreams. For all these reasons, academic psychologists tend to hate and denigrate his achievements. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise:

Canada currently protects 1.1% of its oceanic territory while the United States of America protects 29.4% and Australia 27.9%(1). Marine Protected Areas allow fish stocks to grow in a safe environment. Without them, fish stocks can be incessantly trawled without regenerating. The lack of oceanic protection is compromising the fishing industry, which currently employs 120 000 people(2) and exports $4.1 billion (CAD)(3) worth of goods every year.\n\nThe Atlantic Cod Fisheries have already collapsed. It was once one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Before 1960, 300 000 tonnes of cod were landed annually on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland(3). However, there was no oceanic protection. In 1992, over 99% of the historical biomass was depleted(4). Widespread unemployment and poverty ensued with 40 000 people in the fishing industry losing their jobs(5).\n\nCanada has repeatedly promised to protect its oceans. In 1995, Canada signed the UN Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing Operations. In 2001, Canada signed the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. These treaties explicitly detail the necessary procedures to preserve fish stocks by protecting the oceans. Since then, other countries have established substantial Marine Protected Areas. Yet, only 1.1% of Canadian oceans are protected.\n\nThe University of Toronto Marine Life Advocacy is deeply concerned about the lack of oceanic protection in Canada. Marine Protected Areas are not just economic necessities, but simultaneously offer environmental and sociological benefits.

Personality Lecture 17: Agreeableness and gender differences","description":"There are moderate  differences in personality (and larger differences in interest) between men and women, statistically speaking, although the overlap is large, trait by trait. Agreeableness is one trait where relatively large differences exist. Associated with compassion and empathy, agreeableness is generally viewed in a positive ethical light, although there are very many ethical advantages to behavior characterized by the opposite pole. Agreeable people can easily be taken advantage of, for example -- something that happens less frequently to their disagreeable counterparts. There is also good evidence that the gender differences in personality and interest maximize, rather than minimizing, as cultures become more egalitarian. This is partly because egalitarian cultures eliminate variance in social influence, allowing the genetic differences to emerge as paramount. This is good if you think people should be allowed or even encouraged to be who they are, but not so good if you think any differences are unnecessary and bad. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yOJR-nEhNMk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yOJR-nEhNMk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yOJR-nEhNMk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":729,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"yOJR-nEhNMk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"iP8mWP1-XgxShZpTVWPou1UzKGo","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLmRZVEF2N2VRLXZn","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2014-03-13T04:17:50Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"2014 Personality Lecture 16:  Extraversion & Neuroticism (Biology & Traits)","description":"Extraversion and Neuroticism are two of the Big Five Personality traits identified through statistical means in the last forty years.

Full version also in the playlist, may be watched through a proxy server or a virtual private network. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFMy8uGJLQA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFMy8uGJLQA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFMy8uGJLQA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WFMy8uGJLQA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","playlistId":"UUL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","position":746,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WFMy8uGJLQA"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Jordan B Peterson","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"qrlNwGOahp4Mu-S6hQQkKhx8A7w","id":"VVVMX2Y1M1pFSnhwOFR0bE9rSHdNVjlRLjJjM20wdHQ1S2NF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2013-05-18T04:23:45Z","channelId":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","title":"Reality and the Sacred | TVOntario | #1","description":"This public lecture, recorded by TVO, describes the way the world is portrayed in deep stories, such as myths and religious representations. The world in such stories is a place of action, not a place of things, and it has its archetypal characters, positive and negative. Culture is typically represented as paternal, nature as maternal, and the individual as hero and adversary. Culture offers people security, but threatens them with tyranny. Nature offers renewal, but also brings death. The religious path of meaning allows people to negotiate this archetypal landscape. \n\nPodcast link: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcasts/podcast-episode/episode-1/\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL
