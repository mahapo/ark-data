proportion of men who are completely childless in any given generation is far higher"},{"startMs":1836570,"durationMs":2469,"subtitle":"than the proportion of women who are."},{"startMs":1839039,"durationMs":6421,"subtitle":"So you see an element of expendability in males, and that’s typical across the biological"},{"startMs":1845460,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"community, because you don’t need as many males as you need females in order to keep"},{"startMs":1848840,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"the population moving forward."},{"startMs":1852080,"durationMs":3870,"subtitle":"And one of the things that happens as a consequence of that, at least in principle, is that males"},{"startMs":1855950,"durationMs":5630,"subtitle":"are more behaviourally variable and variable across a lot of dimensions, than females are."},{"startMs":1861580,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"And that’s a plus, because they’re more variable on the upside, but it’s also negative"},{"startMs":1865899,"durationMs":3211,"subtitle":"because they’re more prevalent on the downside."},{"startMs":1869110,"durationMs":4629,"subtitle":"Now there’s some substantial argument

beings."},{"startMs":1878019,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"One potential implication is that although women and men have equivalent IQs, the standard"},{"startMs":1884739,"durationMs":1510,"subtitle":"deviation is slightly different."},{"startMs":1886249,"durationMs":4410,"subtitle":"Which means that there are more males who are

population"},{"startMs":1919769,"durationMs":5071,"subtitle":"and you were trying to guess who was the more aggressive of the two, most of the time, you"},{"startMs":1924840,"durationMs":5350,"subtitle":"know about 60% of the time, the male would be more aggressive than the female, but 40%"},{"startMs":1930190,"durationMs":1260,"subtitle":"of the
