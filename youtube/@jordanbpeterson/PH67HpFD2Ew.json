things I want to tell you about"},{"startMs":13540,"durationMs":1300,"subtitle":"I want to tell you"},{"startMs":15240,"durationMs":740,"subtitle":"Uhm"},{"startMs":18060,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"I want to give you a schema that is going to enable you to understand"},{"startMs":21180,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"I think it will enable you to understand stories"},{"startMs":24220,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"Like the one I told you last time, you remember Jonah and the whale"},{"startMs":28140,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"I want to provide you with the schema so you can understand stories like that"},{"startMs":34240,"durationMs":1720,"subtitle":"But many many more stories like that"},{"startMs":36640,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"Partly what I am telling you about today"},{"startMs":39100,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"In some sense are archetypes"},{"startMs":41900,"durationMs":8540,"subtitle":"And an archetype, it is an idea that was made most popular over the last 100 years by Carl Jung"},{"startMs":50780,"durationMs":1240,"subtitle":"But it's a much older idea than that"},{"startMs":52500,"durationMs":1580,"subtitle":"It's really a platonic idea in some ways"},{"startMs":54260,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"And it means something like fundamental pattern"},{"startMs":57780,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"And so an archetype manifests itself in different ways"},{"startMs":60500,"durationMs":2040,"subtitle":"It could be a pattern of emotional response"},{"startMs":62540,"durationMs":1400,"subtitle":"Like it can be something you are feeling"},{"startMs":63940,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"It could be the way that emotional response displays itself"},{"startMs":67060,"durationMs":1640,"subtitle":"On your body, on your face"},{"startMs":68900,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"It could be the way that emotion feels and displays itself on your face"},{"startMs":74980,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"And plays itself out as a drama in your local environment"},{"startMs":79840,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"So like an angry argument is an archetypical phenomenon"},{"startMs":83400,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"And the reason it's archetypical is because"},{"startMs":85540,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"Well, you have them, you have them, you have them, you have them, everyone has them"},{"startMs":93160,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and so you can't really think about them as individual, you have to think about them as universal"},{"startMs":97080,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"and you can't think as about something that you created in a sense"},{"startMs":100560,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"although, in a sense you do"},{"startMs":102320,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"but it's also as something that happens to you"},{"startMs":104960,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"now, when you read about Jung and archetype is quite confusing because you can never be sure"},{"startMs":110520,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"whether it's talking about an instinct, an emotion, a motivational system, or a sub-personality"},{"startMs":118120,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"or a sub-personality in which these things manifest itself, or even the social drama that's being played out"},{"startMs":124480,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"in time and space in the social world"},{"startMs":126720,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"but a real archetype I would say is all of those things at the same time."},{"startMs":130160,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"Now, we use archetypal means of expression to represent how we act"},{"startMs":135960,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"And that's not the same thing as we think representing what the world is made out of"},{"startMs":140340,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"It's a very different thing, so you could say in some sense we tell stories and understand stories"},{"startMs":144820,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"so that we can figure out how people act and how they should act"},{"startMs":148060,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"and then we conduct science so that we can figure out what the world's like"},{"startMs":151520,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"from a material objective perspective and"},{"startMs":154660,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"the two things coexist uneasily"},{"startMs":156820,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"I think the more primary form of knowledge is actually how to act with a scientific model nested inside"},{"startMs":163220,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"because the most important question you have to solve as a living organism isn't what the world is made out of"},{"startMs":168700,"durationMs":1880,"subtitle":"it's how you should act in the world"},{"startMs":170580,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"say from a darwinian perspective even"},{"startMs":173040,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"so that you can live long enough to reproduce."},{"startMs":175960,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"that's basicly from a strict biological perspective"},{"startMs":179720,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"in some sense that's what you have to do in order to be successful"},{"startMs":183960,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"it's kind of obvious"},{"startMs":185320,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"first of all 'cause you are not very successful if you just go and die"},{"startMs":187920,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and then, of course, death from a genetic perspective and failing to leave offspring are much the same thing"},{"startMs":197280,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"Now, one of the questions might be"},{"startMs":201800,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"how is that we conceive of the world as a place to act in"},{"startMs":206960,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"and that's partly I'm gonna tell on the hypothesis for you and then explain the significance of that hypothesis"},{"startMs":214400,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"and the hypothesis involves the description of what you might consider consitituent elements"},{"startMs":221040,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"and also transformation processes"},{"startMs":224560,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"as far as I can tell, the constituent elements of the stories that we tell"},{"startMs":229960,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"about how the people act and should act are characters"},{"startMs":232800,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"Now that makes sense, right, because you really can't have a drama or story without characters"},{"startMs":238120,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"Now, the thing is that characters have to be understandable"},{"startMs":241840,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"and so, for them to be understandable they sort of have to be like you"},{"startMs":245640,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"or they have to be like someone you know, but they have to be human"},{"startMs":249080,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"but than again it's not exactly that they're human, because"},{"startMs":252400,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"even when you're telling a story about what happened to you today"},{"startMs":256920,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"it's interesting to think about what you do"},{"startMs":260320,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"so someone might say \"well, how is your day?\", and you say \"fine\""},{"startMs":265040,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"i mean, maybe it's the lowest level, lowest resolution highest abstract srory"},{"startMs":270480,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"\"my day was fine\""},{"startMs":272080,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"It's pretty boring story, it's better then terrible, I suppose"},{"startMs":275360,"durationMs":1800,"subtitle":"it's not interesting, it's not detailed"},{"startMs":277280,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"but person gets the notion that things went according to plan"},{"startMs":283380,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"or, more specificly, that things unfolded the way you wanted them to"}]
