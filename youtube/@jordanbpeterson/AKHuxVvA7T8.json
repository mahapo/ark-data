that,"},{"startMs":3252020,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"and so what that means in some sense is that you can view everyone who disagrees with you as a source of potential

your suffering and perhaps, learning to be - how to be a greater use to people around you, which again, seems to be nothing but for the good."},{"startMs":3490260,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"So

concept,"},{"startMs":3531860,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"because I don't believe it does, but you see, you are a certain way and some of that way is an error"},{"startMs":3539720,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and then when you learn that an error has taken place, you have to let go of the conceptions that produced that error,"},{"startMs":3546760,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"and that could be very, very painful."},{"startMs":3549240,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"For example, you may have entered into a relationship that was pathological,"},{"startMs":3554100,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"and you know it's pathological but you're hooked into it and you're emotions are hooked into it and you've configured you life around it"},{"startMs":3559820,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and then in order to move forward, you have to let go of that, you have to admit to all the errors you made"},{"startMs":3565460,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"including the time that was wasted and you have to allow a large part of yourself to die,"},{"startMs":3571380,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"let's say, and you experienced that in grief and misery and sorrow and anxiety and sleepless nights and all of that,"},{"startMs":3578540,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"but it's better than dying completely,"},{"startMs":3582440,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and what that indicates is that every time you learn something, large or small,"},{"startMs":3588120,"durationMs":8380,"subtitle":"the part of you that was in error prior to obtaining that bit of information has to deteriorate and disappear."},{"startMs":3596500,"durationMs":2040,"subtitle":"There's pain associated with that."},{"startMs":3598540,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"But then there's the possibility for regrowth and transformation,"},{"startMs":3604960,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and one of the most fundamental decisions that human beings made in their lives is whether or not they're going to identify with what they are or with what they could be,"},{"startMs":3611960,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and if they identify with what they could be, then they have to continually let what they are die"},{"startMs":3617220,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so that what they could be can come forward."},{"startMs":3620880,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"And so to learn is to die voluntarily and be born

place."},{"startMs":3640680,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"I think of the discussions that I've had with my wife and my kids, but primarily with my wife,"},{"startMs":3648600,"durationMs":1680,"subtitle":"who's a very honest person,"},{"startMs":3650840,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"in fact, I don't - I've been married for 28

things that I'm talking to you about tonight,"},{"startMs":3673420,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"and I told her that if we were going to be together,"},{"startMs":3679620,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"that she would have to tell the truth because if she didn't tell the truth and I wouldn't know who she was,"},{"startMs":3683600,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"and I wouldn't know where we were, I wouldn't be able to solve any problems and neither would she,"},{"startMs":3689420,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"cause we'd be living a fictional relationship with one another, and that struck me as a very bad idea."},{"startMs":3694880,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And so, she took that to heart,"},{"startMs":3697540,"durationMs":1100,"subtitle":"I would

spectacularly morally virtuous in any particular manner, and I'm quite aware of my multitude of faults,"},{"startMs":3714480,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"but the fact that she has gripped so tightly onto the truth means that if I ever have a problem,"},{"startMs":3720720,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"that I can talk to her and I know what she thinks."},{"startMs":3723840,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"And she doesn't tell me that she's right, we've learned that,"},{"startMs":3726280,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you know, because to tell someone the truth does not mean to claim that you're correct,"},{"startMs":3731120,"durationMs":9220,"subtitle":"It only is to claim that you're trying to communicate the way things look to you as clearly as possible and that you're open to the possibility of correction."},{"startMs":3740340,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"Right? Because if someone can tell you how you're wrong, precisely,"},{"startMs":3744300,"durationMs":2140,"subtitle":"exactly how you're wrong, that's such a gift,"},{"startMs":3746440,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"and if someone is willing to tell you the truth, then you have the possibility of learning from them,"},{"startMs":3751200,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"and then you have two brains instead of one."},{"startMs":3753960,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"And that's a good deal and that's actually the spiritual purpose of marriage"},{"startMs":3757940,"durationMs":7700,"subtitle":"I'd say - it's to produce an union between two people that's predicated upon the truth so that the information flow between them can maximize,"},{"startMs":3765900,"durationMs":10980,"subtitle":"and so that they can both be elevated above the restrictions of their own solitary biased existence."},{"startMs":3776880,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"And that facilitates, that produces the proper environment for children,"},{"startMs":3781700,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"because then the children don't face the father or face the mother, they face union of the father and the mother,"},{"startMs":3788520,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"and that's an invaluable force and the children will attempt to play one person off against the other"},{"startMs":3795340,"durationMs":8980,"subtitle":"because they're tricky, because they're human and they're full of trouble and they're very good that poking and prodding and manipulating and investing"},{"startMs":3805200,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"but they want to get a wall, they want to get a wall that doesn't move because that makes them secure"},{"startMs":3811680,"durationMs":1420,"subtitle":"and if you have a relationship that's based on truth,"},{"startMs":3813100,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"then you can talk about how it is that you should be with your children, for example, and you can agree upon it,"},{"startMs":3818800,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"and then when the children push the limits as they inevitably will, they don't find something spongy, decayed and weak"},{"startMs":3825580,"durationMs":7640,"subtitle":"they find something that's strong and sturdy and it's a wall and, of course, they can't through the wall, that's frustrating"},{"startMs":3833220,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"but then they're protected by the wall and that stops them from being anxious beyond their capacity to bear."},{"startMs":3840080,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"And so that structure that's brought about by truthful communication builds the walls around children that allow them to play freely"},{"startMs":3847580,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and expand themselves and exist properly in the world."},{"startMs":3851360,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and so, speech must be untrammeled so that dialogue can take place,"},{"startMs":3855880,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"means that, well if you talk to me I want to know what you think."},{"startMs":3860060,"durationMs":10060,"subtitle":"I don't say I'll agree with it and if you disagree with me, I'm going to fight with every bit of power at my disposal to determine who is

right,"},{"startMs":3886440,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"so I'm going to hit you with everything I've got, but part of that is also in hope that if I'm
