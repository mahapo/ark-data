Now we have very old rituals and we have very"},{"startMs":825500,"durationMs":6490,"subtitle":"very old stories. And so, part of what we do in this course is we go back to as close"},{"startMs":831990,"durationMs":5339,"subtitle":"to the beginning as we can possibly manage to start to understand how people have understood"},{"startMs":837329,"durationMs":5961,"subtitle":"themselves and represented themselves across the span of human history.

You know I’m sure you’ve heard in many classes"},{"startMs":859829,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"that much of what makes up your personality is a cultural construct. Well, whether or"},{"startMs":866029,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"not much of it is or not isn’t really the issue. Certainly some of it is, and an important"},{"startMs":870009,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"part—you’re a cultural creature.

And so what that means in part is that if you don’t understand"},{"startMs":888410,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"your history, and that’s your history as it matters, not necessarily some collection"},{"startMs":895490,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"of facts, then you don’t understand yourself.

More or less biologically or genetically identical"},{"startMs":908750,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"creatures to us existed at least 150 000 years ago but we seem to have discovered fire and"},{"startMs":915250,"durationMs":5259,"subtitle":"were able to master it maybe 2 million years ago.

And there are artifacts that indicate a fairly high level of cultural capacity"},{"startMs":930920,"durationMs":5669,"subtitle":"that are at least 50 000 years old.
