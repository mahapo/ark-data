we"},{"startMs":139760,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"have language, there’s a reasonable probability that we’ve encapsulated the structure of"},{"startMs":145360,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"human

talk"},{"startMs":313330,"durationMs":4630,"subtitle":"about that a bit later, but, because they tried to throw out evaluative words like good"},{"startMs":317960,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"and evil for example—those aren’t in the big five—so they tried to only use adjectives"},{"startMs":323560,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"that didn’t necessarily seem to be, like, valued or devalued."},{"startMs":330000,"durationMs":4950,"subtitle":"So introvert and extrovert, well, they’re opposites, but is it better to be an introvert?"},{"startMs":334950,"durationMs":2290,"subtitle":"Is it better to be an extravert?"},{"startMs":337240,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"Well, it’s not obvious so all the words that cover that

theory"},{"startMs":347940,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"wanted to keep it as free of values as possible."},{"startMs":351040,"durationMs":2180,"subtitle":"Now that’s already a hypothesis

if you eliminate all the words that are clearly valenced."},{"startMs":363000,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"And we did an experiment here a while back that was pretty interesting."},{"startMs":367420,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"We got hold of a data set of descriptive adjectives and we put all the evaluative words back in."},{"startMs":373000,"durationMs":9990,"subtitle":"So, like nasty and horrible and awkward and cruel, and then the good words as well: moral,"},{"startMs":382990,"durationMs":3030,"subtitle":"pleasant, uplifting, all those things."},{"startMs":386020,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"And then we had people rate people they liked and people they didn’t like using that expanded"},{"startMs":390840,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"list and we got a real archetype in some sense of the hateable person and a tremendous number"},{"startMs":396640,"durationMs":3830,"subtitle":"of the words that were used came from the evaluative dimension."},{"startMs":400470,"durationMs":4330,"subtitle":"So I think that when you throw out the evaluative words you actually throw out a lot of what"},{"startMs":404800,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"people actually use, descriptive words to describe, because when you like someone or"},{"startMs":409630,"durationMs":5330,"subtitle":"don’t like someone, if someone’s likeable or unlikeable that’s a pretty important"},{"startMs":414960,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"phenomena."},{"startMs":415960,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"I mean, you hang around the people you like generally speaking and you don’t

later because there’s reasons that happened and the reasons"},{"startMs":428580,"durationMs":3470,"subtitle":"were valid, and it’s not that easy to fix it."},{"startMs":432050,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"And besides that, the standard five factor model has all sorts of utility."},{"startMs":436090,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"But you need to know what its strengths are and its limitations are."},{"startMs":440530,"durationMs":4770,"subtitle":"Now, hypothetically, what you do to draw out the five factor model was you take,

those"},{"startMs":451060,"durationMs":4830,"subtitle":"descriptive adjectives, so that it’s not biased—you’re not going to use all of"},{"startMs":455890,"durationMs":3690,"subtitle":"them because, you know, if you asked someone to describe themselves on a questionnaire"},{"startMs":459580,"durationMs":4790,"subtitle":"using all the adjectives we have to describe personality they’d be there for like a day."},{"startMs":464370,"durationMs":1080,"subtitle":"And so that’s not every efficient."},{"startMs":465450,"durationMs":2630,"subtitle":"And so you want to take a random sample."},{"startMs":468080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Maybe you only sample the words that people are most likely to use."},{"startMs":472080,"durationMs":4170,"subtitle":"So for example if you go online you’ll find that there are word frequency tables."},{"startMs":476250,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"You know, most of your language, about 500 words covers about 80% of what you say."},{"startMs":484650,"durationMs":5290,"subtitle":"You know, and I don’t remember what the lexicon of the typical person is, I think"},{"startMs":489940,"durationMs":5110,"subtitle":"it’s in the neighbourhood of 3500 words, but that might be wrong, but there’s like"},{"startMs":495050,"durationMs":1960,"subtitle":"750,000 words in the English language."},{"startMs":497010,"durationMs":4090,"subtitle":"It’s an omnivorous language, it just pulls words in from all over."},{"startMs":501100,"durationMs":6050,"subtitle":"And so we hardly use any of those words, and you know, there’s ones that are used extraordinarily"},{"startMs":507150,"durationMs":1220,"subtitle":"infrequently."},{"startMs":508370,"durationMs":4250,"subtitle":"So what you could do is you could look at the total set of adjectives and then you could"},{"startMs":512620,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"pull out, you know, identify the ones that are used,, you know, the thousand most frequently"},{"startMs":518360,"durationMs":4149,"subtitle":"used words and that’d probably cover 95% of the territory, and then you can pick out"},{"startMs":522509,"durationMs":2031,"subtitle":"a random set of 100."},{"startMs":524540,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"Then you could administer it to people, and then you could factor analyze

some sense, or the easiest"},{"startMs":541769,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"measure or maybe the best represented in language or something like that, it’s extraversion"},{"startMs":545610,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"versus introversion."},{"startMs":547870,"durationMs":4699,"subtitle":"And the extraversion is a positive emotion dimension."},{"startMs":552569,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"And it’s associated with enthusiasm and assertiveness."},{"startMs":560129,"durationMs":3971,"subtitle":"And assertive people will say, they’ll dominate the conversation with language."},{"startMs":564100,"durationMs":4599,"subtitle":"Or, well basically that’s the way to think about it."},{"startMs":568699,"durationMs":3242,"subtitle":"Enthusiastic people, they’re up for anything, you know, they’re the ones they’re always"},{"startMs":571941,"durationMs":1688,"subtitle":"smiling

people."},{"startMs":578519,"durationMs":4351,"subtitle":"So they’re happy, they’re gregarious, they’re assertive, they’re enthusiastic,"},{"startMs":582870,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"they’re noisy, they blink more than introverts—now why that is I have no idea, but apparently"},{"startMs":587589,"durationMs":1291,"subtitle":"they do [student laughter]."},{"startMs":588880,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"So if you notice someone blinking a lot you can assume that they’re extroverts."},{"startMs":595300,"durationMs":4099,"subtitle":"If they’re not conscientious , you know there’s this idea of people being impulsive,"},{"startMs":599399,"durationMs":4971,"subtitle":"it’s a very badly defined term so when you hear a psychologist

they’re"},{"startMs":607660,"durationMs":3729,"subtitle":"talking about because probably there’s no such thing as impulsivity."},{"startMs":611389,"durationMs":8110,"subtitle":"But extraverted people who are not very conscientious tend to--that's one of the things you might"},{"startMs":619499,"durationMs":2001,"subtitle":"think about as associated with impulsivity."},{"startMs":621500,"durationMs":5499,"subtitle":"There's all sorts of other things though to, so--okay there's a positive emption dimension"},{"startMs":626999,"durationMs":5001,"subtitle":"and that's extraversion and there's a negative emotion dimension and that's neuroticism."},{"startMs":632000,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"And neuroticism seems to break down into something like withdrawal and volatility."},{"startMs":636300,"durationMs":1909,"subtitle":"And volatile people are touchy."},{"startMs":638209,"durationMs":4641,"subtitle":"So, you know, they'll react quite a lot if something negative happens."},{"startMs":642850,"durationMs":3950,"subtitle":"So if you tease them they might get upset or if you start fighting with them in a sort"},{"startMs":646800,"durationMs":4670,"subtitle":"of provocative way instead of sort of calming everything down, they'll just ramp it up."},{"startMs":651470,"durationMs":4210,"subtitle":"And if there's two of you that're volatile and you're having a conversation and the conversation"},{"startMs":655680,"durationMs":4690,"subtitle":"goes a little bit, you know, into unpleasant territory, you can really get each other going."},{"startMs":660370,"durationMs":1519,"subtitle":"So, yes?"},{"startMs":661889,"durationMs":6061,"subtitle":"Student: \"Is it like, in terms of the hero, like internal

you"},{"startMs":4289401,"durationMs":1349,"subtitle":"know."},{"startMs":4290750,"durationMs":4850,"subtitle":"You can feel the pattern, you can build a three-dimensional representation of it, you"},{"startMs":4295600,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"can really see well with your eyes--it's like the idea that blind people can't see is a"},{"startMs":4299120,"durationMs":1010,"subtitle":"really dopey idea."},{"startMs":4300130,"durationMs":1560,"subtitle":"They can't see colour."},{"startMs":4301690,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"And they're not very good at detecting things in the distance."},{"startMs":4304510,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"But they have a visual world, it's just built out of things that don't have colour."},{"startMs":4308310,"durationMs":5010,"subtitle":"You know perfectly well that that's the case because I can hand you an object and you could"},{"startMs":4313320,"durationMs":3750,"subtitle":"fiddle around with it behind your back and after some fiddling around you'd know exactly"},{"startMs":4317070,"durationMs":1550,"subtitle":"what it looked like."},{"startMs":4318620,"durationMs":3619,"subtitle":"And you know you might pull it out here and say , well I didn't know it was blue."},{"startMs":4322239,"durationMs":4001,"subtitle":"It's like, yeah okay, you didn't know it was blue, but you still saw it."},{"startMs":4326240,"durationMs":3470,"subtitle":"And you get pretty god-damn good vision with your ears."},{"startMs":4329710,"durationMs":3449,"subtitle":"So there are kids who're blind who've learned to echolocate."},{"startMs":4333159,"durationMs":4341,"subtitle":"So they go click-click-click, they don't make that noise exactly, but they do click [clicking"},{"startMs":4337500,"durationMs":3530,"subtitle":"sounds] and they can detect the clicks bouncing off of things."},{"startMs":4341030,"durationMs":2930,"subtitle":"And they can do that well enough, not only to walk, but some of them can actually ride"},{"startMs":4343960,"durationMs":1250,"subtitle":"bikes."},{"startMs":4345210,"durationMs":4710,"subtitle":"It's like, hey that's impressive, man."},{"startMs":4349920,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"Yeah, there's one kid--I saw a kid on youtube who's blind who could shoot baskets, yeah,"},{"startMs":4354880,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"which is--that's impressive, man."},{"startMs":4357360,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"But my point is that a lot of the neural tissue is--it'll take whatever input it gets."},{"startMs":4363440,"durationMs":5730,"subtitle":"So if you're born blind, your auditory systems will invade your visual system."},{"startMs":4369170,"durationMs":3069,"subtitle":"And then you have twice as much brain devoted to your hearing."},{"startMs":4372239,"durationMs":3031,"subtitle":"So, and then you know, you can use that quite effectively."},{"startMs":4375270,"durationMs":4550,"subtitle":"So I think we're probably pretty much out of time."},{"startMs":4379820,"durationMs":3339,"subtitle":"One thing I want to tell you before we go on to the next part though is that--so now"},{"startMs":4383159,"durationMs":5270,"subtitle":"we've sort of built up the idea of these underlying motivational systems."},{"startMs":4388429,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"And now you can kind of see how they work, so you might say to yourself, why didn't you"},{"startMs":4394909,"durationMs":3971,"subtitle":"see the gorilla and the curtain and the person leaving."},{"startMs":4398880,"durationMs":2779,"subtitle":"It's really complicated, it's really complicated."},{"startMs":4401659,"durationMs":6331,"subtitle":"Well, the first answer is, you did what I asked."},{"startMs":4407990,"durationMs":1720,"subtitle":"And then you might ask, well why?"},{"startMs":4409710,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"Why did you do what I asked?"},{"startMs":4410710,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"I mean you missed the damn gorilla, right."},{"startMs":4412610,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"It's like, obviously that wasn't a very good decision."},{"startMs":4415670,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"So you think, well why did you do what I asked?"},{"startMs":4418110,"durationMs":5390,"subtitle":"And the answer would be--well, it's sort of like the Milgram obedience experiment except"},{"startMs":4423500,"durationMs":2110,"subtitle":"at a way lower level."},{"startMs":4425610,"durationMs":2650,"subtitle":"It's like, we've got an agreement going on here."},{"startMs":4428260,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"You guys are all very sophisticated and complex game players, otherwise you couldn't sit here"},{"startMs":4434300,"durationMs":1820,"subtitle":"peacefully for an hour and a half."},{"startMs":4436120,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"So you're very well socialized, all of you."},{"startMs":4439300,"durationMs":6050,"subtitle":"And so that means you've organized all your motivations into a hierarchy, and that hierarchy"},{"startMs":4445350,"durationMs":1310,"subtitle":"is guiding your behaviour here."},{"startMs":4446660,"durationMs":3831,"subtitle":"It might be something like, well we need to learn something and hypothetically, you come"},{"startMs":4450491,"durationMs":1099,"subtitle":"here and you learn something."},{"startMs":4451590,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"And so you're playing that out."},{"startMs":4453650,"durationMs":6339,"subtitle":"And because that's the motivational state that you're in, when I ask you to do something,"},{"startMs":4459989,"durationMs":1421,"subtitle":"you're just going to do it."},{"startMs":4461410,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"Well then, what's so cool is that as soon as you decide to point your attention at something,"},{"startMs":4469690,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"what you see in the world radically transforms."},{"startMs":4472230,"durationMs":4610,"subtitle":"So I say, well count the basketballs and all of a sudden all you can see are basketballs."},{"startMs":4476840,"durationMs":2290,"subtitle":"And you think, no no, I see--I'm not blind."},{"startMs":4479130,"durationMs":3250,"subtitle":"It's like well, you're pretty damn blind."},{"startMs":4482380,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"And so, that's partly how you can understand how motivation is a sub-personality."},{"startMs":4488840,"durationMs":2220,"subtitle":"Like it has its whole sets of perceptions and values."},{"startMs":4491060,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"It's like, all of a sudden, I set you up in a little motivated state--it was a complicated"},{"startMs":4496179,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"one--but it was just like, here's a task."},{"startMs":4499380,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"And so you're all motivated, you're going to do the task properly, for god only knows"},{"startMs":4503780,"durationMs":5310,"subtitle":"how many reasons, and then all of a sudden, all that exists in the world are basketballs."},{"startMs":4509090,"durationMs":8730,"subtitle":"And so, it's as if your goal-directed attention has transformed the phenomenology of the world."},{"startMs":4517820,"durationMs":5230,"subtitle":"And that's something that's really cool because one of the things it implies is that what"},{"startMs":4523050,"durationMs":3150,"subtitle":"you see of the world depends on what you're aiming at."},{"startMs":4526200,"durationMs":2690,"subtitle":"And in a real sense--this isn't some trivial sense."},{"startMs":4528890,"durationMs":4849,"subtitle":"It means like literally what you're aiming at--I'm going to count the basketballs--it"},{"startMs":4533739,"durationMs":2771,"subtitle":"means, well you're not noticing the gorillas."},{"startMs":4536510,"durationMs":3459,"subtitle":"So one of the things that you might ask yourself, and this is partly what the phenomenologists"},{"startMs":4539969,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"were on about is, what're you aiming at?"},{"startMs":4543989,"durationMs":5351,"subtitle":"And what is it that what you're aiming at allows you to see, and what is it that what"},{"startMs":4549340,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"you're aiming at blinds you to."},{"startMs":4551860,"durationMs":3250,"subtitle":"And it blinds you to a lot more than it allows you to see."},{"startMs":4555110,"durationMs":3589,"subtitle":"And so another thing that you can think about is like, if everything you see makes you angry"},{"startMs":4558699,"durationMs":7161,"subtitle":"and bitter and resentful, you might think, well hmm, what exactly am I aiming at that's"},{"startMs":4565860,"durationMs":2690,"subtitle":"making the world organize itself around me in that manner?"},{"startMs":4568550,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"And that would be a complex, for a Jungian perspective."},{"startMs":4574250,"durationMs":1329,"subtitle":"A complex would do that."},{"startMs":4575579,"durationMs":4421,"subtitle":"So it's a set of values, they're sort of economist, they inhabit you, it's a sub-personality,"},{"startMs":4580000,"durationMs":3199,"subtitle":"it's quite complex, it's got something it's aiming at."},{"startMs":4583199,"durationMs":3861,"subtitle":"You might not even know what that is because you're acting it out instead of understanding"},{"startMs":4587060,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"it."},{"startMs":4588060,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"And because you're inside of it, it lays the world out for you in a particular way that"},{"startMs":4592860,"durationMs":4819,"subtitle":"makes the world look like it's showing you that what you think is right."},{"startMs":4597679,"durationMs":6621,"subtitle":"But if you're--what do they say-- to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."},{"startMs":4604300,"durationMs":3770,"subtitle":"And that's one of the things that's so damn cool about that experiment."},{"startMs":4608070,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"It's like, really?"},{"startMs":4609590,"durationMs":1609,"subtitle":"I'm really that blind?"},{"startMs":4611199,"durationMs":5681,"subtitle":"I can miss something that radical just when I'm involved in some dopey task like counting"},{"startMs":4616880,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"basketballs it makes me so blind that it's almost beyond comprehension."},{"startMs":4621000,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"Well, so in some ways you skip between different states of blindness."},{"startMs":4626280,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"A lot of them are biologically motivated."},{"startMs":4628520,"durationMs":4369,"subtitle":"And you turn those into a hierarchy and that's sort of your higher value system and then"},{"startMs":4632889,"durationMs":4341,"subtitle":"that thing points you at something, and the whole world lays itself out around that."},{"startMs":4637230,"durationMs":4630,"subtitle":"And the way it does it is divides the world into irrelevant things--and so those would've"},{"startMs":4641860,"durationMs":4629,"subtitle":"been the curtains in this particular example, or the gorilla or even the player in black"},{"startMs":4646489,"durationMs":4261,"subtitle":"who left the game--irrelevant, because it didn't interfere with you counting."},{"startMs":4650750,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"So what you look at makes most of the world irrelevant."},{"startMs":4654010,"durationMs":2790,"subtitle":"It makes some things , things that serve you."},{"startMs":4656800,"durationMs":2310,"subtitle":"And that makes you feel positive emotion."},{"startMs":4659110,"durationMs":2379,"subtitle":"And it makes other things things that get in your way."},{"startMs":4661489,"durationMs":2191,"subtitle":"And that's what makes negative emotions."},{"startMs":4663680,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"And so you've got the hypothalamic systems that point you in biological directions."},{"startMs":4668030,"durationMs":6570,"subtitle":"You organize those, and then, as you're approaching the things you're aiming at, the positive"},{"startMs":4674600,"durationMs":3749,"subtitle":"emotion systems tell you you're on track and the negative emotion systems tell you when"},{"startMs":4678349,"durationMs":1401,"subtitle":"something's interfering."},{"startMs":4679750,"durationMs":3530,"subtitle":"And those are actually different neurological systems."},{"startMs":4683280,"durationMs":1730,"subtitle":"So they're not in the hypothalamus."},{"startMs":4685010,"durationMs":2689,"subtitle":"The positive emotion system is in some degree."},{"startMs":4687699,"durationMs":2851,"subtitle":"But the negative emotion system, that evolved later."},{"startMs":4690550,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"And there's a couple of them."},{"startMs":4691550,"durationMs":2620,"subtitle":"There's one that produces pain, we'll talk about it more."},{"startMs":4694170,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"And there's another one that produces anxiety."},{"startMs":4696570,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"And so, now you kind of understand--roughly--the relationship between motivation, perception,"},{"startMs":4704850,"durationMs":1220,"subtitle":"and emotion."},{"startMs":4706070,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"They all act together."},{"startMs":4709010,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"And they're all dependent in this weird way on what you're after."},{"startMs":4713070,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"So you can think for 50 years and you won't get to the bottom of it."},{"startMs":4716770,"durationMs":2250,"subtitle":"You know the Buddhists say that everything is illusion."},{"startMs":4719020,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"Maya, right, people live in illusion."},{"startMs":4721500,"durationMs":2949,"subtitle":"Because what you're aiming at determines what you
