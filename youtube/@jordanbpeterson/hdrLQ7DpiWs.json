something like that."},{"startMs":495500,"durationMs":2020,"subtitle":"And then there's some kind of interpretive structure"},{"startMs":497520,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"that has to grapple with

that idea more,"},{"startMs":532080,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"it's the notion that there's something in all of us,"},{"startMs":537080,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"that transcends all of us,

speaking."},{"startMs":551400,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"And then there's the final element, and that element seems to be"},{"startMs":553800,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"something like consciousness itself, the consciousness that actually inheres in the individual,"},{"startMs":559300,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"so it's not only that you have a structure, it's that the structure

itself,"},{"startMs":616100,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"and that it's the son - the speaking of the son - that is the active principle that turns chaos into

about it at least phenomenologically accurate,"},{"startMs":631720,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"because you do have an interpretive structure and you couldn't understand anything without
