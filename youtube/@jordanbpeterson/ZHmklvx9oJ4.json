thing is no more night terrors."},{"startMs":5341870,"durationMs":3130,"subtitle":"So you get the picture, it’s very, very cool."},{"startMs":5345000,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"Alright so, back to our discussion."},{"startMs":5349600,"durationMs":14860,"subtitle":"Now, alright so you’ve got the brain here."},{"startMs":5364460,"durationMs":13280,"subtitle":"This is the brain as conceptualized by Alexander Luria, who was Russia’s most famous neuropsychologist."},{"startMs":5377740,"durationMs":4650,"subtitle":"So basically he said that there’s a bunch of different ways you can divide up the brain."},{"startMs":5382390,"durationMs":4270,"subtitle":"It depends on what you want, which is an interesting way of thinking about it."},{"startMs":5386660,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"Because you might say well how should you divide up the world and the answer is it depends"},{"startMs":5390700,"durationMs":1539,"subtitle":"on what you want."},{"startMs":5392239,"durationMs":5521,"subtitle":"It depends on some degree of the world, but it depends even more on what you want."},{"startMs":5397760,"durationMs":5129,"subtitle":"So one of the things Luria said was if you go from the back to the front of the brain"},{"startMs":5402889,"durationMs":4661,"subtitle":"– the front’s the grey part here – what you see is, roughly speaking, the back half"},{"startMs":5407550,"durationMs":5150,"subtitle":"of the brain does sensory processing, especially visual processing, and the front half of the"},{"startMs":5412700,"durationMs":1710,"subtitle":"brain does motor processing."},{"startMs":5414410,"durationMs":4570,"subtitle":"Okay, and so if you look at the back of the brain the sensory unit there, you see there’s"},{"startMs":5418980,"durationMs":2210,"subtitle":"an auditory area and a visual area."},{"startMs":5421190,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"What’s cool is those overlap to some degree."},{"startMs":5424730,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"So there’s some hypothesis that the place where the sensory systems overlap are the"},{"startMs":5429750,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"parts that are responsible for your experience of a unified perceptual field."},{"startMs":5434930,"durationMs":4390,"subtitle":"So here’s an example: imagine the visual cortex and the auditory cortex overlap in"},{"startMs":5439320,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"once place."},{"startMs":5440320,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"Okay, so it would sort of be here, about there on the left side."},{"startMs":5445840,"durationMs":2649,"subtitle":"That’s the part you use for silent reading."},{"startMs":5448489,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"Isn’t that cool?"},{"startMs":5450489,"durationMs":2061,"subtitle":"It means your using your eyes as ears."},{"startMs":5452550,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"The way you do that is you use the overlap between the visual and the auditory cortex."},{"startMs":5456390,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"It’s so cool, you can use your eyes as ears."},{"startMs":5460390,"durationMs":3050,"subtitle":"So the senses aren’t as separate as people think."},{"startMs":5463440,"durationMs":3950,"subtitle":"I used to wear glasses and I couldn’t hear what people were saying when I wasn’t wearing"},{"startMs":5467390,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"them."},{"startMs":5468390,"durationMs":2430,"subtitle":"The reason for that is I wasn’t watching their lips."},{"startMs":5470820,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"So a lot of what I was hearing in language processing was the expression on their face"},{"startMs":5474680,"durationMs":1300,"subtitle":"and the movement of their lips."},{"startMs":5475980,"durationMs":2510,"subtitle":"I take off my glasses, and I’m deaf."},{"startMs":5478490,"durationMs":2950,"subtitle":"So anyways, that’s the sensory unit, half of the brain."},{"startMs":5481440,"durationMs":3250,"subtitle":"Most of it’s the visual cortex because we’re visual creatures."},{"startMs":5484690,"durationMs":2049,"subtitle":"The front half is the motor unit."},{"startMs":5486739,"durationMs":1171,"subtitle":"Okay, why?"},{"startMs":5487910,"durationMs":3309,"subtitle":"Well because we proceed and act."},{"startMs":5491219,"durationMs":3011,"subtitle":"So it’s the part of the brain that’s responsible for zipping you around."},{"startMs":5494230,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"You’ve got voluntary action, right?"},{"startMs":5496650,"durationMs":6530,"subtitle":"You inhabit a nervous system that enables you to

going."},{"startMs":5523260,"durationMs":3810,"subtitle":"Yeah there’s lots of things we don’t understand, I can tell you that."},{"startMs":5527070,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"So anyways, the motor unit."},{"startMs":5528910,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"You’ve got the motor strip."},{"startMs":5531230,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"Now if you touch that with an electrode during brain surgery

necessary"},{"startMs":5555560,"durationMs":2170,"subtitle":"so he was trying to figure out what they were doing."},{"startMs":5557730,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"So that’s the part that enables you

prefrontal cortex."},{"startMs":5567030,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"Now, what’s cool is that the premotor strip and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the"},{"startMs":5573710,"durationMs":2450,"subtitle":"motor strip over the course of evolution."},{"startMs":5576160,"durationMs":3450,"subtitle":"So then you might say, well why do we think?"},{"startMs":5579610,"durationMs":3710,"subtitle":"The answer isn’t so that we can come up with accurate, objective representations of"},{"startMs":5583320,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"the world."},{"startMs":5584320,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"The answer is, so that we can plan what to do."},{"startMs":5587200,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"What you see, fundamentally, is that as you move forward in the brain you go from action"},{"startMs":5594460,"durationMs":1940,"subtitle":"to planning action."},{"startMs":5596400,"durationMs":3830,"subtitle":"So by the time you get to the

you’re"},{"startMs":5604810,"durationMs":8970,"subtitle":"basically doing is conjuring up avatars of yourself in an imaginary world, running them"},{"startMs":5613780,"durationMs":4490,"subtitle":"as
