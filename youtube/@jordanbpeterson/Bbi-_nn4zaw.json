governments"},{"startMs":1374480,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"have changed the methodology for measuring price increases so the CPI that we use

on"},{"startMs":1388940,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"because so the CPI for everyone listing that's the Consumer Price Index and it's in principle please"},{"startMs":1395420,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"correct me if I've got any of this wrong it's the average cost of something like a standard

to"},{"startMs":1408200,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"be there was the basket didn't change they picked a basket and they just measured the same basket"},{"startMs":1416000,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"year after year and so you could see the changes now the basket changes the politicians decide what"},{"startMs":1423740,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"to put in the basket and when to take out and generally they take out stuff that's gone

of other indexes that they use where they have hedonics or it is CPI there's hedonics"},{"startMs":1440180,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"and so what hedonics is is the statisticians who compute the

I"},{"startMs":1527900,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"took like 20 of the most circulated newspapers and magazines in the country and I just looked at

increase"},{"startMs":1548300,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"in price wasn't 30 it was a hundred and thirty percent so the question is where did that extra"},{"startMs":1554720,"durationMs":10020,"subtitle":"100 go because you know that those are the prices so obviously the CPI is rigged in such a way as to"},{"startMs":1564740,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"have a a number it's not that people lie when they calculate like they get a certain number and they"},{"startMs":1570380,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"say oh no that's too high the methodology that is used has been engineered to mask the real degree"},{"startMs":1579980,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"to which prices are rising you also pointed to something else that's a fundamental flaw if your"},{"startMs":1586760,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"reasoning is correct which is that if inflation is best construed as ratio of money to Goods merely"},{"startMs":1593840,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"calculating inflation as a consequence of price increase doesn't capture the essential element"},{"startMs":1598640,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"of the inflation because that's a huge problem too because let's say prices should have gone"},{"startMs":1603560,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"down by three percent and instead they go up by two percent that's five percent inflation in that"},{"startMs":1610160,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"my cost of living is five percent higher than it would have been um had you not had the inflation"},{"startMs":1615920,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"and again if you think about inflation as a tax when the government taxes you legitimately let's"},{"startMs":1621800,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"say through a sales tax or an income tax whatever the government takes your money money that you had"},{"startMs":1626900,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"goes to the government and then the government takes that money and gives it to somebody else"},{"startMs":1630440,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"right you lose your money but when they tax you through inflation they don't take any of your"},{"startMs":1634820,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"money you get to keep your money but they print new money and they give that money to somebody"},{"startMs":1638780,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"else now when that's somebody else spends that money that he didn't earn it drives up your prices"},{"startMs":1644120,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"so now you pay more so the government didn't take your money they took your purchasing power"},{"startMs":1650480,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"so it's the same thing and you know another thing about our CPI that they how they changed"},{"startMs":1656540,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"is Once Upon a Time back in the 70s housing prices were in the CPI and and so were rents"},{"startMs":1664460,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"and and that's about a third of the CPI which is shelter but somewhere along the way they decided"},{"startMs":1670760,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"to use something called owner's equivalent rent instead of actual rent or actual home"},{"startMs":1675500,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"prices now what is owner's equivalent rent well it's a fiction that they made"},{"startMs":1679820,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"up that nobody actually pays apparently uh the government calls people at random"},{"startMs":1687080,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and asks them if they own their home how much do they think they could rent it for if they were to"},{"startMs":1693260,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"rent it and they keep track of those numbers now I don't know like you know who they're asking I"},{"startMs":1699440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"mean I've owned homes for a long time I've never gotten a call from a government guy wanting to"},{"startMs":1703760,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"know what I think I could rent my house for but if you're not a landlord and you're not in the

way"},{"startMs":1712580,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"to try to measure the cost of Shelter by using a number okay so let me okay so let me ask you"},{"startMs":1718940,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"a question about that because I've really been curious about that because it's obvious the K the"},{"startMs":1724400,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"case in Canada in particular like housing and rent prices have skyrocketed in the last eight years"},{"startMs":1729920,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"and that's not reflected in the inflation statistics and that seems to be a major oversight"},{"startMs":1735740,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"at least according to one line of argumentation because that's one-third of what people spend"},{"startMs":1740420,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"their money on now you could argue this is where it gets complicated as far as I can tell that"},{"startMs":1747860,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"if what you've bought is an asset that generates income and its value goes up that's actually not"},{"startMs":1755600,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"a cost to you it's an advantage you already made reference well only if you if you own

right"},{"startMs":1766340,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"because now the assets that you want to buy are more more costly right so does that imply"},{"startMs":1771980,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"that a proper CPI that would include the cost of shelter would be calculated on the basis of those"},{"startMs":1780080,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"who want to buy rather than those who already own yeah because I'm trying to figure out how"},{"startMs":1785060,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"to measure inflation properly here right you're very complicated problem if you already own a home"},{"startMs":1791240,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"then the cost of buying another one is not as important to you of course a lot of people that"},{"startMs":1796940,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"own homes they may want to buy bigger homes as their families grow and and so it would be but"},{"startMs":1801680,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"for those people what's important are uh your maintenance costs your insurance costs your"},{"startMs":1810560,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"property taxes uh there are a lot of other factors that would be significant to you if you don't own"},{"startMs":1817100,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"if you're a renter then obviously rent is of primary importance to you you're you're paying"},{"startMs":1822980,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"rent there's all sorts of valid ways that the government could measure shelter as a component"},{"startMs":1828560,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"of the cost of living but in the United States they don't choose any of those valid ways they"},{"startMs":1833060,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"choose another way and they're doing that because they want the number to be lower they don't want"},{"startMs":1838160,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"to report High inflation and they even do this as part of the GNP because when they deport report"},{"startMs":1844700,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"GDP they don't even do GNP anymore it's GDP now that they report gross domestic product"},{"startMs":1850520,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"in order to get the number they have to deflate it every there's a deflator which adjusts the GDP for"},{"startMs":1856700,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"prices and the government always underestimates that deflator so the GDP looks bigger than it"},{"startMs":1863840,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"really is because in many cases economies are actually Contracting in real terms but because"},{"startMs":1868940,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"the government is dishonest in the way it reports it it reports economic growth even though there"},{"startMs":1875240,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"is no real growth it's inflation which creates the illusion of growth that's another reason"},{"startMs":1879560,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"that politicians like inflation and of course when inflation drives up the stock market and the real"},{"startMs":1884540,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"estate market people think they're richer right because oh my house has gone way up my stock but"},{"startMs":1889700,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"it hasn't gone up your money has gone down right but people don't necessarily connect those dots"},{"startMs":1895700,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"uh you know they they think they're they think they're wealthier but also if you think about"},{"startMs":1900680,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"as I said earlier inflation benefits debtors it's a transfer of wealth from creditors to"},{"startMs":1906860,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"debtors who are the biggest debtors in the world governments and the biggest most highly indebted"},{"startMs":1914840,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"government is the United States government we have 32 trillion dollars of funded debt almost"},{"startMs":1919640,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and our unfunded liabilities commitments that have been made where they didn't borrow the money

Medicare"},{"startMs":1930440,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"all that stuff that's like a hundred trillion so when the government creates inflation they"},{"startMs":1936020,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"repudiate enormous amounts of their debt and so the governments have massive incentives to create"},{"startMs":1942920,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"inflation but then they have massive incentives to lie about it and pretend it's not as bad as it is"},{"startMs":1948680,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"and blame other people which is the main reason that they redefine inflation from the expansion"},{"startMs":1955040,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"of the money supply to Rising prices because when you know inflation is an expansion of the"},{"startMs":1960140,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"money supply then you know who causes it it's the government you can't blame greedy corporations for"},{"startMs":1966560,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"it you can't blame Putin for it Putin doesn't print our money we do the Federal Reserve does"},{"startMs":1972260,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"and so when politicians can redefine inflation they can they can blame everybody but themselves"},{"startMs":1979100,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"okay so so let me ask you a kind of a modified Ponzi scheme question because this is something"},{"startMs":1984680,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"that's bedeviled me so I understand that so I have two questions I understand that getting"},{"startMs":1990140,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"the measurements of something as fundamental as inflation correct is absolutely necessary"},{"startMs":1995960,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"so one of the things I've wondered is like why aren't there independent teams of economists who"},{"startMs":2002020,"durationMs":8820,"subtitle":"generate various true estimates of inflation make them public so that the public itself could gather"},{"startMs":2010840,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"a basket of independent estimates and know for themselves what the inflation rate is very curious"},{"startMs":2016660,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"about that well they have one other well I mean there's a website who's reliable who's reliable"},{"startMs":2023620,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"yeah you know well I think the least reliable would be the government"},{"startMs":2027700,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"right yeah yeah you don't want their statistics because they're completely biased right you know"},{"startMs":2032740,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"it's like you know the mafia is not going to give you accurate statistics on crime right so um you"},{"startMs":2039220,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"got to look to Independent sources but um I think it's kind of obvious though if you understand what"},{"startMs":2046720,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"inflation is and you see the enormity I mean the United States is running two trillion dollar a"},{"startMs":2051160,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"year plus deficits now uh and technically we're not even in a recession the deficits are going to"},{"startMs":2056020,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"get even bigger uh when this next recession starts but how are we financing those deficits it's it's"},{"startMs":2063040,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"inflation there's just no other way they'll look at the the Federal Reserves balance sheet so we"},{"startMs":2067900,"durationMs":9060,"subtitle":"know that inflation is going to be a significant threat it's going to reduce the value of money and"},{"startMs":2076960,"durationMs":11100,"subtitle":"so that has to be the single most important factor in driving your decisions on savings on investing"},{"startMs":2089320,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"um you know and and even for in this day and age if you don't have a lot of money to invest"},{"startMs":2094660,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"you know I I've been saying this for years to people I started talking about it several years"},{"startMs":2099220,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"ago people have to stock up on things you know you know buy things that you're going to use in"},{"startMs":2105100,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"a year or two buy it now because it's going to be a lot more expensive if you wait why hold on to"},{"startMs":2110740,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"the cash if the cash is going to lose value uh just buy the things that you're actually"},{"startMs":2116020,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"going to need because those things will retain their value if you're planning on using them"},{"startMs":2121480,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"so here's the Ponzi scheme question so because of the efficiencies of the capitalist system"},{"startMs":2130720,"durationMs":8340,"subtitle":"free market system let's say we are generally able to produce more for less and in some instances we"},{"startMs":2139060,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"seem to be doing that faster and faster so consumer electronics are a good example and"},{"startMs":2143980,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"price of computation and so forth and so what that means is that independent of inflation"},{"startMs":2149860,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"because of technological progress things will get cheaper in the future the future will be richer"},{"startMs":2156460,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"than the present so then you might say if you're a politician you say well if that's the case and"},{"startMs":2161380,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"if that's invariably the the case then why not defer our debt to the Future like essentially"},{"startMs":2167800,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"why not borrow from the future because the future is going to be wealthier than the"},{"startMs":2171400,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"present and then I wonder like if we had a three percent increment in actual productivity per year"},{"startMs":2179800,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"then maybe we could tolerate a two percent inflation rate because fundamentally"},{"startMs":2185380,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"the tendency for things to get cheaper because of enhanced productivity would be balanced by that"},{"startMs":2190480,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"inflationary proclivity so are the politicians could you make a case that the politicians are"},{"startMs":2195340,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"making a good bet because they're throwing the debt into the future when we're going to be"},{"startMs":2200380,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"richer no well they they are making a politically opportunistic decision yeah fair enough because"},{"startMs":2207640,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"they're they're telling the voters hey don't worry about it your grandkids will pay for it right or"},{"startMs":2212320,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"whatever uh and and right of course not all voters have kids right some voters you know don't have"},{"startMs":2217360,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"kids and so what do they care if somebody else's grandchildren uh pay for their for their program"},{"startMs":2222640,"durationMs":10920,"subtitle":"but the only time you could justify borrowing from the future is if you are creating something that"},{"startMs":2234100,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"future uh people will benefit from let's say a capital investment let's say the government"},{"startMs":2238660,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"is going to build a bridge and that bridge is going to be there for 100 years right uh and"},{"startMs":2244180,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"and people who aren't even born yet are going to benefit from that bridge okay maybe they can"},{"startMs":2249040,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"sell bonds to finance the construction of that bridge that future people will end up paying"},{"startMs":2254920,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"because they're going to have the benefit of that bridge so you can make an argument"},{"startMs":2259060,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"for

and grandchildren with nothing but a bill"},{"startMs":2269980,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"right they don't have a bridge or a capital asset uh the money's been spent I see so your
