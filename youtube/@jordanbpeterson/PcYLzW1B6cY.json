say it’s something like the interview."},{"startMs":3544200,"durationMs":3510,"subtitle":"So I would say that’s sort of a mid-level anomaly,

that’s because there are other places that you can go where there are potential"},{"startMs":3556050,"durationMs":4010,"subtitle":"futures lying, so it’s not like you’re out of potential futures just because you"},{"startMs":3560060,"durationMs":1960,"subtitle":"walk through that."},{"startMs":3562020,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"So you say, well, what’s in that room is anomalous, you don’t

matter to you?"},{"startMs":3574280,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"You think, that’s a pretty weird question, because things are made out of matter."},{"startMs":3580020,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"So what do you mean when you say does this matter to you?"},{"startMs":3582740,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"Well, partly what it means is that before matter was our matter, it was a matter that"},{"startMs":3587220,"durationMs":3390,"subtitle":"was more complicated, linguistically speaking."},{"startMs":3590610,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"So if you go back far enough, what people meant by matter wasn’t this [raps on desk]."},{"startMs":3597690,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"It was more like, I would say, it’s more like potential."},{"startMs":3600990,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"Or it’s more like information."},{"startMs":3602830,"durationMs":1720,"subtitle":"That’s another way of thinking about it."},{"startMs":3604550,"durationMs":3470,"subtitle":"So you could certainly say that room is chock-full of information."},{"startMs":3608020,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"So let’s go with the information idea, just for the sake of argument."},{"startMs":3611700,"durationMs":4270,"subtitle":"We already

that, right?"},{"startMs":3633150,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"Well so I would say you went into that room and you extracted some spirit out of the potential."},{"startMs":3639090,"durationMs":4290,"subtitle":"Now that’s exactly how Piaget looked at it by the way."},{"startMs":3643380,"durationMs":4270,"subtitle":"Well, I shouldn’t say ‘exactly’ because it’s probably not exactly the way he looked"},{"startMs":3647650,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"at it."},{"startMs":3648650,"durationMs":4110,"subtitle":"But basically what Piaget proclaimed with children was that children will try out a"},{"startMs":3652760,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"little routine, and then something will happen that doesn’t fit in their little

past."},{"startMs":3669480,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"So for example, the first thing a nine-month old will do crawling around on the floor if"},{"startMs":3675920,"durationMs":4530,"subtitle":"it encounters something that’s roughly mouth-sized is put it in their mouth."},{"startMs":3680450,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"Why?"},{"startMs":3681450,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"Well they don’t know what it is, but they kind of know how to use their mouth."},{"startMs":3684370,"durationMs":3470,"subtitle":"So they throw it into their mouth, and then they tongue it, and they get some sense of"},{"startMs":3687840,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"sort of how it tastes, which is very important, and what its shape is and all that, because"},{"startMs":3691320,"durationMs":3970,"subtitle":"they’re very wired up in their mouth, and so they can investigate like mad."},{"startMs":3695290,"durationMs":6510,"subtitle":"And so what they encounter is a thing and then when they throw it in their mouth they"},{"startMs":3701800,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"practice doing something with it, you know, getting its shape, so now they know something"},{"startMs":3706180,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"about it."},{"startMs":3707180,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"So that changes them from a spiritual perspective, a psychological

information,"},{"startMs":3715190,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and they’ve also transformed the thing into a specific thing with specific features."},{"startMs":3720550,"durationMs":4250,"subtitle":"And so what you might say is that out of potential spirit and matter arise."},{"startMs":3724800,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"And that’s a very interesting way of looking at it."},{"startMs":3728360,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"Also it fits well with the phenomenological philosophers."},{"startMs":3731900,"durationMs":10450,"subtitle":"Because they believe that we encountered phenomena and phenomena were those things that shone"},{"startMs":3742350,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"forth."},{"startMs":3743350,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"And so that’s like a reversion to the idea of meaning."},{"startMs":3745910,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"Because you’ve got to think about it this way too…"},{"startMs":3748570,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"it’s like when you walk into a library, God, what’s in there?"},{"startMs":3754690,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"Well, it’s inexhaustible, a library."},{"startMs":3758070,"durationMs":1970,"subtitle":"Well, how come you just don’t
