way."},{"startMs":171320,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"And that's actually a mistake, because we know that these traits are normally distributed, roughly speaking,

distribution."},{"startMs":184160,"durationMs":20000,"subtitle":"And so to make the pre-supposition, for example, that being extroverted is better than being introverted, or that being emotionally

agreeableness or disagreeableness."},{"startMs":290600,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"So let's think about this for a minute."},{"startMs":292660,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"So I'm going to tell you how I conceptualize agreeableness."},{"startMs":296100,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"The first thing you want to know is that women are more agreeable than men."},{"startMs":298980,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"About half a standard deviation."},{"startMs":301120,"durationMs":10320,"subtitle":"And that's approximately enough so that if you took a random male and a random female out of the population, and you tried to guess who was more agreeable, and you guessed the female, you'd be right about 60% of the time."},{"startMs":312100,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"But what's interesting about that, and this is something also to keep in mind, about normal distributions, you know."},{"startMs":319320,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"Imagine you have normal distribution, so that most people are in the middle."},{"startMs":322820,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"And then you have another normal distribution, male and female, and mostly they overlap."},{"startMs":327580,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"But, you see, out here, and out here, they don't overlap at all."},{"startMs":332420,"durationMs":8360,"subtitle":"And so, even though on average, men and women aren't that much different in terms of their levels of agreeableness by the group,"},{"startMs":340780,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"if you go out and you look at the extremes, they're very different."},{"startMs":343040,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"So all of the most agreeable people are women, and all of the most disagreeable people are men."},{"startMs":348600,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"And the thing is, the extremes are often what matter, rather than what's in the middle."},{"startMs":352440,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"And so one of the ways that's reflected in society, by the way, is there's way more men in prison."},{"startMs":358080,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"And the best personality predictor of being in prison is to be low in agreeableness."},{"startMs":362860,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"It makes you callous."},{"startMs":364780,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"Now, you might think, \"What's the opposite of compassion and politeness?\""},{"startMs":367600,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"And the answer to that is, I think it's best conceptualized as a trading game."},{"startMs":374880,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"So let's say that we're going to play repeated trading games."},{"startMs":378700,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"And if you're very agreeable, then you're going to bargain harder on my behalf than you're going to bargain on your own behalf."},{"startMs":385240,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"Whereas if you're very disagreeable, you're going to do the reverse."},{"startMs":387780,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"You're going to think, \"I'm in this trading game for me, and you're going to take care of your own interests.\""},{"startMs":392740,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"Where an agreeable person is going to say, \"No, no, at worst this has to be 50-50, but I'd like to help you every way I can.\""},{"startMs":401040,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"Okay, so you kind of understand that."},{"startMs":403880,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"Now the advantage to being agreeable, then, is that you're good in teams and you're very much likely to give other people credit."},{"startMs":409380,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"The down side of being agreeable is that you're not good at putting forward your own interests."},{"startMs":414280,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"And so one of the things that predicts salary across time, for example, is agreeableness, and it predicts it negatively."},{"startMs":420740,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"And so it's part of the reason why women get paid less than men, and this is something for the women in the class to really listen to."},{"startMs":427500,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"Because how you get paid across time depends on a very large number of things, right?"},{"startMs":432340,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"It depends on your skills and your abilities and your position and your social network and all of that."},{"startMs":437080,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"But the other thing it depends on is whether or not you actually go ask for money."},{"startMs":440720,"durationMs":1720,"subtitle":"Or maybe that you don't even ask."},{"startMs":442440,"durationMs":1800,"subtitle":"Because actually, you don't ask for money."},{"startMs":444240,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"You tell people that you need to be paid more or something they don't like will happen."},{"startMs":448140,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"And I don't mean as a threat."},{"startMs":449860,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"I mean that you have to be willing, when you're negotiating, to have an alternative."},{"startMs":454820,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"You go talk to your boss, who isn't going to give you money, because everyone wants money, right?"},{"startMs":458440,"durationMs":1380,"subtitle":"It's a competitive game."},{"startMs":460020,"durationMs":10360,"subtitle":"You're going to have to go there and say, \"Look, here's what I do. Here's why it's useful. Here's why you have to give me more money. And this is my opportunities if you don't.\""},{"startMs":470940,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"And then, you're not taking your boss's money anyway, because it's very frequently the case that he's working for a whopping big company."},{"startMs":477860,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"But he needs an excuse to give you money because everyone's asking for money all the time."},{"startMs":483600,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"And so you have to put your case forward powerfully and disagreeably."},{"startMs":488660,"durationMs":8180,"subtitle":"Now, you don't want to do it too disagreeably because then he's gonna think that you're a son of a bitch and maybe he's not gonna give you anything and maybe you'll get fired for being mouthy, and all of that."},{"startMs":496840,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"And that certainly happens to people who are too disagreeable."},{"startMs":499540,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"You gotta get the balance right."},{"startMs":501400,"durationMs":1120,"subtitle":"But it's definitely the case."},{"startMs":502520,"durationMs":9240,"subtitle":"And the other thing that happens to women that's also worth noting, and this is probably because they're higher in negative emotion, is they tend to underestimate their own utility in business settings."},{"startMs":511940,"durationMs":11560,"subtitle":"Right, because if you're trying to evaluate what you're like, and you're more tilted toward negative emotion, then the things that you do that are wrong are gonna stand out more on the foreground than the things that you do that are right."},{"startMs":523640,"durationMs":11080,"subtitle":"So if you go into a negotiation, and you're uncertain already, because you have self doubts, and then you're agreeable in the negotiation, what's going to happen is that you're not going to win as often."},{"startMs":535000,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"And winning, in a business setting, or in a career development setting, means more opportunity for promotion and more revenue generated."},{"startMs":542560,"durationMs":11240,"subtitle":"Now, the downside of that, of course, is as you climb the business hierarchy, you also have to take on more responsibility, and that responsibility is sometimes unpleasant as well, especially to people who are agreeable."},{"startMs":553800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"Because you're not necessarily liked if you're in a position of authority."},{"startMs":557640,"durationMs":2140,"subtitle":"And agreeable people really like to be liked."},{"startMs":559780,"durationMs":8120,"subtitle":"It's their primary motivator because they're concerned about the maintenance of intimate, positive relationships."},{"startMs":567900,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"That also makes them conflict avoidant."},{"startMs":570700,"durationMs":8480,"subtitle":"Okay so now, you guys can think about this, but I'll tell you why I think the personality differences between men and women exist."},{"startMs":579500,"durationMs":6700,"subtitle":"Now, these are speculative hypotheses, but they're reasonably well documented by the relevant literature."},{"startMs":586200,"durationMs":1260,"subtitle":"So let's think about it."},{"startMs":587460,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"The first thing we might think about is: what's the difference between men and women?"},{"startMs":591080,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"How do they differ?"},{"startMs":593000,"durationMs":8320,"subtitle":"Well the first thing we might observe is that if you look at personality differences between pre-pubescent boys and girls, they're not very large."},{"startMs":601560,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"Boys and girls don't differ in terms of their trait neuroticism, for example."},{"startMs":606460,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"What happens is that, when puberty kicks in, women's trait neuroticism rises and it stays higher than men for the rest of their life."},{"startMs":613920,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"And this is why you see this reflected in the different kinds of psychopathology that beset the two sexes."},{"startMs":619140,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"So men are over-represented in alcoholism, drug abuse, anti-social personality, and a host of learning disorders as well as attention deficit disorder."},{"startMs":627720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"And women are over-represented in depression and anxiety, primarily."},{"startMs":631400,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"That seems to be tightly associated with higher levels of trait neuroticism."},{"startMs":634720,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"Because if you're at the 95th percentile or higher, let's say, in trait neuroticism,"},{"startMs":640740,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"there isn't much difference between that and being somewhat prone to depression and anxiety."},{"startMs":645820,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"And because the curves overlap, the curves aren't identical,"},{"startMs":651220,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"the normal distributions aren't identical for men and women, you tilt the women's curve to the right towards higher levels of neuroticism."},{"startMs":659400,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"You go out and you look for the person in twenty who has the highest levels of negative emotion."},{"startMs":664120,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"It's much more likely to be female than male."},{"startMs":666700,"durationMs":2060,"subtitle":"Okay, so let's see if we can figure out why."},{"startMs":668920,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"So, we're gonna tell you some basic differences between men and women and you can tell me what you think about it, if you agree or disagree."},{"startMs":675560,"durationMs":1300,"subtitle":"Okay, first."},{"startMs":677600,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"Size differential emerges between men and women at puberty, right?"},{"startMs":681100,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"Because boys and girls are roughly the same size and roughly the same strength."},{"startMs":684480,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"But men get bigger at puberty, when testosterone kicks in."},{"startMs":687920,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"And more importantly, not only do they get taller and heavier, but their upper body strength is much higher."},{"startMs":693920,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"And that's a real issue for combat, because human beings punch, and there's other animals that do that."},{"startMs":699920,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"Kangaroos do that too, so we're not the only people that punch."},{"startMs":703340,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"But we have clubs on the ends of our arms, and so that's how we defend ourselves."},{"startMs":707660,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"And so if you have a lot of upper body strength, especially across the shoulders, and you're heavier, then you can step into the punch and it's a lot more devastating."},{"startMs":715480,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"Now it is the case that, if you look at the statistics for physical altercations in marriage, women attack their husbands more often than husbands attack their wives."},{"startMs":724740,"durationMs":1800,"subtitle":"Well, you think, \"Why is that?\""},{"startMs":726800,"durationMs":9500,"subtitle":"Well, let's assume that there isn't any reason, other than both people in a relationship can get upset, and the women know that if they hit their husbands, nothing's really going to happen."},{"startMs":736640,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"Right, because if you're a woman about that high, and your husband is, say, my height,"},{"startMs":742380,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"unless you hit me with an object or something that's sharp, the probability that you're going to do me any serious damage is pretty low."},{"startMs":748280,"durationMs":1060,"subtitle":"You might hurt me."},{"startMs":749540,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"But if I do the reverse, and hit you, and I really hit you then I might kill you."},{"startMs":753800,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"And so, at least one of the reasons why women can be more physically aggressive in minor ways in a relationship"},{"startMs":760620,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"is because everyone knows, the wife and the husband equally, that the consequence of the physical aggression is much more limited."},{"startMs":767740,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"So, men do more serious damage to women."},{"startMs":770780,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"But women are more aggressive in relationships."},{"startMs":773280,"durationMs":960,"subtitle":"So that's interesting."},{"startMs":774240,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"So ok, so there's a body size difference that's important,"},{"startMs":777660,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"a strength differential that's important."},{"startMs":779720,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"Next thing, I think..."},{"startMs":782220,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"So let's assume that the reason that women are higher in sensitivity to negative emotion"},{"startMs":785900,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"is because the world is actually more dangerous to women, right?"},{"startMs":789580,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"Because that would be the most logical reason why there would be a"},{"startMs":792080,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"sex difference in something like fear sensitivity and punishment."},{"startMs":797700,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"Well first there's the danger of physical altercation."},{"startMs":800880,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"Second, there's the sexual danger."},{"startMs":803580,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"So women become sexually vulnerable at puberty."},{"startMs":806280,"durationMs":1580,"subtitle":"And why do I say vulnerable?"},{"startMs":807860,"durationMs":1240,"subtitle":"Well it's straightforward."},{"startMs":809100,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"It's because the cost of sex for women is way higher than it is for men."},{"startMs":812780,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"Or it certainly has been throughout our evolutionary history."},{"startMs":815680,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"Because if a man has an unwanted sexual encounter,"},{"startMs":819040,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"well then he walks away and maybe he is persecuted by the the state or prosecuted by the state for it."},{"startMs":823980,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"But if a woman has an unwanted, unwarranted, or incautious sexual encounter,"},{"startMs":828580,"durationMs":1500,"subtitle":"and she ends up pregnant,"},{"startMs":830200,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"then, well, in traditional societies, you're just done."},{"startMs":834060,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"And even in modern societies that are rich like ours,"},{"startMs":836660,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"you're... it's a... I don't have to go into that."},{"startMs":841360,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"It's big trouble."},{"startMs":842560,"durationMs":2020,"subtitle":"No matter what you do about it, it's big trouble."},{"startMs":844840,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"So being more nervous about that makes perfect sense."},{"startMs":848280,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"But then, here's the last thing."},{"startMs":851000,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"I think that women's nervous systems are not adapted to women."},{"startMs":856220,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"I think women's nervous systems are adapted to the mother-infant dyad."},{"startMs":861040,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"Because you are not the same creature when you have an infant."},{"startMs":864060,"durationMs":620,"subtitle":"Not at all."},{"startMs":864680,"durationMs":1420,"subtitle":"You're way more vulnerable."},{"startMs":866280,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"And it's partly because you have to express the vulnerability of the infant."},{"startMs":870060,"durationMs":1720,"subtitle":"And you also have to care for it."},{"startMs":872040,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"Right, so, you think about an infant, especially under nine months."},{"startMs":875680,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"So let's say, how are you going to be wired up if you're going to optimally care for an infant under nine months?"},{"startMs":881340,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"And I'm saying under nine months because women generally do the bulk of child care for infants who are under nine months old."},{"startMs":887200,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"And part of the reason for that, there's a whole host of reasons, but part of the reasons for that, obviously,"},{"startMs":891520,"durationMs":1220,"subtitle":"is that they breast-feed."},{"startMs":893280,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"But imagine what you need to be wired up biologically in order to care for an infant."},{"startMs":897100,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"First of all, they're very demanding."},{"startMs":900400,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"Right?"},{"startMs":900960,"durationMs":1680,"subtitle":"Because they're completely helpless."},{"startMs":902640,"durationMs":2140,"subtitle":"And they're demanding twenty-four hours a day."},{"startMs":905200,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"And it's quite an emotional load."},{"startMs":910220,"durationMs":2300,"subtitle":"And an infant under nine months is never
