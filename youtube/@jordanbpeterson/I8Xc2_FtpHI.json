something"},{"startMs":2523000,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"and then what it meant to believe something"},{"startMs":2527220,"durationMs":560,"subtitle":"and then"},{"startMs":2528600,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"how it could be that someone could believe something, so deeply"},{"startMs":2532980,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"that they would risk their own death, to"},{"startMs":2535400,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"protect it, or at least risk the death of other people"},{"startMs":2539380,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and maybe on a massive scale, like, man, people are committeda to their system"},{"startMs":2545820,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"now, you know, a system of belief is not just a system of belief, that's one of the things I came to

belief system, or the integrity of the belief system even"},{"startMs":2593960,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"it's the match between the belief system and the actions of the other people within the belief system"},{"startMs":2599760,"durationMs":2040,"subtitle":"what you want to maintain is that match"},{"startMs":2601960,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"you want to act out your

distinction between home and the strange land"},{"startMs":2744980,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"and the thing about familiar territory for people, is that most of the familiar territory that we

structure"},{"startMs":2767840,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"and you know where you fit in it most of the time"},{"startMs":2770120,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and so when you act out in that

do"},{"startMs":2834540,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"and that's unexplored territory too"},{"startMs":2837100,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"and that's another way of thinking about

because of the physical structure and it's working"},{"startMs":2857380,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"but it's also because none of you are manifesting peculiar

first"},{"startMs":2874960,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"because all of a sudden this would be unexplored territory"},{"startMs":2878900,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"the match between what you want,

don't know where you are"},{"startMs":2898080,"durationMs":1980,"subtitle":"what do you do when you don't know what to do"},{"startMs":2900420,"durationMs":2220,"subtitle":"well, if you are a computer

helpful"},{"startMs":2910900,"durationMs":1960,"subtitle":"you freeze, first"},{"startMs":2913940,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"and then you maybe cautiously attend, or maybe you don't, maybe you just keep you're damn eyes averted"},{"startMs":2918860,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"and you sit there and you hope that no one notices you"},{"startMs":2921200,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"that's a prey response, right that's like a rabbit frozen when it thinks a fox is looking at it"},{"startMs":2927200,"durationMs":2180,"subtitle":"and we were prey animals for a long time"},{"startMs":2929760,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"there was a cat"},{"startMs":2931280,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"that they recently discovered, a prehistoric cat that had this bottom single

you here and pierce the back of your skull with it's"},{"startMs":2945960,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"single tooth, and that is what it was evolved for, so, you know"},{"startMs":2952040,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"It's under such conditions we evolved and we are predators obviously"},{"startMs":2956660,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"but we are tasty predators, and so other things were perfectly happy to eat us"},{"startMs":2964060,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and so where you are don't know what to do you act like a prey animal"},{"startMs":2968300,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and that is probably what you should do because maybe if you keep your head down"},{"startMs":2972640,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"and shut the hell up"},{"startMs":2973920,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"there won't be any attention attracted to you"},{"startMs":2976680,"durationMs":1960,"subtitle":"and maybe you will get through it"},{"startMs":2979880,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you might decide, unlikely, to intervene"},{"startMs":2984960,"durationMs":1480,"subtitle":"and take the guy down"},{"startMs":2986840,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"but"},{"startMs":2989040,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"but you would be the exception rather than the norm, and it's unsurprising"},{"startMs":2999020,"durationMs":680,"subtitle":"OK, so"},{"startMs":3001680,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"What is came to understand is that belief systems regulated emotions"},{"startMs":3006420,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"but not exactly psychologically, like, it isn't exactly"},{"startMs":3010260,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"it isn't exactly, and this is sort of like the terror management theories, it's not exactly like you have a theory"},{"startMs":3016400,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"in your head, and because the theory explains the world, and because the theory explains the world"},{"startMs":3020300,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"the theory is what is making you secure"},{"startMs":3022500,"durationMs":1420,"subtitle":"it's kind of like that"},{"startMs":3023960,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"it's like you have a theory in you head"},{"startMs":3026440,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"and the theory makes you feel secure because it explains the world"},{"startMs":3029580,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"but the reason it explains the world is because other people have the theory in their head"},{"startMs":3033800,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"and when you both act out the theory"},{"startMs":3036300,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"you both get what you want, and it's the coming together of the theory"},{"startMs":3041540,"durationMs":2500,"subtitle":"and the outcome that makes you"},{"startMs":3045780,"durationMs":640,"subtitle":"it's life"},{"startMs":3047360,"durationMs":1220,"subtitle":"not only does it"},{"startMs":3049060,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"stop you from being anxious and often make you happy because you get what you want, but"},{"startMs":3053840,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"it's not just psychological you know the fact that we do this, that we cooperate"},{"startMs":3058680,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"within our societies, we match our belief systems and then act them out"},{"startMs":3062600,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"that's the predicate a productive society"},{"startMs":3065980,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"so, it's actually, it isn't that just that it saves you from death anxiety like the terror management"},{"startMs":3073100,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"theorists have it, it saves you from death"},{"startMs":3075920,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"and, that's good, I mean, being protected from death anxiety, yay, well, good"},{"startMs":3081120,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"that's great too man, but actually not dying, that sort of the fundamental thing that you are after"},{"startMs":3087140,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and so, people have reason to defend their territory"},{"startMs":3090660,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"if you think of territory that way, if you think about it as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions"},{"startMs":3096940,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens"},{"startMs":3102020,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"They have every reason to defend that"},{"startMs":3104600,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and if it falls apart, it can have mortally"},{"startMs":3108680,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"serious consequences, it's chaos, you know that chaos just doesn't destabilize everybody psychologically"},{"startMs":3115680,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"it destabilizes everything, it can destabilize the currency"},{"startMs":3119120,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"it can destabilize the

good,"},{"startMs":3126080,"durationMs":640,"subtitle":"so"},{"startMs":3127720,"durationMs":2300,"subtitle":"hey, no wonder people protect it"},{"startMs":3134420,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"so then I started thinking about what a belief system was"},{"startMs":3139880,"durationMs":720,"subtitle":"and"},{"startMs":3143480,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"I realized that a belief system was actually a set of moral guidelines"},{"startMs":3148480,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"and moral guidelines are guidelines about how you should, behave"},{"startMs":3153160,"durationMs":1980,"subtitle":"also how you should perceive"},{"startMs":3155440,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"and the reason that a moral guideline"},{"startMs":3158280,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"is necessary for you to perceive is that"},{"startMs":3162180,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"you can't look at anything without a hierarchy of value"},{"startMs":3165400,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"right, think about it, how may things in this room could you look at"},{"startMs":3169580,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"there is an innumerable in this room to look at"},{"startMs":3173320,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"there are just all the squares, the little tiny squares in this fabric"},{"startMs":3177020,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"you could look at those things, for, until the end of time, one at a time, but you don't do that"},{"startMs":3182400,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"in fact, if I took most of you out of this room"},{"startMs":3185200,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"there is a very low probability that you would be able to tell me what color the walls were, or"},{"startMs":3190700,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"even if those things were on the walls"},{"startMs":3193420,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"and the reason for that, is that, who cares"},{"startMs":3197880,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"as long as the walls don't move"},{"startMs":3200240,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"color is irrelavant, and there is no reason for you to remember it"},{"startMs":3203640,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"it has no emotional significance"},{"startMs":3206060,"durationMs":1460,"subtitle":"it has no value"},{"startMs":3207900,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"and so what you do instead is"},{"startMs":3210220,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"well, this is what you're doing, so, why are you here"},{"startMs":3214080,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"I don't mean in, the broad metaphysical sense, I mean specifically why are you here right now"},{"startMs":3220700,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"and I would say that you are students, obviously"},{"startMs":3223380,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"and you are trying to get a degree, and"},{"startMs":3225760,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"you know you believe that will have some functional utility"},{"startMs":3228940,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"maybe you will be a little wiser, and a little more literate"},{"startMs":3231960,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"and be able to think a little better, and be able to write a little better and so you will actually be more functional in the world"},{"startMs":3238000,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"that would be good"},{"startMs":3239200,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"you know, and, maybe you are interested, but anyways it's"},{"startMs":3243680,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"You're in this particular lecture, so that you can take this particular class"},{"startMs":3249000,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"so that you can get a particular kind of degree"},{"startMs":3251740,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"so that you can launch your life, and then in your life you are probably going to meet someone that you"},{"startMs":3256500,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"have a long term relationship with, and you are going to have children, and you are going to partake in the society, and"},{"startMs":3262120,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"that's why you are here, all of those reasons, simultaneously is why you are here"},{"startMs":3267840,"durationMs":800,"subtitle":"and so then"},{"startMs":3268640,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"that helps you decide what to look at"},{"startMs":3271320,"durationMs":1820,"subtitle":"and so what you look at is"},{"startMs":3273900,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"at the moment or listen to is me because, in principle"},{"startMs":3279400,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"I am the gateway to that set of accomplishments, at this moment"},{"startMs":3285080,"durationMs":940,"subtitle":"and so"},{"startMs":3286920,"durationMs":1220,"subtitle":"you focus on me"},{"startMs":3288480,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"and that's because you value that"},{"startMs":3291580,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and so what that means is that you can't even look at the world without a value structure"},{"startMs":3296360,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"you know it's chaos, if everything is equally unimportant or if everything is equally important"},{"startMs":3301940,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"it's chaos, so a value system, structures"},{"startMs":3305960,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"the very way that you perceive the world, and

is"},{"startMs":6050940,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and you know, people need meaning in their lives because their lives are difficult"},{"startMs":6055100,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"and so , the question is"},{"startMs":6057560,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"to what end should you devote your life"},{"startMs":6060700,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"and another question might be does it matter"},{"startMs":6064060,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"matter is an interesting word, because matter is matter, but matter is also what matters"},{"startMs":6071680,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and I would say that what matters is more than real than matter"},{"startMs":6075760,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"at least that's how you act, and then the question is, well, is there something that you should be aiming at"},{"startMs":6082380,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"It's a good question, that's the question of the meaning of life"},{"startMs":6086620,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and when one of the things that is supposed to happen when you come to university"},{"startMs":6091580,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"is that the sort of question that should be addressed"},{"startMs":6094440,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"and as far as I can tell"},{"startMs":6096520,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and this just might be my more cynical side, what I see happening to university students, generally speaking is that they come in"},{"startMs":6104040,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"clinging to the wreckage of their

like"},{"startMs":6137540,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"I don't see that as useful"},{"startMs":6141100,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"quite the contrary"},{"startMs":6151020,"durationMs":1680,"subtitle":"So let me tell you a story"},{"startMs":6158380,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"The first thing I am going to propose to you, and we are going to talk a lot, is that,"},{"startMs":6163800,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"you inhabit a story, that the framework"},{"startMs":6166440,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"through which you look at the world is actually a story, and here is the story"},{"startMs":6171400,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"The story is you are somewhere"},{"startMs":6173400,"durationMs":1700,"subtitle":"and you are going somewhere"},{"startMs":6175100,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"and that can be conceptual or whatever, it's that"},{"startMs":6177640,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"there is a gradient between where you are and where you are aiming at, which means"},{"startMs":6181300,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"no more really than you are doing something while you are sitting there"},{"startMs":6184720,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and hypothetically you are aiming for something better"},{"startMs":6188480,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"and so, you are in a state of

change"},{"startMs":6195100,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"and then you are trying to rectify the insufficiency and"},{"startMs":6198520,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and you presume that your current state is less preferable to the state that you are aiming at"},{"startMs":6203180,"durationMs":2500,"subtitle":"and then, the way that you"},{"startMs":6206200,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"bring those two together is, sometimes you can do that through thinking"},{"startMs":6210080,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"but fundamentally you do it through action"},{"startMs":6212600,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"you do it through acting in the world and so that's sort of"},{"startMs":6215160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"that's sort of the answer in some sense to the mind body problem"},{"startMs":6219000,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"you have a conceptual structure, but when you implement it, you're implementing,"},{"startMs":6223600,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"it not abstractly, you are implementing through action, so"},{"startMs":6227520,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"that's the basic story, it's not a very interesting story"},{"startMs":6231360,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"but it's the framework through which you view the world, so it's a value laden

value laden framework"},{"startMs":6241820,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"you look at the world through a value laden framework so then we might say so what if the optimal value laden framework"},{"startMs":6247340,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"That's what we are going to try and figure out."},{"startMs":6251200,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"now, I told you about the war that went on between"},{"startMs":6255800,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"the Communists and the West and how that obsessed me and"},{"startMs":6260200,"durationMs":1880,"subtitle":"so one of the things that"},{"startMs":6262080,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"I really wondered about was, well was this just an arbitrary thing"},{"startMs":6265860,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"You know, like, did the Communists, they had some axioms, and we had some axioms"},{"startMs":6269140,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"so if you are a moral relativist you might say, well"},{"startMs":6271880,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"whose to say which set of axioms are better,"},{"startMs":6274600,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"or even, whose to claim that you could say that a set of axioms, one set is better than another"},{"startMs":6281320,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"That's a moral relativist claim and you know fair enough!"},{"startMs":6289500,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"So I thought that maybe this is just an arbitrary thing and it is going to be settled by force"},{"startMs":6295500,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"Because that is how you settle an arbitrary claim between two competing systems"},{"startMs":6299520,"durationMs":2100,"subtitle":"where there is no room for negotiation"},{"startMs":6301620,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"So I thought about that for a long time, I wanted to know"},{"startMs":6304740,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"what the roots were of the Marxist system and what the roots were of the Western system, and"},{"startMs":6310680,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"what I surmised was that the Western system was actually something that evolved"},{"startMs":6317040,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"whereas the Communist system was a rationalist construction that was imposed"},{"startMs":6322320,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"and they weren't the same thing, and so then I wondered, well"},{"startMs":6325940,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"what's Western culture grounded in and is there any reason to assume that that's real in any sense"},{"startMs":6332600,"durationMs":660,"subtitle":"and so,"},{"startMs":6334340,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"that's what took me into the study of the underlying stories"},{"startMs":6338900,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"fundemental stories upon which our culture, I believe, is based and some of those are very old"},{"startMs":6343820,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"I am going to tell you a Mesopotamian story, it's one of the oldest stories we know, I am going to tell you and Egyptian story"},{"startMs":6350580,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"Those are sources of our culture,"},{"startMs":6352740,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and I think that those stories are grounded in much older traditions"},{"startMs":6356820,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"and I think that they refer to something real"},{"startMs":6359680,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"actually real, now"},{"startMs":6362360,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"I already told you that,"},{"startMs":6364940,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"there are different ways of conceptualizing real"},{"startMs":6368980,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"and that, my initial hypothesis, presumption, axiom you might say is that"},{"startMs":6375140,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"pain is the most real, and the reason I believe that is because that is how people act"},{"startMs":6381320,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"Now, you can criticize that"},{"startMs":6383160,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"You can certainly come up with an alternate conceptual framework which the scientists have"},{"startMs":6388400,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"because they believe that the most real thing is matter"},{"startMs":6392960,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"maybe we need more than one set of tools to operate in the world"},{"startMs":6397060,"durationMs":1480,"subtitle":"it's possible"},{"startMs":6404540,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"So now I want to tell you what I think is the fundamental"},{"startMs":6408660,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"constituent elements are of"},{"startMs":6411640,"durationMs":1160,"subtitle":"stories"},{"startMs":6414100,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"and, one of the things that I hope is that"},{"startMs":6417720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"this, knowing this will make you"},{"startMs":6421560,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"immunize you against ideology"},{"startMs":6424980,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and the reason I'm, because I believe that ideologies are fragmentary"},{"startMs":6429820,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"meta-narratives and they have their power because"},{"startMs":6433580,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"they're grounded in the meta-narrative but they only tell part of the story"},{"startMs":6436900,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"but they have power, because they are grounded in the fundemental narrative"},{"startMs":6440560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and so, here is the fundamental narrative, the characters let's say"},{"startMs":6445420,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"we are going to say that"},{"startMs":6447660,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"people are prone to characterize the world, we are social primates"},{"startMs":6452140,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"we are social cognitive primates and we tend to see the world through the lens of a social creature"},{"startMs":6457440,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"and so, and partly because we're concerned with acting in the world and the world the world is mostly other people"},{"startMs":6463160,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"then we conceptualize the ground of that"},{"startMs":6466400,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"structure for action in characterological terms"},{"startMs":6473960,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"so the, the must fundamental reality is, chaos"},{"startMs":6479600,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"and chaos is what you don't understand at all"},{"startMs":6483760,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"You can't even conceptualize it"},{"startMs":6486900,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"you come into contact with it"},{"startMs":6489540,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"in bits and pieces"},{"startMs":6491580,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"when the towers fell, when the Twin Towers fell"},{"startMs":6494800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"chaos reigned for a few days, everyone was shell shocked"},{"startMs":6499400,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and that was chaos, and, chaos is what you experience when"},{"startMs":6503880,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"your story falls apart"},{"startMs":6505840,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"and that is a descent into the underworld"},{"startMs":6508560,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"that's chaos, and basically you live in order and chaos, and order is where, when you do"},{"startMs":6514300,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"what you think you should do, what you want to have have happen, happens"},{"startMs":6518120,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"that is order, that is explored territory"},{"startMs":6520820,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and chaos is when, you do what you are supposed to do"},{"startMs":6524300,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"to get what you want and it doesn't happen"},{"startMs":6527020,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and then that place that you are magically in when that happens, that's chaos"},{"startMs":6530920,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"and it has different depths, you could say"},{"startMs":6533500,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"it reaches all the way to Hell and that usually happens when"},{"startMs":6537240,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"your life falls apart very badly"},{"startMs":6539760,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and you are down in that chaos and you realize that it was your fault"},{"startMs":6543780,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"and that you did something wrong"},{"startMs":6545940,"durationMs":2300,"subtitle":"and that you knew it, and you ignored it"},{"startMs":6549320,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"That's the worst form of chaos"},{"startMs":6553820,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"So there is chaos itself and then"},{"startMs":6555980,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"then the next thing is fairly straightforward, you could think"},{"startMs":6560360,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"there is the individual"},{"startMs":6562020,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"the individual exists in culture"},{"startMs":6564260,"durationMs":1780,"subtitle":"and culture is embedded in nature"},{"startMs":6566040,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"pretty straightforward, nature is Mother Nature for reasons we will get into"},{"startMs":6570980,"durationMs":1500,"subtitle":"and culture is \"Father Culture\""},{"startMs":6572480,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"and I think that's because the fundamental dominance hierarchies"},{"startMs":6576640,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"in human primates are masculine"},{"startMs":6579700,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and that Nature is assimilated to the feminine because it's"},{"startMs":6583540,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"well for two reasons, first of all females do the sexual selection among human beings"},{"startMs":6588280,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"so that they are actually are nature from the Darwinian perspective"},{"startMs":6591080,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and second, nature is the productive biological force"},{"startMs":6596040,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"and so we have always conceptualized males and females and we used that conceptualization"},{"startMs":6601360,"durationMs":1940,"subtitle":"to sort out the world"},{"startMs":6604700,"durationMs":1060,"subtitle":"at large"},{"startMs":6606340,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"it's a metaphor"},{"startMs":6608000,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"but it's not just a metaphor, it's reasonable to consider"},{"startMs":6611840,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"culture as a judgmental father, it's really reasonable because"},{"startMs":6616200,"durationMs":560,"subtitle":"you know"},{"startMs":6617900,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"you have a group of people around you, some friends some people that watch you work, some judges"},{"startMs":6624220,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"and that stretches across a very long expanse of time , and"},{"startMs":6628600,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"those people as an aggregate, make an entity that"},{"startMs":6632680,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"is judging your reputation constantly"},{"startMs":6635360,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and it is perfectly reasonable to personify that because"},{"startMs":6639200,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"it's like a metaperson that is watching you"},{"startMs":6642380,"durationMs":960,"subtitle":"and so,"},{"startMs":6643340,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"it's a useful metaphor, there is a metaperson that is watching you"},{"startMs":6647640,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"Well, yeah there is, obviously"},{"startMs":6650280,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"so, now, you could say well that's not real, it's like,"},{"startMs":6656240,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"it's not real the way a scientific truth is real, it is a different kind of real"},{"startMs":6665200,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"Well nature has two elements, destructive and creative, obviously"},{"startMs":6669860,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"there is the beauty of nature in it's bountiful"},{"startMs":6673020,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"element and there is"},{"startMs":6675760,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"Anopheles mosquitoes and elephantiasis and cancer and"},{"startMs":6680780,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"starvation and all the terrible elements of nature"},{"startMs":6684220,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and then there is culture, and culture is tyrannical, because"},{"startMs":6688380,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"you have to shape yourself, involuntarily even to get along with other people, you sacrifice"},{"startMs":6693820,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"a lot of yourself, and develop yourself, but you sacrifice a lot of yourself"},{"startMs":6697620,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"in that endeavor, right we have to kind of average ourselves out in order to"},{"startMs":6702540,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"to live together, and some societies are more tyrannical that others"},{"startMs":6707160,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"but there is always a tyrannical element, you see that in university, you know, you guys know,"},{"startMs":6711640,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"that to some degree, this is such a big place"},{"startMs":6713540,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"it's easy to feel like a number here, and that, whether you are here or not doesn't matter"},{"startMs":6718060,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"the institution doesn't care, well that's the tyrannical element of it"},{"startMs":6722300,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"now it does care, because here you are and you are getting educated and all that"},{"startMs":6725800,"durationMs":1660,"subtitle":"and so maybe that's positive"},{"startMs":6728020,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"but it's got both, these characters always have two sides"},{"startMs":6733280,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you know, there's negative side and the positive side of nature"},{"startMs":6737520,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and there is the negative side and the positive side of culture and then there is the individual"},{"startMs":6742400,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"so the individual is like standing on an island in the midst of an ocean"},{"startMs":6746880,"durationMs":1060,"subtitle":"that's a good"},{"startMs":6749720,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"imagistic conceptualization of your position"},{"startMs":6752840,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"there is solid ground, it has a limited expanse and outside of that is everything you don't understand"},{"startMs":6759200,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"and you as an individual have a positive and a negative element as well"},{"startMs":6763380,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"and that's the hero and the villain"},{"startMs":6765540,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"and of course what good is a story without a hero and a villain"},{"startMs":6768380,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"and the villain is the person who isn't acting like a person should act and the hero is acting like a person should act"},{"startMs":6774840,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"and so when you go to movies and you read books and there are heroes and there is villians"},{"startMs":6779140,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"and to some degree what you are doing is fleshing out your notion of a villain"},{"startMs":6783420,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"you know you read about 30 villains and you think well there is something villainous about the villains"},{"startMs":6787900,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"that is the central element of villainy"},{"startMs":6790620,"durationMs":1300,"subtitle":"whatever that is"},{"startMs":6792340,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and, you can imagine you construct out a metavillain"},{"startMs":6795940,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"and a metahero, and those are the characters in"},{"startMs":6801020,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"religious stories, generally speaking"},{"startMs":6804620,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you know, and in the Marvel movies"},{"startMs":6809140,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"there is Odin, and Odin has two sons"},{"startMs":6812520,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"right, Thor and Loki, and Thor is like"},{"startMs":6821040,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"Thor is the world redeeming hero and Loki is the trickster who wants to bring everything down, and"},{"startMs":6828320,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"you have to recognize that in yourself"},{"startMs":6830880,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"or it's useful to because otherwise you underestimate"},{"startMs":6834640,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"[student entering] Is this positive psyche?"},{"startMs":6837660,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"No, it's Maps of

that...[laughter]"},{"startMs":6857660,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"Why might you be villainous?"},{"startMs":6861740,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"Well first of all because you can be,"},{"startMs":6864160,"durationMs":1540,"subtitle":"that 's a big deal"},{"startMs":6866100,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"you can be, it's actually an offshoot of empathy"},{"startMs":6869560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"this is something that took me decades to figure out"},{"startMs":6873000,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"I figured it out when I was studying the book of Genesis"},{"startMs":6876520,"durationMs":1420,"subtitle":"because in the book of Genesis"},{"startMs":6877940,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"people become self conscious, and they immediately have the knowledge of good and evil"},{"startMs":6882440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"I just couldn't figure that out, it's like what the hell is the relationship between that"},{"startMs":6887000,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"and then really, I tell you I thought about that for like 30 years"},{"startMs":6890580,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"trying to puzzle that out, and then I realized what it was"},{"startMs":6895180,"durationMs":1680,"subtitle":"If you are self conscious"},{"startMs":6898420,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"you can conceptualize yourself as a being"},{"startMs":6901560,"durationMs":1800,"subtitle":"you know that you are"},{"startMs":6903900,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"and you know what you're like"},{"startMs":6905880,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"and you know what hurts you and what doesn't"},{"startMs":6909980,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"and soon as you know what hurts

profound"},{"startMs":7758940,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"but it was a song that people liked and people still listen to, and"},{"startMs":7763880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"It's sets the tone for the movie, which is what music does"},{"startMs":7767640,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"one of the things that is really interesting about movies, that's really mysterious is that"},{"startMs":7772260,"durationMs":760,"subtitle":"you know,"},{"startMs":7773020,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"if you go to a movie, there is almost always a soundtrack"},{"startMs":7776720,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"right, if you go to movie and there isn't a soundtrack"},{"startMs":7779420,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"it kind of feels empty, it feels like there is something missing, and"},{"startMs":7782260,"durationMs":1700,"subtitle":"you know, it's as if the music"},{"startMs":7783960,"durationMs":2500,"subtitle":"You know, when you go to a movie there is lots of things you can't"},{"startMs":7786460,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"see, the characters are only partial, and"},{"startMs":7788780,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"you don't know anything about there background, so it's like a low resolution thing"},{"startMs":7792680,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and what seems to happen with the music is that it's provides the emotional background"},{"startMs":7796580,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"the complex context, let's say, it's like a substitute"},{"startMs":7801600,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"for the context and it guides you in your, in your perceptions of the movie"},{"startMs":7806480,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"it gives you hints about what is going to happen and,"},{"startMs":7808800,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and, the funny thing about that is that we just don't have any problem with that"},{"startMs":7813740,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"you know, it's like , yeah of course a movie has a soundtrack"},{"startMs":7817660,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and of course when there is a dramatic scene the music gets dramatic and"},{"startMs":7821260,"durationMs":1640,"subtitle":"but that doesn't happen in real life"},{"startMs":7822900,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"so you would wonder why we would accept it in a movie, and"},{"startMs":7825980,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"I think it is partly because we are willing to accept the amplification of reality"},{"startMs":7831420,"durationMs":1660,"subtitle":"that constitutes a movie"},{"startMs":7833080,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and in fact we find that compelling and music is one of the things that does that amplification"},{"startMs":7837820,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"the dramatization, and that's, that's acceptable to us"},{"startMs":7842200,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"This song I find quite

childish"},{"startMs":7855400,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"it's a childish song in some ways"},{"startMs":7858640,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"but,"},{"startMs":7860100,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"but that's OK, \"When you wish upon a star, it makes no difference who you

right"},{"startMs":7877020,"durationMs":800,"subtitle":"Why,"},{"startMs":7878840,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"do they do that?"},{"startMs":7882460,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"well,"},{"startMs":7885600,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and what is exactly is a star"},{"startMs":7887780,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"that's another question because"},{"startMs":7890240,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"there are stars that shine in the heavens"},{"startMs":7893020,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"and there are people who are stars"},{"startMs":7896760,"durationMs":600,"subtitle":"and so,"},{"startMs":7899060,"durationMs":1480,"subtitle":"Why are people stars?"},{"startMs":7900920,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"Well they are usually famous people, right, they are people that"},{"startMs":7904380,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"who attract a lot of attention"},{"startMs":7906380,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"and maybe they are people who, who have a lot of talent , that's a possibility"},{"startMs":7910100,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"Maybe they are models, I don't mean clothing models although sometimes they are, they are models for emulation"},{"startMs":7917100,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"that's what being a star means, that's why People magazine is full of stars"},{"startMs":7921220,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"it's like they're heroes brought to earth"},{"startMs":7925100,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"and of course you know nothing about them, all you know is their public persona"},{"startMs":7929100,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"and of course they are usually very attractive and so"},{"startMs":7932440,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"that allows you to project upon them all the things that go along with ideal humanity"},{"startMs":7939040,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"and so they are stars"},{"startMs":7941440,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"and, but still, why stars? well stars beckon in the darkness, right?"},{"startMs":7946080,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"and they are other worldly"},{"startMs":7947860,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"that's the thing that's cool, they are not of this earth"},{"startMs":7951800,"durationMs":1240,"subtitle":"and I mean that"},{"startMs":7953040,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"technically, because obviously they are not of this earth, but I also mean it"},{"startMs":7957920,"durationMs":840,"subtitle":"I mean it,"},{"startMs":7958760,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"phenomenologically, I mean it as an

of"},{"startMs":7969320,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"perhaps of the full night sky, and you know that is really to bad because"},{"startMs":7974080,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"the full night sky is one of those experiences that actually induces awe"},{"startMs":7979160,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"naturally, you know, and no wonder"},{"startMs":7981480,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"you look up there and there are just stars everywhere"},{"startMs":7984560,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"right, you are looking at the edge of the galaxy, that's

sure"},{"startMs":8003340,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and, you know, that produces a sense of awe in people, like looking at the Grand Canyon or something like that"},{"startMs":8008920,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"and, it's, you are looking at something that transcends yourself, but that feeling of awe, that seems to be something that's"},{"startMs":8015300,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"that's a natural part of our response"},{"startMs":8018740,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and, you know, you might feel awe when you meet someone that you regard as particularly admirable as well"},{"startMs":8024320,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"because you feel that there is something transcendent about them"},{"startMs":8026740,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"Here is an interesting thing to think about"},{"startMs":8031020,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"There are people you admire"},{"startMs":8033160,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"and there are people you don't admire"},{"startMs":8035640,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"and that's a clue right, that's a clue as to your value system, and"},{"startMs":8039220,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"it might be not something that you can really put your finger on, it's like, you find this person captivating, you find this person"},{"startMs":8045280,"durationMs":1240,"subtitle":"admirable"},{"startMs":8046520,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and it's as if there is something inside of you that is looking for what is admirable"},{"startMs":8050620,"durationMs":1660,"subtitle":"you know, assuming that you are"},{"startMs":8052400,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and that person who is admirable has a faculty, some faculty"},{"startMs":8056720,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"that you would like to have for yourself"},{"startMs":8058920,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"and so they are a model for emulation"},{"startMs":8061180,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and that's part of how people develop, you know, like little kids often develop little

a question and thinking about it"},{"startMs":8101420,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"You know, because, it's more like when you are asking yourself a question, it's contemplative"},{"startMs":8106860,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"Well, what do I find admirable?"},{"startMs":8109080,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"It's a question, you don't know,

up"},{"startMs":8117720,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"and, Oh yeah that's one, and you can write that down"},{"startMs":8120320,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"you get some idea of what your ideal is, you know and, and you have one likely"},{"startMs":8125580,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"and what your counter-ideal is"},{"startMs":8131100,"durationMs":840,"subtitle":"Star"},{"startMs":8131940,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"Well, to wish upon a star is to raise your eyes above the

that, and so, people wish upon a star"},{"startMs":8172420,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"because they have some intuition that aiming above the

an autobiography"},{"startMs":8204840,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"that's the past authoring, the other is that you write"},{"startMs":8207400,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"a plan for the future, that's the future authoring, I would recommend that you get started"},{"startMs":8210920,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"on those right now, like, not right now, but really soon because, they are harder than you think"},{"startMs":8217360,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and some of you are going to write like 15,000 words"},{"startMs":8220720,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"you are going to get sucked right in, this happens all the time, you are going to get sucked right into it"},{"startMs":8225880,"durationMs":660,"subtitle":"and so,"},{"startMs":8226540,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"you write an autobiography because you need to know where you are"},{"startMs":8230060,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"and who you are, right now, because how the hell are you going to plot a pathway to the future unless you know where you are"},{"startMs":8235960,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"and then you need to write about the future because"},{"startMs":8238720,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"you aren't going to hit something unless you aim at it"},{"startMs":8242440,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"that's for sure"},{"startMs":8243480,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and lot's of times people won't aim at what they want because they are afraid"},{"startMs":8247580,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"the reason they are afraid is because if you specify what you want you have specified your conditions of failure"},{"startMs":8253280,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"you know when you fail"},{"startMs":8254720,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"and it is better to just keep foggy, it's like, well I don't know if I am succeeding or failing but"},{"startMs":8259580,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"you know, I can't really tell. Well great! Except you can't hit anything you don't aim at"},{"startMs":8265580,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and so, the future authoring program is like a"},{"startMs":8269020,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"it's an attempt to have your articulate you character"},{"startMs":8272620,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"and so is the past authoring program. Who are you?"},{"startMs":8276620,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and, you know, the past authoring program asks you to break your life into"},{"startMs":8281420,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"epochs and then to write about the emotional, you know the things that you regard as important"},{"startMs":8288020,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"Important events that have shaped who you are, and"},{"startMs":8291380,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"you know, you may find that some of those, some of that writing makes you emotional, and I would say"},{"startMs":8296340,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"if you have a memory that is more than 18 months old, roughly speaking"},{"startMs":8299580,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and when you bring it to mind, it has an emotional impact"},{"startMs":8303260,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"especially a negative emotional impact"},{"startMs":8305440,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"it's like part of you soul is stuck back there"},{"startMs":8308700,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and, I know that that's a metaphorical way of thinking about, but what I mean is that"},{"startMs":8315040,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"The reason that you still experience the emotion is because you have not solved the problem that that situation"},{"startMs":8322040,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"faced you with, and it might be a real problem like maybe you got tangled up with someone"},{"startMs":8327000,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"who was really bad, and that's rough, man, because you have got to come up with a theory of malevolence to deal with"},{"startMs":8331240,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"something like that, and that's no joke"},{"startMs":8333500,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"but, if its still producing emotion, that means you have not solved the problem, and"},{"startMs":8338620,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"your brain is still tagging it as threat, it's a part of you territory that you did not master"},{"startMs":8344560,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"threat, threat, threat, threat"},{"startMs":8346720,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and until you take it apart, and articulation really helps that, writing really helps that"},{"startMs":8352100,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"then, you are not going to free yourself from it's grip"},{"startMs":8355700,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"and that, what might not be that pleasant, I mean this one of those situations where doing it"},{"startMs":8361160,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"tends to produce a decrement in peoples mood"},{"startMs":8364120,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"in the short term, but quite radical improvements 3 to 6 months down the road"},{"startMs":8369040,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"you know it is often the case that you unfortunately have to do something you don't want to do in order to progress"},{"startMs":8375060,"durationMs":2220,"subtitle":"it's very, very common"},{"startMs":8377280,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"so, and the future authoring program asks you about different dimensions of your life"},{"startMs":8382700,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"Like, because you're, you can think of yourself as a personality inside your head but,"},{"startMs":8388280,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"you are nested in systems that transcend you, and they are just as real as whatever is in your head, its like"},{"startMs":8394840,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"Well, what do you need for life?"},{"startMs":8398220,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Well, that's pretty easy actually, some friends"},{"startMs":8402220,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"that's a good thing, intimate relationship, that's a good thing,"},{"startMs":8406180,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"a

that's a good thing to work on,"},{"startMs":8416860,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"You need, you need some plan for your career, you have got to fit in somewhere that people regard as"},{"startMs":8423240,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"important and that they will trade with you so that you can live"},{"startMs":8426600,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you need something worthwhile

lots of people in, so it's worth thinking about so that's why we put it in there"},{"startMs":8443760,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"So then it's like, what the hell do you want?"},{"startMs":8445940,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"What do want from your friends?"},{"startMs":8448020,"durationMs":1340,"subtitle":"What do you want from your

on your character"},{"startMs":8477760,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and so, then it asks you to write for 15 minutes without thinking too much about grammer"},{"startMs":8484300,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"or sentence structure or any of that"},{"startMs":8486700,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"about what your life could be like in 3 to 5 years

them figure out what they wanted"},{"startMs":8497400,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and then, it asks you to do the same thing in reverse"},{"startMs":8501060,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"which is to think about"},{"startMs":8503960,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"the ways that you're radically insufficient and your faults"},{"startMs":8509040,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and everyone knows this I

you"},{"startMs":8725720,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"it lowers your overall stress load"},{"startMs":8728040,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"because your brain is kind of, I think it is calculating

you"},{"startMs":8787020,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"the grading load is too high to do it"},{"startMs":8789860,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"so, I thought well it is still worth doing, and because

like"},{"startMs":8799740,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"it's helpful, I think that you will find it very helpful, that is what students report"},{"startMs":8804240,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"and

this week"},{"startMs":8873040,"durationMs":600,"subtitle":"because"},{"startMs":8873640,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"it also works better if you do it over time, and it seems"},{"startMs":8877240,"durationMs":2100,"subtitle":"like in bursts of writing, you know"},{"startMs":8879340,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"and to sleep between episodes because that's when your

mind"},{"startMs":8915620,"durationMs":580,"subtitle":"so,"},{"startMs":8917100,"durationMs":960,"subtitle":"there is a test"},{"startMs":8918620,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"so there is these two"},{"startMs":8920760,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"assignments plus the essay"},{"startMs":8923480,"durationMs":640,"subtitle":"the essay"},{"startMs":8924520,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"can be

class"},{"startMs":8932340,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"so,"},{"startMs":8932980,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"it's an opportunity to"},{"startMs":8936640,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"write about

just"},{"startMs":8953980,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"a survey of what we have gone through"},{"startMs":8956960,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and so, I did that, I didn't have that to begin with

hard"},{"startMs":8976320,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"and so, hopefully the course lectures will help guide you through it, and"},{"startMs":8984980,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"and that's about that"},{"startMs":8987080,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"So I am going to tell you about a bunch of stories, and I am going to try and explain what they

them"},{"startMs":9024720,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"but they didn't know that they knew it"},{"startMs":9027300,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"so it makes sense, it clicks, it clicks"},{"startMs":9030160,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and you know to me what that means is that you have the information"},{"startMs":9035000,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"represented in you, in
