and"},{"startMs":223799,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"so what we do is what's called"},{"startMs":225400,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"regenerative medicine so we use"},{"startMs":227959,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"different types of regenerative"},{"startMs":229560,"durationMs":4679,"subtitle":"molecules whether that's stem cells

is"},{"startMs":242560,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"degradation of the joint cartilage loss"},{"startMs":244959,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"and you get inflammation and then she"},{"startMs":246560,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"also had some small tears in the tendons"},{"startMs":248840,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"around the joints and it bothered her"},{"startMs":250400,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"for 10 years as you know and she"},{"startMs":251799,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"couldn't garden and she lost to Garden"},{"startMs":253519,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"so what we did is we used an ultrasound"},{"startMs":256000,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"as you saw and we go directly into the"},{"startMs":257919,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"tears and into the joint where the"},{"startMs":259880,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"inflammation is to repair the tissue"},{"startMs":262120,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"back to a previous state and so that's"},{"startMs":263960,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"how it got rid of her chronic when was"},{"startMs":265520,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"the ultrasound for diagnosis Diagnostic"},{"startMs":268199,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"and intervention and intervention yeah"},{"startMs":270680,"durationMs":3799,"subtitle":"so how does the ultrasound intervene"},{"startMs":272680,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"because it allows us to guide the needle"},{"startMs":274479,"durationMs":4401,"subtitle":"directly into the area of damage right"},{"startMs":276720,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and how can you see what's damaged"},{"startMs":278880,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"because the ultrasound and that's the"},{"startMs":280440,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"skill so it's telling Gray from Gray"},{"startMs":282280,"durationMs":5639,"subtitle":"ultrasound and that's the steepest skill"},{"startMs":284320,"durationMs":5439,"subtitle":"set to give you an example I I

MRI"},{"startMs":296600,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"MRI was normal so they just did"},{"startMs":298280,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"cortisone they did physio was living"},{"startMs":299800,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"with chronic pain for 15 years and he's"},{"startMs":301560,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"arguably the most he's the

has"},{"startMs":306720,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"access to any doctor in the world right"},{"startMs":308440,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and so he found me and I flew down I did"},{"startMs":311360,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"an ultrasound and we did and we found"},{"startMs":313000,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"some small tears that were missed on MRI"},{"startMs":314479,"durationMs":2921,"subtitle":"and then we injected him similar to what"},{"startMs":315639,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"we did with Tammy and we fixed it but"},{"startMs":317400,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"it's the principle is the same which is"},{"startMs":319039,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"that sometimes you need to do diagnostic"},{"startMs":321240,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"Dynamic ultrasound to find the issue and"},{"startMs":324199,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"that's how did you learn to

that"},{"startMs":330360,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"we're training we're developing a"},{"startMs":331639,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"machine learning neural net to do that"},{"startMs":333600,"durationMs":2599,"subtitle":"but that hasn't been developed yet"},{"startMs":335000,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"that's actually something we're doing"},{"startMs":336199,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"because we're kind of set the standard"},{"startMs":337639,"durationMs":3321,"subtitle":"for it because my mentor Dr Anthony"},{"startMs":339400,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"Galia he was the first one in the world"},{"startMs":340960,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"to do this stuff he did it for Tiger"},{"startMs":342400,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"Woods Alex Rodriguez a lot of A-list"},{"startMs":344600,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"athletes so he was the one who taught me"},{"startMs":346479,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"all this and he was the one who"},{"startMs":347680,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"pioneered this field so I learned from"},{"startMs":350039,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"him and I was fortunate because I got to"},{"startMs":351560,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"learn from the best and because of that"},{"startMs":353479,"durationMs":3961,"subtitle":"I was able to kind of take it and"},{"startMs":355120,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"translate it into my own patients how"},{"startMs":357440,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"much exposure to image data did you have"},{"startMs":360120,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"to uh undertake in order to start to be"},{"startMs":362840,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"able to distinguish thousands of hours"},{"startMs":364639,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"thousands of yes it's it's not it's the"},{"startMs":367280,"durationMs":5319,"subtitle":"learning curve is so Steep and we have"},{"startMs":370199,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"ultrasonographers as if you remember I"},{"startMs":372599,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"brought her with me at the time who are"},{"startMs":374199,"durationMs":4041,"subtitle":"specially trained by us and they're the"},{"startMs":376120,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"ones who actually guide us because"},{"startMs":378240,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"there's so much Nuance between telling"},{"startMs":380960,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"what's a tear and what's not a tear that"},{"startMs":383080,"durationMs":3239,"subtitle":"you really need a specialist and"},{"startMs":384960,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"unfortunately most yeah and a really"},{"startMs":386319,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"trained specialist who actually knows"},{"startMs":388000,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"what they're doing I know there's huge"},{"startMs":389479,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"difference in Radiologists for example"},{"startMs":391160,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"in their diagnostic accuracy I know on"},{"startMs":393360,"durationMs":4399,"subtitle":"the AI front that they're they have"},{"startMs":395800,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"trained AI systems now from what I"},{"startMs":397759,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"understand to be able to be pretty good"},{"startMs":399120,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"at distinguishing like lung cancer"},{"startMs":400639,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"lesions for example yeah they're pretty"},{"startMs":402680,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"good at X-ray and cancer but muscular"},{"startMs":405759,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"scal is still a big gap and so that's"},{"startMs":407720,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"what we're developing because that's our"},{"startMs":408880,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"specialty is we're going to develop a"},{"startMs":410599,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"machine learning neural net using what's"},{"startMs":412800,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"called supervised and reinforcement"},{"startMs":414199,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"learning to teach to teach the machine"},{"startMs":416160,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"learning algorithm to detect what's a"},{"startMs":418080,"durationMs":2799,"subtitle":"tear and what's not a tear and then"},{"startMs":419400,"durationMs":2519,"subtitle":"guide the physician on how to do it so"},{"startMs":420879,"durationMs":3121,"subtitle":"that's kind of how we're going to scale"},{"startMs":421919,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"what we're doing and how how do you get"},{"startMs":424000,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"the data set set up properly because you"},{"startMs":426000,"durationMs":4039,"subtitle":"need a training if you're going to"},{"startMs":428120,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"reinforce the proper response you have"},{"startMs":430039,"durationMs":3081,"subtitle":"to be sure that the material that you're"},{"startMs":431560,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"training the machine on is actually"},{"startMs":433120,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"accurate how do you solve that problem"},{"startMs":435240,"durationMs":3079,"subtitle":"because we have a brilliant radiologist"},{"startMs":437000,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"on our team who's going to be training"},{"startMs":438319,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"the AI on what's not a tear and what's a"},{"startMs":440400,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"tear and then you have normal you you"},{"startMs":441919,"durationMs":3241,"subtitle":"have to first get 's more than one"},{"startMs":443360,"durationMs":3239,"subtitle":"radiologist no we're just going to use"},{"startMs":445160,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"the one who's specially trained by us"},{"startMs":446599,"durationMs":3241,"subtitle":"who does our msk interventions and"},{"startMs":448919,"durationMs":3441,"subtitle":"diagnos"},{"startMs":449840,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"and she's she's obviously exal at what"},{"startMs":452360,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"she does and she can train the AI to say"},{"startMs":455400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"but the a needs thousands of normal"},{"startMs":457120,"durationMs":3079,"subtitle":"before it can recognize abnormal and"},{"startMs":459000,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"that's that's the data sets that you"},{"startMs":460199,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"have to build into it first and then she"},{"startMs":462080,"durationMs":2959,"subtitle":"has to train it over time to say hey"},{"startMs":463960,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"this is a tear and this is not a tear"},{"startMs":465039,"durationMs":3201,"subtitle":"and then eventually it learns right"},{"startMs":466599,"durationMs":3801,"subtitle":"right right right and what did you"},{"startMs":468240,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"inject Tammy with so we use something"},{"startMs":470400,"durationMs":5359,"subtitle":"called exosomes so the way I explain"},{"startMs":473560,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"exosomes imagine if you're if you're"},{"startMs":475759,"durationMs":4761,"subtitle":"going so let's talk about stem cells"},{"startMs":477960,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"first to explain exosomes so most people"},{"startMs":480520,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"have a intuitive concept of stem cells"},{"startMs":483000,"durationMs":4039,"subtitle":"they understand that they rebuild tissue"},{"startMs":484720,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"or they repair tissue so they can come"},{"startMs":487039,"durationMs":5361,"subtitle":"from umbilical cord they can come from"},{"startMs":490240,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"fat they can come from the bone marrow"},{"startMs":492400,"durationMs":2919,"subtitle":"they can come from amniotic fluid"},{"startMs":494120,"durationMs":2639,"subtitle":"there's so many different sources where"},{"startMs":495319,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"we can get them we use something"},{"startMs":496759,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"specifically called mazeno stem cells"},{"startMs":498919,"durationMs":3521,"subtitle":"which is just an embryological term to"},{"startMs":500919,"durationMs":3481,"subtitle":"explain their origin of where they're"},{"startMs":502440,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"being derived from and so and the reason"},{"startMs":504400,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"we use maeno is because they're easy to"},{"startMs":506520,"durationMs":4519,"subtitle":"access so for example the most easiest"},{"startMs":508639,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"place to access is after birth right"},{"startMs":511039,"durationMs":3721,"subtitle":"that you take the umbilical core tissue"},{"startMs":512839,"durationMs":4601,"subtitle":"or you take the amniotic fluid and you"},{"startMs":514760,"durationMs":4279,"subtitle":"can isolate the meenal stem cells or"},{"startMs":517440,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"stromal cells is technically the right"},{"startMs":519039,"durationMs":5641,"subtitle":"word uh but anyway most people call stem"},{"startMs":521680,"durationMs":5719,"subtitle":"cells but msse for short and so what you"},{"startMs":524680,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"do is you isolate those and then you can"},{"startMs":527399,"durationMs":4081,"subtitle":"grow them in a lab for three to Fours"},{"startMs":529160,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"why are they in umbilical cord tissue"},{"startMs":531480,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"why yeah because there's a is there just"},{"startMs":534160,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"a rich source of uh repair and"},{"startMs":537880,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"regeneration uh of the meenal stem cells"},{"startMs":540360,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"from that so meaning the umbilical cord"},{"startMs":543440,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"tissue is just rich in M's so why"},{"startMs":546120,"durationMs":4839,"subtitle":"they're rich in M's well I read that"},{"startMs":548760,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"that babies actually send stem cells"},{"startMs":550959,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"into their mother's body to help the"},{"startMs":552519,"durationMs":4481,"subtitle":"mother repair her own tissue right yeah"},{"startMs":554800,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"there is that mechanism built in so I I"},{"startMs":557000,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"think a lot of it it's probably that"},{"startMs":558640,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"cross talk between the placenta and the"},{"startMs":560680,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"mother right so I believe and the cool"},{"startMs":564680,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"thing is your body has stem cells too"},{"startMs":566240,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"right so and you have stem cells in your"},{"startMs":568240,"durationMs":3159,"subtitle":"bone barrel and in your

the"},{"startMs":4461040,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"research end of things is that before"},{"startMs":4463360,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"before you do your intervention have"},{"startMs":4466040,"durationMs":4679,"subtitle":"them do a Big Five personality inventory"},{"startMs":4468600,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and then have them do it 6 months later"},{"startMs":4470719,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"and see if you get decreases in trait"},{"startMs":4472520,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"neuroticism right yeah right because if"},{"startMs":4474560,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"you did that would be absolutely"},{"startMs":4475920,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"fascinating if you could actually we are"},{"startMs":4477880,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"going to start a trial so I will include"},{"startMs":4479600,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"that because you bet use the big five"},{"startMs":4481360,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"aspect scale because it gives you more"},{"startMs":4483920,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"differentiated analysis but if you could"},{"startMs":4486360,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"show that you could decrease trait"},{"startMs":4487840,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"neuroticism with a physiological"},{"startMs":4489480,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"treatment like that that would be a"},{"startMs":4490719,"durationMs":3641,"subtitle":"major that would be a major Discovery"},{"startMs":4493000,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"yeah no I think that's great so what"},{"startMs":4494360,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"we're that's a resilience measure"},{"startMs":4495960,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"essentially right an emotional"},{"startMs":4497000,"durationMs":2679,"subtitle":"resilience and I get that feedback all"},{"startMs":4498360,"durationMs":3319,"subtitle":"the time my patients say that I have"},{"startMs":4499679,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"more resiliency what used to stress them"},{"startMs":4501679,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"out doesn't stress them out anymore and"},{"startMs":4503560,"durationMs":4079,"subtitle":"so I see that anecdotally so it'd be"},{"startMs":4505199,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"great to quantify that absolutely well"},{"startMs":4507639,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"and it would be quite the miracle if you"},{"startMs":4509080,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"could produce a transformation in a in a"},{"startMs":4511199,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"personality trait because neuroticism is"},{"startMs":4513000,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"actually very stable right right and so"},{"startMs":4515040,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"and very difficult well difficult to"},{"startMs":4518000,"durationMs":5719,"subtitle":"amarate goes along with stable but you"},{"startMs":4520159,"durationMs":5361,"subtitle":"know there is there is uh there are um"},{"startMs":4523719,"durationMs":4601,"subtitle":"other indications that such things are"},{"startMs":4525520,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"possible so for example a single dose of"},{"startMs":4528320,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"psilocybin that produces a mystical"},{"startMs":4530520,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"experience produces I believe it's a"},{"startMs":4532360,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"half standard no it's a one standard"},{"startMs":4535239,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"deviation increase in trade openness a"},{"startMs":4537920,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"year later that's permanent exactly"},{"startMs":4539800,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"right one standard deviation we you just"},{"startMs":4542360,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"well you just took the words out of my"},{"startMs":4543320,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"mouth because I was going to say we call"},{"startMs":4544560,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"this procedure the vshot the Vegas Nerf"},{"startMs":4547000,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"shot and basically we combine it with"},{"startMs":4549040,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"psilocybin assisted therapy a macro do"},{"startMs":4551360,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"and so that combination is so power ful"},{"startMs":4553480,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"to kind of reset their which do you do"},{"startMs":4555679,"durationMs":3801,"subtitle":"first uh we usually do this first and"},{"startMs":4557800,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"then send them off to therapy afterwards"},{"startMs":4559480,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"this the cybin therapy no we do our"},{"startMs":4561480,"durationMs":3159,"subtitle":"injection first calm down the nervous"},{"startMs":4562840,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"system and then afterwards they go off"},{"startMs":4564639,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"to therapy and do cocy yeah so they do"},{"startMs":4567280,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"the they do the the physiological"},{"startMs":4568960,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"intervention that decreases stress"},{"startMs":4570760,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"reactivity first right so that would"},{"startMs":4572679,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"also increase the probability that the"},{"startMs":4574520,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"experience they have with a"},{"startMs":4576239,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"hallucinogenic would be positive because"},{"startMs":4578239,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"their nervous systems are calmed down"},{"startMs":4580120,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"right because set matters right so if"},{"startMs":4581719,"durationMs":4321,"subtitle":"you're in an anxious state and you take"},{"startMs":4583760,"durationMs":3919,"subtitle":"a hallucinogenic the probability that"},{"startMs":4586040,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"that state will be magnified into"},{"startMs":4587679,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"something approximating a bad trip is"},{"startMs":4589480,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"very high yeah and so we wanted we're"},{"startMs":4591560,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"going to start a hopefully a phase one"},{"startMs":4592920,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"trial sometime next year for this"},{"startMs":4594560,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"intervention so we can actually get some"},{"startMs":4595880,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"real data behind it yeah yeah use the"},{"startMs":4598480,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"big five use the big five right that's"},{"startMs":4601080,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"great that's really powerful because if"},{"startMs":4602360,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"you get big five aspect scale right no"},{"startMs":4605000,"durationMs":3239,"subtitle":"that makes perfect sense yeah yeah well"},{"startMs":4606840,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"that would be really remarkable if you"},{"startMs":4608239,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"could manage that all right so you and"},{"startMs":4610760,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"what sort of what sort of effects have"},{"startMs":4612440,"durationMs":3719,"subtitle":"you seen with the people that

yeah"},{"startMs":4618400,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"no uh depression I think I think the big"},{"startMs":4620600,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"thing with that is combining it with"},{"startMs":4622040,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"that some sort of psilocybin or some"},{"startMs":4623719,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"sort of psychedelic assisted therapy

is"},{"startMs":4877960,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"quite remarkable a proxy right and yeah"},{"startMs":4880080,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"it's a proxy for muscular integ"},{"startMs":4881800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Integrity essentially yeah and so if you"},{"startMs":4883800,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"look at it if we can preserve

so"},{"startMs":4890360,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"fallatin is a peptide that's naturally"},{"startMs":4892080,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"made in your body and as you get

just"},{"startMs":4897199,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"delivering this through a gene therapy"},{"startMs":4898520,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"form the plasma vector and it

completely"},{"startMs":4903920,"durationMs":2759,"subtitle":"reversible if you want to have your body"},{"startMs":4905080,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"for whatever reason and it wears off on"},{"startMs":4906679,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"its own well what happens if you"},{"startMs":4907920,"durationMs":4719,"subtitle":"increase fallatin levels so it inhibits"},{"startMs":4910440,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"myostatin which is kind of the enzyme"},{"startMs":4912639,"durationMs":3321,"subtitle":"sets a limit on how much muscle you

increases"},{"startMs":4919000,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"why does it decrease with age because"},{"startMs":4921280,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"the aging process is cruel and so so"},{"startMs":4923960,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"many different peptides as you so you"},{"startMs":4925400,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"think it's just a consequent another"},{"startMs":4926960,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"element of degeneration exactly"},{"startMs":4928520,"durationMs":5119,"subtitle":"degeneration exactly and so entropy yeah"},{"startMs":4931760,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and so if we can restore it back to your"},{"startMs":4933639,"durationMs":3681,"subtitle":"levels your youthful levels not only"},{"startMs":4935600,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"will you inhibit mil stattin which makes"},{"startMs":4937320,"durationMs":4359,"subtitle":"it easier for your body to put on muscle"},{"startMs":4939400,"durationMs":3759,"subtitle":"it'll also activate what's called foxo3"},{"startMs":4941679,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"pathway which reduces systemic"},{"startMs":4943159,"durationMs":3761,"subtitle":"inflammation so it has this and so we"},{"startMs":4945239,"durationMs":4361,"subtitle":"showed in our phase one trial that"},{"startMs":4946920,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"patients over the age of 60 on average"},{"startMs":4949600,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"reduce their intrinsic biological age by"},{"startMs":4951520,"durationMs":4639,"subtitle":"12 years which is actually incredible"},{"startMs":4953960,"durationMs":4239,"subtitle":"wow that's 60 yeah and there was"},{"startMs":4956159,"durationMs":5201,"subtitle":"actually some hyperresponders who had"},{"startMs":4958199,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"biological age reduction of access of 60"},{"startMs":4961360,"durationMs":2879,"subtitle":"years which is crazy to believe so does"},{"startMs":4963239,"durationMs":2801,"subtitle":"that mean they're going to leave 60"},{"startMs":4964239,"durationMs":3881,"subtitle":"years longer we don't know that yet but"},{"startMs":4966040,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"they're tell probably not probably"},{"startMs":4968120,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"multiple Dimensions but still but but"},{"startMs":4970440,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"they T themir length which is a proxy we"},{"startMs":4972920,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"also set a world record for that as well"},{"startMs":4974760,"durationMs":4959,"subtitle":"you show Tel L increase as well in that"},{"startMs":4977080,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"patient who was a hyper responder and so"},{"startMs":4979719,"durationMs":3721,"subtitle":"we're actually applying W yeah so it's"},{"startMs":4981400,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"pretty powerful it's it's as another"},{"startMs":4983440,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"animal studies that have been done with"},{"startMs":4984760,"durationMs":3479,"subtitle":"thisat and gene therapy has been around"},{"startMs":4986400,"durationMs":4319,"subtitle":"for a while in animal studies what's it"},{"startMs":4988239,"durationMs":4561,"subtitle":"showed with animals similar 30% 32% life"},{"startMs":4990719,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"extension in in mice but actual life"},{"startMs":4992800,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"extension not just the markers no"},{"startMs":4994560,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"exactly life extension wow and so when"},{"startMs":4996760,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"people fast I mean I know animals that"},{"startMs":4999600,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"that are are starved to like 75% of"},{"startMs":5002080,"durationMs":3119,"subtitle":"their body weight they'll live 40%"},{"startMs":5003880,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"longer something like that does that"},{"startMs":5005199,"durationMs":4121,"subtitle":"have anything to do with with um yeah"},{"startMs":5007520,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"because it activates similar Pathways"},{"startMs":5009320,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"which are anti-inflammatory Pathways"},{"startMs":5010800,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"regenerate Pathways Pathways that

it"},{"startMs":5018360,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"affecting the Hallmarks of Aging so now"},{"startMs":5020400,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"we have an understanding of

first"},{"startMs":5031199,"durationMs":3361,"subtitle":"principles until recently now we"},{"startMs":5033320,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"understand there are what are

govern"},{"startMs":5042600,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"so that gets you to that gives you a"},{"startMs":5043880,"durationMs":4759,"subtitle":"foundation on how to interpret data

you"},{"startMs":5050199,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and so and where are you with this trial"},{"startMs":5052080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"so the phase two trial is going to start"},{"startMs":5053719,"durationMs":3841,"subtitle":"in Spring 2024 in Canada we have"},{"startMs":5056080,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"tentative approval we're just

what"},{"startMs":5077760,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"it does with people who are particularly"},{"startMs":5079320,"durationMs":3839,"subtitle":"old yeah exactly and that's where

the"},{"startMs":5087840,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"benefits of more energy more strength in"},{"startMs":5089679,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"the gym because obviously by

yes"},{"startMs":5129800,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"it's more powerful than minicircle our"},{"startMs":5131719,"durationMs":4201,"subtitle":"technology but it also has off-site"},{"startMs":5133840,"durationMs":3879,"subtitle":"targets so meaning it may hit it may do"},{"startMs":5135920,"durationMs":3319,"subtitle":"something that's unintended so and"},{"startMs":5137719,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"that's the risk with crisper whereas"},{"startMs":5139239,"durationMs":2761,"subtitle":"with the minicircle vector it's not

tissue"},{"startMs":5158679,"durationMs":4681,"subtitle":"engineering so we are talking about"},{"startMs":5161119,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"earlier can we regrow cartilage
