proposition"},{"startMs":624880,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"I think that modern people would have to add eating to that"},{"startMs":628360,"durationMs":8480,"subtitle":"because since the time of

pathologies"},{"startMs":639860,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"but that's in some sense beside the point."},{"startMs":643540,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"So that's one part of the Freudian

think of Jung, actually, as a deep archaeologist of the Id"},{"startMs":673300,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"And Freud though about the Id in sort of primordial terms"},{"startMs":677580,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"so his angry Id would be"},{"startMs":683820,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"like a beast that's out of control"},{"startMs":687040,"durationMs":8900,"subtitle":"but Jung recognized that the unconscious was far more sophisticated, in many ways"},{"startMs":695940,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"than the conscious parts of your being."},{"startMs":700820,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"And that it guided your adaptation in ways that you didn't

systems"},{"startMs":744820,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"so here's a way of thinking about it --and this is a way of thinking about the collective

war?'"},{"startMs":766360,"durationMs":6920,"subtitle":"or Venus as the god of love, actually of sexual attraction, more particularly"},{"startMs":773280,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"or of sexual possession, which is even a better way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":779220,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"And you say, 'well why would people conceptualize of those phenomena as

Shakespeare!

older, you or aggression?"},{"startMs":802040,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"And the answer to that is, well, you're 23"},{"startMs":805060,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and the system that mediates biological aggression in mammals and their progenitors"},{"startMs":810420,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"is tens of millions of years old."},{"startMs":815480,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"And if you

of it is that you don't control it at all"},{"startMs":828500,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"What happens is that you never go anywhere where you need to use it"},{"startMs":833100,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"And so one of the things that happens to soldiers in wartime, for example,"},{"startMs":836400,"durationMs":2500,"subtitle":"is they go somewhere

choice?"},{"startMs":866380,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"It doesn't look like a choice"},{"startMs":867980,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"I mean, if it's a choice it's often an incredibly self-destructive and idiotic choice"},{"startMs":873140,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"it's often one that ruins people's entire lives"},{"startMs":876280,"durationMs":2100,"subtitle":"It's more like a

more likely that an anti-depressant can help with that"},{"startMs":1154320,"durationMs":7340,"subtitle":"because in some sense what it's going to do is to readjust the reporting of your dominance

want"},{"startMs":1166080,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"You know, people say you should have self-esteem"},{"startMs":1168860,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"I would say, idiots say that you should have

much"},{"startMs":1206720,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"That's what would make you a narcisist."},{"startMs":1209480,"durationMs":9580,"subtitle":"So I would say your self-esteem should be roughly

least in part, on your competence."},{"startMs":1225240,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"And you shouldn't think that you're more competent than you

as competent as you are."},{"startMs":1234720,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"And sometimes that means that you're not competent at all because you don't know what you're

you're of lowly dominance status, which for example in some sense you guys are"},{"startMs":1255100,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"because you're young and, you know, you're starting your

psyche"},{"startMs":1277700,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"and for him the unconscious wasn't a repository of repressed experiences,"},{"startMs":1285480,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"and it wasn't a

representation"},{"startMs":1330680,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"that in part was a consequence of representation of those underlying behaviors"},{"startMs":1337240,"durationMs":2020,"subtitle":"So here's a way of thinking about it:"},{"startMs":1341120,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"We act in a human way, whatever that means"},{"startMs":1345080,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and we've been acting in a human way for as long as there's been human beings"},{"startMs":1349340,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and we've been acting in a mammalian way for as long as there's been mammals."},{"startMs":1354020,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"Now, human beings are quite peculiar creatures because, not only do we act, we also watch ourselves act"},{"startMs":1360140,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and we represent those actions"},{"startMs":1362540,"durationMs":14580,"subtitle":"And Jung believed that as a consequence of us manifesting a specific set of typically human behaviors over hundreds of thousands"},{"startMs":1377120,"durationMs":1880,"subtitle":"--or perhaps millions of years--"},{"startMs":1379580,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"we also evolved the cognitive apparatus that was capable of representing those patterns of behavior"},{"startMs":1385600,"durationMs":9000,"subtitle":"and that cognitive apparatus expressed the representations of those fundamental patterns of behavior in imagistic and symbolic form"},{"startMs":1394600,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"and the basic imagistic and symbolic form is something like drama."},{"startMs":1399760,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"Now, why would that be?"},{"startMs":1400960,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"Well, it's obvious in some sense"},{"startMs":1403360,"durationMs":1420,"subtitle":"What is drama?"},{"startMs":1405540,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"Drama is the representation, the abstract representation, of patterns of behavior"},{"startMs":1411540,"durationMs":1560,"subtitle":"That's what you do when you go to a movie"},{"startMs":1413100,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"You watch people manifest their characteristic behaviors."},{"startMs":1418040,"durationMs":9320,"subtitle":"And then you might note that there is characteristic, quasi unique patterns of behavior that are portrayed in drama."},{"startMs":1427860,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"So, for example, there's the bad guy, and he wears a black hat in a cowboy movie"},{"startMs":1432920,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and whenever you go to a movie it's pretty clear to you right away who the good guys are and the bad guys are"},{"startMs":1438760,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"and you accept the distinction between good and bad guys as an apriori acceptable distinction."},{"startMs":1445040,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"So Jung would say, 'well, that's the action of an archetype'"},{"startMs":1447720,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"what underlies that is the archetypal story of the hostile brothers"},{"startMs":1452100,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"and hostile brothers, for example, are Cain and Abel"},{"startMs":1455000,"durationMs":8040,"subtitle":"The story of Cain and Abel in Genesis, by the way, is really the second story that's in that origin myth"},{"startMs":1463040,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and it's the first story about real human beings, right?"},{"startMs":1467240,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"Because Adam and Eve, so to speak,
