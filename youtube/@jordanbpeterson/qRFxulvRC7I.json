it's any of those five things."},{"startMs":1553600,"durationMs":3069,"subtitle":"And so that's an interesting way of thinking about it too because one of the things it"},{"startMs":1556669,"durationMs":4801,"subtitle":"shows you is that you can disagree about what something is right at the level of
