it's quite a rapid response, it can be a very rapid response"},{"startMs":305540,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"now, one of the things that Sokolov..."},{"startMs":312360,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"yeah, that's right... noted was that if he..."},{"startMs":316560,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"if I sat you down, for example, and I put some headphones on you"},{"startMs":320000,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"and I played a tone to you that repeated, exactly the same tone that repeated at predictable intervals"},{"startMs":326860,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"that the first time you heard the tone you'd produce quite a spike in skin conductance"},{"startMs":330780,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and the next time a slightly smaller spike, and then the next time a slightly smaller spike"},{"startMs":335020,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"until after maybe you've heard it three or four times, you would not respond to it at all"},{"startMs":340800,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and that was often regarded as habituation"},{"startMs":344240,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and habituations is the same thing that you can see in snails, for example"},{"startMs":348440,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"and I'm using snails as an example, because they have very, very simple nervous systems"},{"startMs":353640,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"so if you take a snail and you poke it, then..."},{"startMs":356340,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"like it comes out of its shell and you poke it, it'll go back into its shell"},{"startMs":359520,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"and then it'll come out, and if you poke it again it'll go back into its shell"},{"startMs":363060,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"and it'll come out; but if you keep doing that, sooner or later the snail will just stop going in"},{"startMs":367820,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and you might think of that... it has been conceptualized as the simplest form of learning"},{"startMs":372600,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"habituation"},{"startMs":374600,"durationMs":7720,"subtitle":"and the behaviorists tend to presume that if a human being manifested a response that could be modeled by a simple organism"},{"startMs":382320,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"then the human being was using a response that was analogous to that of the simple organism"},{"startMs":386920,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"and sometimes that's true, and sometimes it's not, so..."},{"startMs":390480,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"for example, you have simple reflexes that, you know"},{"startMs":393140,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"if you put your hand on a hot stove, you'll jerk back, and that's quite a simple circuit"},{"startMs":397180,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"you'll move your hand back before the message gets to your brain"},{"startMs":400640,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"because the spinal cord is smart enough to mediate a reflex like that all by itself"},{"startMs":406620,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"so you know, your brains is actually quite distributed throughout your body, it's not just in your head like people tend to think"},{"startMs":412180,"durationMs":9180,"subtitle":"and so, we have conserved fast-acting reflexes at various levels of our nervous system"},{"startMs":421360,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"they aren't capable of sophisticated response, it's pretty much stimulus - response"},{"startMs":427720,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"thinking about it from the behavioral perspective"},{"startMs":429720,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"but they have as an advantage incredible speed, because they're just aren't that many neural connections between the stimulus and the response"},{"startMs":436200,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"and so, we have layers of response at different time frames"},{"startMs":441720,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"that help us match with the demands of the external environment"},{"startMs":446420,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"so Charles Darwin, for example, used to go into the, I think it was a museum in England, I don't remember the name of it"},{"startMs":451800,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"the snake in there, I believe it was a cobra,"},{"startMs":454340,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"and he'd stick his face up at the glass, and the cobra would strike at him"},{"startMs":457800,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"and he'd jerk back; and he tried many, many times to master that reflexive response to the snake, but there was no way"},{"startMs":464160,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"every time that thing struck at him, he'd jump backwards"},{"startMs":467600,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"well, you can imagine the survival utility in a reflex like that, but in reflexes in general"},{"startMs":473260,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"okay, so back to Sokolov"},{"startMs":476400,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"now, what he decided..."},{"startMs":479160,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"if you took that tone, and you did anything to it that was perceptible"},{"startMs":483080,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"right, because there's certain gradations of tone that you're not capable of perceiving"},{"startMs":488440,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"but let's assume you took the tone, and you would adjust it enough so that it was perceptibly louder"},{"startMs":492940,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"or it was perceptibly a different frequency, or something like that"},{"startMs":496760,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"or even that the spaces between the tones"},{"startMs":499580,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"'cause I said they were predictably spaced"},{"startMs":501740,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"even if the spaces between the tones were changed"},{"startMs":505260,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"then, when the change occurred, the orienting reflex would be reinstated, you'd respond to it again"},{"startMs":511620,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and Sokolov tried to vary the tone on many, many parameters"},{"startMs":516180,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"but no matter what parameter he varied it on, as long as you could detect it perceptibly"},{"startMs":522100,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"you'd produce an orienting reflex; so Sokolov's idea was that"},{"startMs":525820,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you must be producing a complex internal model of the world"},{"startMs":530060,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"that's in concordance with the world across pretty much every perceptible dimension"},{"startMs":534700,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"because if you weren't doing that, how in the world would you know that the tone had changed from what you had already learned about it?"},{"startMs":541920,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"and so, for the longest time, and this was also true for people who were investigating artificial intelligence"},{"startMs":547620,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"we had this idea that what people did was make a complex model of the world, and hold it in their minds, so to speak"},{"startMs":554180,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"and then they'd act in the world, and they compared what they expected to happen in the world with the model"},{"startMs":560380,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"and as long as there was a match, then there was no orienting reflex"},{"startMs":563480,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"now, the orienting reflex turns out to be quite a complex reflex, it's not merely an alteration in skin conductance"},{"startMs":569340,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"what it is in essence is the manner in which you start to unfold your response to the unknown"},{"startMs":576860,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"and the initial stages of that are very, very quick"},{"startMs":579980,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"but it's hard to tell when the orienting reflex stops, and when more complex learning begins"},{"startMs":586080,"durationMs":2140,"subtitle":"they sort of shade into one another"},{"startMs":588220,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"so the initial stages of the orienting reflex are quite reflexive"},{"startMs":591940,"durationMs":11380,"subtitle":"but the later stages can be extraordinarily complex, so for example..."},{"startMs":603320,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"well, I always think the example of betrayal is the best one, because it's so complex"},{"startMs":609300,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"so imagine that you know, you come home and you find evidence, lipstick or something like that"},{"startMs":615400,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"evidence that the person that you're with is betraying you"},{"startMs":619280,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"the first thing that's going to happen is that you're going to orient, there's going to be a real shock, and that's reflexive"},{"startMs":624020,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"it's very much akin to the response that you would manifest if you saw a predator, or a snake, or something like that"},{"startMs":631400,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"so that's very instantaneous, you know"},{"startMs":634780,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"and then that'll prepare you for action, you'll get ready to do whatever it is that you need to do next"},{"startMs":640380,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"a very unpleasant thing; but then"},{"startMs":643080,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"it might take you even years to fully manifest the learning that would be necessary in a situation like that"},{"startMs":650160,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"because there's so many things that you have to reconsider"},{"startMs":653640,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"first of all, the person might now appear to you as a threat, that's pretty immediate"},{"startMs":657900,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"so there's a biological, physiological response first, your body reacts first"},{"startMs":662360,"durationMs":9040,"subtitle":"then you respond emotionally, that's gonna take a while, and you know, the emotional response might extend over days, or weeks, or months, or even years"},{"startMs":671400,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and then, as you're doing that as well, you're going to try to start to re-sort out your interpretive schema"},{"startMs":677160,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"so that it can adjust to the transformation that this..."},{"startMs":682060,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"this error on your part, say, or this catastrophe, or this betrayal"},{"startMs":686660,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"it has to adjust to whatever information that event contains"},{"startMs":691020,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"and so the orienting reflex can manifest itself over an extraordinarily long period of time"},{"startMs":696880,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"it's best to think about it as the initial part of what can be a very complex learning process"},{"startMs":703100,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"now, that was a standard idea in psychology for the longest period of time"},{"startMs":710240,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"that we created a detailed internal model of the world"},{"startMs":714300,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"and we watched how the world was unfolding, we compared the two"},{"startMs":718580,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"and the physiology, the neurophysiology of this was even understood to some degree, even by the Russians"},{"startMs":724480,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"in the early 1960s, because they basially localized..."},{"startMs":727680,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"you could use complex EEG, electroencephalogram technology"},{"startMs":732280,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"to localize where the orienting reflex was occurring in the brain, and basically it appeared to occur, roughly speaking, in the hippocampus"},{"startMs":739560,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"and the theory arose that your brain, your cortex, let's say, produced a very complex model of the world"},{"startMs":745720,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"an internal model; and your sense were producing a model of the external world"},{"startMs":750380,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and the hippocampus was watching those things to see if they matched"},{"startMs":754480,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"and if they didn't match, there was a mismatch signal, and that would be the orienting reflex"},{"startMs":758540,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"and then your body would start to prepare itself for whatever that mismatch meant"},{"startMs":764620,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and then you would engage in exploratory behavior to try to update your model"},{"startMs":769340,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"that was the standard theory, it was a very well accepted theory"},{"startMs":773400,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"it has elements of cybernetic theory in it"},{"startMs":776220,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"but it was accepted enough so that when people first started to experiment with artificial intelligence"},{"startMs":783040,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"that's how they tried to make artificially intelligent systems"},{"startMs":785980,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"they tried to make ones that would model the world, and then act, and then compare the changes in the world to that model"},{"startMs":792280,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"but that didn't go anywhere, it turned out, because it turned out that"},{"startMs":795580,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"it's so difficult to see and model the world that people had no idea how complex that was"},{"startMs":802380,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"it was impossibly complex, as it turned out, and so that's part of the reason"},{"startMs":806900,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"we don't have robots wandering around, doing apparently simple things like walking"},{"startMs":810980,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"walking in an environment like this"},{"startMs":813180,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"now, when we look at the environment, we think: well, it's not that hard to look at, it's full of objects"},{"startMs":819400,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"they're just self-evident, there they are, and we can just wander through it"},{"startMs":823400,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"you know, and we don't even do that consciously to any great degree"},{"startMs":827160,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"because so much of that perception is presented to our consciousness without effort"},{"startMs":832300,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"in some sense; but the AI guys learned pretty quick that perceiving the world was waaay more difficult than anybody had guessed"},{"startMs":839780,"durationMs":9040,"subtitle":"and then this experiment really in some sense put a phenomenological punch behind that observation"},{"startMs":848820,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"because one of the presuppositions of the orienting reflex theory that I just laid out was that:"},{"startMs":855060,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you were very good at detecting changes"},{"startMs":858420,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"that your nervous system would automatically detect change, anomaly"},{"startMs":861860,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"right, any mismatch between your model and what you expected, and then"},{"startMs":866420,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"well, the AI guys, I think, figured out first of all that was a big problem"},{"startMs":870480,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"that the problem of perception was much more complicated than that"},{"startMs":874320,"durationMs":8260,"subtitle":"you know, it's actually... it's out of that same set of observations in some sense that Postmodernism emerged in liternature..."},{"startMs":882640,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"in literary criticism, because, well"},{"startMs":885540,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"it turns out to be hard enough to see a normal object, like a chair"},{"startMs":890000,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"and part of that is that if you just do that to the chair, it's really different than it was before"},{"startMs":895660,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"you could imagine, how different it would be if you tried to paint the chair under both those conditions, right"},{"startMs":900860,"durationMs":3060,"subtitle":"if you really got good at looking at it you'd find that"},{"startMs":903920,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"even though, if I asked you what color this is, you'd say white"},{"startMs":907420,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"if you were actually painting it, you'd find out that the colors of the chair when it's in that location"},{"startMs":913360,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and the colors in the chair when it's in that location, just because of the difference in lighting"},{"startMs":917520,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"are substantially different"},{"startMs":919520,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"I think it was Monet, I think"},{"startMs":921960,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"who painted a very large series of haystacks in the French countryside in different seasons and under different conditions of illumination"},{"startMs":929560,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"just because he was exploring how radically different the same object could be as it moved through contexts"},{"startMs":935880,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"so it isn't even obvious why we think this is the same object when you move it"},{"startMs":940600,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"and the answer is something like: well, you can sit on it in both positions"},{"startMs":944720,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"which is not a description of an object, by the way"},{"startMs":947880,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"right? that's a description of something that's useful, something that's a tool, something that exists in relationship to your body"},{"startMs":954400,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"it's not an object; and so..."},{"startMs":957120,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"if you think that just looking at something like a chair is almost impossibly difficult"},{"startMs":962040,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"and subject to interpretation"},{"startMs":964320,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"then imagine how difficult it is to perceive something like a text, you know, like a novel"},{"startMs":969520,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"because a novel obviously is subject to multiple interpretations"},{"startMs":974200,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and the interpretations are gonna depend on, well, at least in principle"},{"startMs":978580,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"on the

read fifty Russian novels"},{"startMs":1022920,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"you're going to be in a much more different interpretive space"},{"startMs":1028440,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"than you are if, say, the Russian novel is the first novel you've ever read"},{"startMs":1033100,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"and the Postmodernists were grappling with this"},{"startMs":1037640,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"as well as with many other ideas that I think contaminated their thinking"},{"startMs":1043300,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and their conclusion was: well, you can't extract out a canonical meaning from a text"},{"startMs":1048480,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"it's so dependent on the situation that to say the text has an interpretable meaning is actually an error, now"},{"startMs":1056440,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"just because it's difficult to do something doesn't mean it's impossible"},{"startMs":1060080,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and there's massive holes in the postmodernist view"},{"startMs":1064180,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"I think it's an unbelievably pathological view, personally"},{"startMs":1067900,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"but the thing is is that there are reasons why it emerged"},{"startMs":1072600,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and the reasons were analogous to the reasons that the AI project initially failed"},{"startMs":1077260,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"and analogous to the reasons that this experiment turned out the way it did"},{"startMs":1081960,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"so I'm gonna show you this, many of you have seen this already, but as I said, it doesn't matter"},{"startMs":1086860,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"your job here is to count the times... there's a team of three people here, dressed in white"},{"startMs":1093080,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"and there's a team of three people here dressed in black"},{"startMs":1096040,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"and your job is to count the number of times the white team throws the baskeball back and forth to the white team members"},{"startMs":1102560,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"ok, we'll just run that"},{"startMs":1136000,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"okay, well, so, obviously"},{"startMs":1138280,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"or perhaps not so obviously, the"},{"startMs":1143060,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"the number of times I believe that they threw it back and forth was sixteen, if I remember this correctly"},{"startMs":1149040,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"but of course that's not really the issue, because what happens in the middle of the scene is that"},{"startMs":1154660,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"a guy wearing a gorilla suit comes out into the middle of the screen, and pounds his chest three or four times"},{"startMs":1160680,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"he comes out quite slowly, as you saw; is there anybody in here who didn't see the gorilla?"},{"startMs":1166020,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"no, well, I presume all of you knew about this video anyways"},{"startMs":1170060,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"so, Dan Simon, who produced this video has got a couple of other ones"},{"startMs":1174260,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"where he shows that, you know, even if you're smart enough to see the gorilla, 'cause you've seen the video before you've heard about it"},{"startMs":1180980,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"if you make other changes in the background, you'll count properly and you'll catch the gorilla, but you'll miss the other changes in the background"},{"startMs":1187220,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"and they're not trivial either, it's really quite remarkable"},{"startMs":1189960,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"he's produced other short videos, for example, where you'll be looking at a... like a field"},{"startMs":1196400,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"and a road will grow in it, occupying about a third of the photograph's space"},{"startMs":1202260,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"and you'd think well, yeah, you're gonna see that, it's like: you don't, you don't"},{"startMs":1205520,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"so, okay, so this threw a big spanner into the works"},{"startMs":1210120,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"this sort of experiment, along with the AI failures, and we could even say, the postmodern dilemma"},{"startMs":1215440,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"it's like, well, hmm, everyone, virtually..."},{"startMs":1219180,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"every psychologist would've predicted before this series of experiments that there's no damn way you'd miss that gorilla"},{"startMs":1225680,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"because your nervous system was actually attuned to change in the environment"},{"startMs":1229760,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"and that's a big change, and it's also a gorilla"},{"startMs":1232600,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"it's something you would really think that you couldn't miss, you couldn't possibly miss"},{"startMs":1237300,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"especially when it's occupying the center of the visual field"},{"startMs":1241700,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"and so, well, this is part of a phenomena called change blindness"},{"startMs":1245880,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"and it helped psychologists who had been studying the visual system for a very long time"},{"startMs":1250980,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"to figure out, well mostly figure out exactly how blind human beings are"},{"startMs":1256480,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"because we're way blinder than we think, and"},{"startMs":1259720,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and so we actually focus on much less of the world than we think, and"},{"startMs":1263980,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"we do that partly... it's not exactly obvious how we do it"},{"startMs":1268480,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"it's kinda like we hold a still picture in our imagination"},{"startMs":1272320,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"and then fill in the details by using our central foveal vision"},{"startMs":1275660,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"which is always dancing around like a pinpoint or a laser beam, moving back and forth"},{"startMs":1280820,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"and we're assembling those little snapshots from the fovea into a relatively coherent picture"},{"startMs":1287580,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"maybe what happens is that I look at you, and then I look at you [points to a different student]"},{"startMs":1292180,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"and I've still got the information from looking at you, so my brain can sort of infer that that's remained stable"},{"startMs":1298540,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"but like if I look at you, and I..."},{"startMs":1300960,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"I tried to learn how to do this, 'cause you can look at something, and then pay attention to the periphery, it's annoying"},{"startMs":1307280,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"but, so if I'm looking at you, I really can't make out your eyes [points to a different student]"},{"startMs":1312620,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"I can more or less make out the fact that you have a head"},{"startMs":1315760,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"especially if you move it, so your periphery is sory of like frog vision or dinosaur vision"},{"startMs":1322380,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"it's much better at picking up movement than it is at picking up something that's staying still"},{"startMs":1326840,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"and that makes sense, because, well, if it's staying still, and it hasn't already hurt you, then"},{"startMs":1333040,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"it's probably not going to hurt you; but if it's moving, then, you know, that's a good thing that you might pay attention to"},{"startMs":1338780,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and so, if your periphery catches movement, then you'll focus your fovea on it"},{"startMs":1342700,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"it's like you go from really low resolution to really high resolution"},{"startMs":1346900,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"so the center of your vision is incredibly high resolution"},{"startMs":1350000,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"but then it fades into low resolution as you move towards the periphery, until it's out here"},{"startMs":1354980,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"which would be about 170 degrees"},{"startMs":1358500,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"if I concentrate on this hand I can tell it's a hand, mostly when it's moving"},{"startMs":1364080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"I have no idea what color it is, this one I can't see at all"},{"startMs":1368080,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"and then, I can probably see my fingers - now"},{"startMs":1373700,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"and then I can clearly see them if I look at them with my fovea, and so"},{"startMs":1378140,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"your vision is a very, very strange thing, and it's focusing on something very specific"},{"startMs":1383600,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and so you're pointing your eyes at something very specific, and that's what you seem to see"},{"startMs":1388980,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"so then that opens up a whole new universe of questions, it's like..."},{"startMs":1394040,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"how do you decide what to point your eyes at?"},{"startMs":1396900,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"that turns out to be an insanely complicated problem"},{"startMs":1401340,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"John Vervaeke talks about that all the time as the problem of relevance"},{"startMs":1405280,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"and the issue is: well, there's many, many things in the world, there's an infinite number of things, let's say"},{"startMs":1411480,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"and you're not gonna be able to see them, that's for sure, even if they happen to be changing, as it turns out"},{"startMs":1417080,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"and so, out of this mess, first of all, how do you pick what to look at?"},{"startMs":1421040,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"and second, even if you do pick it, how do you see it? 'cause it's so crazily complicated"},{"startMs":1426180,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"so that's the problem that we're going to try to unpack"},{"startMs":1429780,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"now, roughly speaking, what seems to have happened with the gorilla video is"},{"startMs":1434080,"durationMs":6740,"subtitle":"you have to take that first theory, that you make a complete model of the world"},{"startMs":1440820,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"which is the objects in the world, and how they're interacting"},{"startMs":1444640,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and you compare that to the objects in the actual world and how they're interacting"},{"startMs":1448080,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"you have to modify that model, you say: well, no, you're certainly not making a complete model"},{"startMs":1453360,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and people should have known better anyways; even subjects to the limits of your perception, because"},{"startMs":1458180,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"there's all sorts of things in the world that you can't directly perceive, but"},{"startMs":1462680,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"what you're doing instead is something like: you're making a partial model of the world"},{"startMs":1468140,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"but you're only making a partial model of the world that you're currently operating on"},{"startMs":1473300,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"with some goal in mind"},{"startMs":1475300,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"and you're also comparing that to a model of the world as it's currently unfolding"},{"startMs":1479340,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"'cause the other thing that was implicit... this is really tricky, this is where you have to watch your implicit assumptions"},{"startMs":1485000,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"the other thing that was implicit in the original cybernetic theory was that"},{"startMs":1490620,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"you have a model of the world that's complete"},{"startMs":1494460,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"and then what you're watching is the actual world as it unfolds"},{"startMs":1498280,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"and that's not a model, that's just your perception of the object; but that also turns out to be wrong, because"},{"startMs":1504360,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"your perception of the world as it unfolds is also a model, and so"},{"startMs":1508640,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"what's happening is: you look at the world"},{"startMs":1511600,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"the world you see is a model, and a very partial model at that"},{"startMs":1515740,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"and then you compare it to the model that you expect or desire, more accurately, desire"},{"startMs":1520980,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"although the initial models were expectation"},{"startMs":1523860,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"because if you're in the lab, listening to tones it's not like you desire anything"},{"startMs":1527460,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"but mostly when you're acting in the world, you have desires"},{"startMs":1531240,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"so the experimental constraints skewed the data in some sense by making people assume that"},{"startMs":1538060,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"what people were doing when they walked through the world was expecting instead of desiring"},{"startMs":1542640,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"anyways, you have a model of the world that's generated as you look at it"},{"startMs":1546280,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"you have another model of the world that's something like the world that you desire"},{"startMs":1549820,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"then you compare both of them, and they can mismatch, and they can mismatch in a way that upsets your current pursuit"},{"startMs":1556380,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"that's the critical issue"},{"startMs":1558380,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"you don't see the anomaly unless it upsets your current pursuit"},{"startMs":1562660,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and you kinda know that too, because when you're..."},{"startMs":1564660,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"like, while I'm lecturing to you guys"},{"startMs":1567580,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"you know, mostly you're sitting still, but people are moving their arms, and they're moving their glasses, and they're shifting their feet, and"},{"startMs":1574900,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"generally I don't see any of that, because what difference does it make?"},{"startMs":1579880,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"you know, it's not relevant to the ongoing... to the ongoing what?"},{"startMs":1585580,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"ongoing contract? the ongoig series of interactions? it's something like that"},{"startMs":1590120,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"so as long as you keep your movements bounded"},{"startMs":1593480,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"within a range that doesn't interfere with whatever it is we're doing"},{"startMs":1598340,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"then it's going to be as invisible to me as the gorilla was when you were counting the balls"},{"startMs":1603520,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"and the cool thing is about the gorilla experiment, or one of them, is that"},{"startMs":1606980,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"the reason you were blind to the gorilla was because you were counting the balls"},{"startMs":1611160,"durationMs":7780,"subtitle":"and so, that's so fascinating , because what it shows to a huge degree, to an unfathomable degree"},{"startMs":1618940,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"to an unfathomable degree is that"},{"startMs":1623840,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"the value structure that you inhabit determines what you perceive"},{"startMs":1627100,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"it doesn't just determine what you expect or want, it bloody well determines what you see"},{"startMs":1632780,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and that makes the world a completely different place, no one really expected that"},{"startMs":1637100,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"and so, if you watch the basketball, you see the basketball"},{"startMs":1642580,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"if you stop watching the basketball, well then you see the gorilla, and so"},{"startMs":1646880,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"the first question that arises from an experiment like that is:"},{"startMs":1650780,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"just exactly what is it that you don't see in the world? and the answer is: all of it"},{"startMs":1656600,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"you see so little it's unbelievable; you see that tiny amount that's necessary"},{"startMs":1661780,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"for you to undertake the next sequence in your plotted movements...?"},{"startMs":1666800,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"it's something like that; but then that becomes very complicated, too, because"},{"startMs":1670860,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"it isn't obvious how you can conceptualize or how you can determine what your next movement is"},{"startMs":1677820,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"because it's not like you just add up movements and make up your life"},{"startMs":1682080,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"it's not that simple, and it's related to the novel problem, the problem of meaning in a literary work"},{"startMs":1689680,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"so imagine: you're trying to specify the meaning of a literary work, well"},{"startMs":1695120,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"there's meaning in the word, but the meaning of the word is dependent on the phrase within which it's embedded"},{"startMs":1702080,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and then the meaning of the phrase is dependent on the sentence that it's embedded in"},{"startMs":1706800,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and the sentence in the paragraph, and the paragraph in the chapter, and the chapter in the book"},{"startMs":1711180,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"and the book in the corpus of books of that sort"},{"startMs":1714360,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"and then within the culture, and then within whatever your peculiar personal experience is"},{"startMs":1720220,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"all of those things, nested, are operative to some degree when you're extracting out the meaning at any level of analysis"},{"startMs":1727020,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"they're all operating simultaneously, so you might say, well"},{"startMs":1729740,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"what are you doing in this classroom?"},{"startMs":1732740,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"well, the answer is: sitting in a chair"},{"startMs":1736340,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"but that's... obviously that's a very short-term and context-independent answer"},{"startMs":1743580,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"but you're also attending to what I'm saying, hypothetically"},{"startMs":1747500,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and you're attending to some of it, and not to other parts, you're thinking about some parts and not other parts"},{"startMs":1753080,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and you're also attending a class, and a class is a sequence of lectures"},{"startMs":1758720,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"and that's embedded within your desire to finish up the semester"},{"startMs":1762040,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"and then to finish up the year, and then to get your degree"},{"startMs":1765080,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"and then you nest that inside whatever it is, whatever the reason it is that you're getting your degree"},{"startMs":1770580,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and then maybe that's nested inside your career goals, and that's nested inside your life goals"},{"startMs":1775400,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"and that's nested inside your ultimate values, which you may or may not even be aware of"},{"startMs":1780380,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and so, I could say, well, you're sitting here because it serves your ultimate values"},{"startMs":1786060,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"well, that's true"},{"startMs":1789040,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"it seems a bit abstract to be useful, right, it's so vague out at the outermost levels, that"},{"startMs":1796240,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"it doesn't really have much specificity, right, so it seems to lack information, but"},{"startMs":1800520,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"by the same token if I said what you're doing is sitting there"},{"startMs":1803500,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"it has the same problem of too restricted meaning, because of overspecificity"},{"startMs":1808860,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"and so, there's some level in there that you would interpret as meaningful, God only knows why"},{"startMs":1815540,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"and that's the level... there's a natural level of perception for that sort of thing"},{"startMs":1820240,"durationMs":7140,"subtitle":"so for example, when children learn to name an animal, for example, they'll name \"cat\""},{"startMs":1827380,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"they don't name the species of cat, or the subspecies of cat"},{"startMs":1831400,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"and they don't confuse cats with dogs, even though they're both in the category of \"four-legged furry mammal\""},{"startMs":1838020,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"so, why not call the cat and the dog \"furry mammals\"?"},{"startMs":1843280,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"well, children don't do that, they go to \"cat\" and \"dog\""},{"startMs":1846700,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"and people who've studied the acquisition of language have found that there are basic-level categories that children pick up first"},{"startMs":1854300,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"and they're often represented with short words, and the words are short, because they've been around a long time"},{"startMs":1860400,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"because they seem to reflect the natural level at which people perceive the world"},{"startMs":1864800,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"but none of that's obvious, you know"},{"startMs":1868320,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"I mean you could just lump all animals together, for that matter, and just call them \"animals\", which we do sometimes"},{"startMs":1874400,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"so..."},{"startMs":1876160,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"anyways, so it's very difficult to specify the meaning level, and it's not very easy at all to figure out how we do it"},{"startMs":1881760,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"and so that's partly what I'm trying to unpack, so..."},{"startMs":1886960,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"here's part of the issue, so let's say that you're... you have a computer"},{"startMs":1892700,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"yeah, I have a story for this, so"},{"startMs":1896700,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"one time, when I was in Montreal, I was using my computer"},{"startMs":1902340,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"I was in my apartment"},{"startMs":1904340,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"and I was typing out an essay, and it crashed, and so"},{"startMs":1909820,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"what happens when your computer crashes? well, you know, usually you utter some sort of curse"},{"startMs":1914840,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"and it's interesting that you do that, because the circuit that you use to curse with"},{"startMs":1920400,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"is the same circuit that monkeys use to detect eagles, or leopards, or snakes"},{"startMs":1926040,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and so, when there's a bunch of monkeys together"},{"startMs":1929320,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"you know, they're not all preyed on by eagles and leopards and snakes, but"},{"startMs":1932540,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"you know, there's usually a predator in that category for every single monkey population"},{"startMs":1936600,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"and so, when the monkeys are watching, they have an emotional utterance that the most nervous monkey might utter first"},{"startMs":1943720,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"that basically says, you know, hide from the eagle; get out on the thin branch, so the cougar can't eat you; and look the hell out for the snake"},{"startMs":1951340,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"but there's a circuit that's linked

out"},{"startMs":2054360,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"none of the street light were working, the power was out everywhere"},{"startMs":2057260,"durationMs":8540,"subtitle":"and it was seriously out,

posit that"},{"startMs":3608200,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"stories about the nature of reality that existed before 500 years ago"},{"startMs":3612760,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"were scientific in any but the most cursory of ways"},{"startMs":3616760,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"so why we have that argument continually is somewhat beyond me"},{"startMs":3621100,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"part of the reason is, though, that everyone, fundamentalists included, really believe in scientific facts"},{"startMs":3629180,"durationMs":7160,"subtitle":"even though they hate it; they'll use conputers, they'll fly; computer's wouldn't work unless quantum mechanics were correct"},{"startMs":3636340,"durationMs":9220,"subtitle":"the fact that you use a high-tech device indicates through your action that you actually accept the theories upon which it's predicated"},{"startMs":3645560,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"right, the same as flying, same as anything you do in a complex technological society"},{"startMs":3650800,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"you're stuck with it; you're reading by the lights; do they work? yeah, they work"},{"startMs":3654780,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"well, so it's really hard for people who are trying to hold onto"},{"startMs":3659200,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"a way of looking at the world that appears to contradict the scientific claims"},{"startMs":3664980,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"when everything they do is predicated on their acceptance of the validity of the scientific claims"},{"startMs":3669720,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"it's really problematic for people"},{"startMs":3672300,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"it's problematic in a real way, I think, because"},{"startMs":3675520,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"one of the problems with the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't tell you anything about what you should do with your life"},{"startMs":3680460,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"it doesn't solve the problem of value at all"},{"startMs":3684660,"durationMs":2500,"subtitle":"in fact, it might make it more difficult, because"},{"startMs":3687160,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"one of the fundamental scientific claims, roughly speaking, is that every fact is of equal utility"},{"startMs":3693460,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"at least from a scientific perspective; there's no hierarchy of facts"},{"startMs":3698180,"durationMs":6740,"subtitle":"that's not exactly true, because you can think of one theory as \"more true\" than another"},{"startMs":3704920,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"but that boils down to saying that it's more useful than another"},{"startMs":3708240,"durationMs":2580,"subtitle":"so I don't think that that's a really good exception"},{"startMs":3710820,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"okay, so fine"},{"startMs":3713240,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"you got the scientific atheists on one end and you got the religious fundamentalists on the other"},{"startMs":3717720,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"and what they both agree on, whether they like it or not, is that"},{"startMs":3721600,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"there's so much power in the scientific method that it's difficult to dispute the validity of scientific facts"},{"startMs":3727000,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"and they seem to exist in contradiction to the older, archaic stories"},{"startMs":3732960,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"if you also accept them as fact-based accounts"},{"startMs":3737100,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"so what do we do about that? well, if you're on the scientific atheist end of things"},{"startMs":3741460,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"you say: well, those old stories are just superstitious science"},{"startMs":3745520,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"second-rate, barbaric, archaic forms of science; you just dispense with them, they're nothing but trouble"},{"startMs":3750860,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"and if you're on the fundamentalist side, you say: well we'll try to shoehorn science into this framework"},{"startMs":3756520,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and really that doesn't work very well; it doesn't work very well with the claims of evolution, for example"},{"startMs":3760720,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"in fact, it works very badly, and that's a problem, because evolutionary theory is like... it's a killer theory"},{"startMs":3767680,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"it's really, really hard..."},{"startMs":3771060,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"like it's not a complete theory, and there's lots of things we don't know about evolution, but... you know"},{"startMs":3777320,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"trying to handwave that away, that's not gonna work without dispensing with most of biology"},{"startMs":3785200,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"so that's a big problem; so here's another way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":3791700,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you don't just need one way of looking at the world"},{"startMs":3795300,"durationMs":6660,"subtitle":"maybe you need two ways of looking at the world, and I'm not exactly sure how they should be related to one another"},{"startMs":3801960,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"like which should take precedence under which circumstance"},{"startMs":3805000,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"but one problem is: what's the world made of?"},{"startMs":3809100,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"you know, what's the world, conceptualized as an objective place, made of"},{"startMs":3814160,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"and the other is: how should you conduct yourself while you're alive?"},{"startMs":3818280,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"and there's no reason to assume that those questions can be answered using the same approach"},{"startMs":3826120,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"I mean, physics has its methods, chemistry has its methods, and biology has its methods"},{"startMs":3833380,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"so a method for obtaining the truth can be bound to a domain"},{"startMs":3839140,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"so why would we necessarily assume that you could use the same set of tools"},{"startMs":3843820,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"to represent the world as a place of objects, and to represent as a place in which a biological creature would act?"},{"startMs":3850420,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"I mean, anyways, I'm suggesting that we..."},{"startMs":3855020,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"that we don't view it that way, that we have two different viewpoints"},{"startMs":3860000,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"maybe they can be brought together, although it's not obvious how"},{"startMs":3863600,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"but that it's not a tenable solution to get rid of one in favor of the other"},{"startMs":3869080,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"and I think the reason for that is that..."},{"startMs":3873580,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"you need to know how to conduct yourself in the world"},{"startMs":3876860,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"you have to have a value system, you can't even look at the damn world with out a value system"},{"startMs":3881960,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"it's not possible; your emotional health is dependent on a value system, the way you interact with other people is dependent on a value system"},{"startMs":3889460,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"there's no getting away from it"},{"startMs":3891880,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"and you say, well, there's no justification for any value system from a scientific perspective"},{"startMs":3896900,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"you're gonna draw that conclusion that no value system is valid, where the hell does that leave you?"},{"startMs":3901720,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"there's no down, there's no up, there's no rationale for moving in any direction"},{"startMs":3907100,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"there's not even really any rationale for living"},{"startMs":3909100,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"and so people say things like: well, why the hell should I care what happens, in a million years who's gonna know the difference?"},{"startMs":3914600,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"it's like, yeah, yeah, true. stupid, but true"},{"startMs":3919360,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and the reason I think it's stupid is because it's just a game, you know"},{"startMs":3923260,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"I can take anything of any sort and find a context in which it's irrelevant"},{"startMs":3927420,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"it's just a rational game, it's like"},{"startMs":3930600,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"who cares if a hundred children freeze to death in a blizzard? what difference is it gonna make in a billion years?"},{"startMs":3935680,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"well, what do you say to someone who says that? you say, well, seems like the wrong frame of reference, bucko"},{"startMs":3941720,"durationMs":7900,"subtitle":"that's what it looks like to me; you know, 'cause at some point you question the damn frame of reference, not what you derive from it"},{"startMs":3949620,"durationMs":8060,"subtitle":"and it certainly seems to me that situations like that don't allow you to use that kind of frame of reference, there's something inhumane about it"},{"startMs":3957680,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"and that trumps the logic, or at least it should"},{"startMs":3961140,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and if it doesn't, then all hell breaks loose, and that doesn't seem to be a good thing"},{"startMs":3965240,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"okay, so I have this quote from Shakespeare here"},{"startMs":3968940,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"he says: all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in time plays many parts"},{"startMs":3976860,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"well, it's the sort of thing that you'd expect a dramatist to pen, but that's how he looked at the world"},{"startMs":3982820,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"and we still watch Shakespeare's plays some hundreds of years later because there seems to be something essential captured in them"},{"startMs":3990100,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"something about how people do act, but more importantly, I think, how people should and shouldn't act"},{"startMs":3995760,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"because what fun is it going to a play that doesn't outline how someone should and shouldn't act?"},{"startMs":4002580,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"you want a good guy or a couple of them, maybe they can be complex interminglings of good and bad"},{"startMs":4008060,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"you know, that makes it more sophisticated"},{"startMs":4010060,"durationMs":9300,"subtitle":"and you want a bad guy or a bad... you always want to see that contract either within a character or between characters"},{"startMs":4019360,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and it's because you want to know how to live properly, that's how to be a good person"},{"startMs":4023620,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and you wanna know how to live improperly, how to be a bad person, so you can watch out for people like that"},{"startMs":4028400,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"or so you can figure out what that means for yourself; it's compelling"},{"startMs":4034300,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"and that's another thing that's worth thinking about:"},{"startMs":4039720,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"why is it compelling?"},{"startMs":4042120,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"and it's compelling to everyone, and that's the thing that's so cool, is that there aren't that many phenomena that you can point to that are compelling to everyone"},{"startMs":4049060,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"music is close, it's a very rare person who doesn't like at least some genre of music, no matter how narrow"},{"startMs":4056180,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"but the other one is stories, you're hard pressed to find someone, especially if they're younger, who doesn't like stories"},{"startMs":4063420,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"why? is it a waste of time? or is there something going on?"},{"startMs":4068620,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"well..."},{"startMs":4070620,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"i think it's not only not a waste of time, it's actually the most fundamentally important thing you can possibly do"},{"startMs":4077080,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"because there's no difference between understanding stories and figuring out how to get along in the world"},{"startMs":4083100,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"so, and there's a tight relationship between the story that you inhabit, that structures your behavior"},{"startMs":4090780,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"and the games that Piaget talked about, that organize people's behavior,"},{"startMs":4094840,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"to some degree the reason we can all sit in this room together like this"},{"startMs":4100340,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"is because a huge chunk of the value system that guides our behavior is shared"},{"startMs":4106780,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"so I'm lecturing and you're sitting in the classroom, and that distinguishes us to some degree"},{"startMs":4113200,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"but you know that that's partly merely a consequence of the difference in our age"},{"startMs":4117140,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"it's the same trajectory, we just happen to occupy different positions in a value hierarchy that we both accept"},{"startMs":4123160,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"and so, as long as you feel that that's fair and just, then you're not gonna object to it, but"},{"startMs":4128220,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"I'm here in the classroom for many of the same reasons that you're here in the classroom"},{"startMs":4131960,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"if you look at the higher-order parts of the value structure, and maybe right at the end of that..."},{"startMs":4136680,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"'cause I've tried to figure out if you push why you're doing what you're doing right now to its ultimate limit"},{"startMs":4143700,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"so you can't get a story that's superordinate to that"},{"startMs":4147080,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"it's something like, well, you belive that the investigation of the world to acquire knowledge is worthwhile"},{"startMs":4153060,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"otherwise what the hell are you here for?"},{"startMs":4155340,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and even if 80% of your motivation is to get a good, stable job, fair enough"},{"startMs":4160980,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"there's still something outside of that"},{"startMs":4162980,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"because the whole culture says, well, you're more likely to be able to function properly in a good, stable job"},{"startMs":4168120,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"if you're the sort of person who knows how to go out in the world and forage for information usefully"},{"startMs":4173320,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"and I think that's very much analogous to the hero story"},{"startMs":4176480,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"it's like, you go out and you search the unknown to find something of value"},{"startMs":4181380,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"and so fundamentally that's what we're doing in the classroom"},{"startMs":4183980,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"and the reason we can all organize our behavior is because we accept that framework consciously..."},{"startMs":4189960,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"consciously would be: we know how to articulate it"},{"startMs":4193160,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"unconsciously it's: well, it doesn't matter, we know how to act out the patterns"},{"startMs":4197360,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"whether we can say the rules or not, doesn't matter"},{"startMs":4200920,"durationMs":10080,"subtitle":"same as a wolf pack; we know the procedures, and you could describe them with an articulated value structure"},{"startMs":4213900,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"let's take a break"},{"startMs":4215900,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"okay, so let's go back to the complexity problem"},{"startMs":4219600,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"you see, I actually think in some sense that's the fundamental problem"},{"startMs":4225220,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"when you read about the terror management theorist types"},{"startMs":4230060,"durationMs":3080,"subtitle":"they think that death is the fundamental problem"},{"startMs":4233140,"durationMs":7160,"subtitle":"and that's a good argument, because it's definitely a fundamental problem, but I think it's a subset of the complexity problem"},{"startMs":4240300,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"and the reason I think that is because sometimes people's lives become so complex that they'd rather be dead"},{"startMs":4247420,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and the reason they seek death through suicide is to make the complexity go away"},{"startMs":4253600,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"'cause complexity causes suffering if it's uncontrolled"},{"startMs":4257040,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"you know, things just get beyond your control"},{"startMs":4259780,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"and that can happen, you know, if you're hit by three or four catastrophes at the same time"},{"startMs":4264360,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"you know, maybe you have... oh, the political system collapses, there's hyperinflation"},{"startMs":4270240,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"you lose your job, and you have someone that you love or two people die, and maybe you get cancer, something like that"},{"startMs":4276820,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"those things happen to people, and they just think, well, there's no getting out of this, it's just too much"},{"startMs":4283240,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"and you know, one of the interesting things about being a psychologist is that"},{"startMs":4287780,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"what you learn if you're gonna be a psychologist is that people come to you with mental illnesses - and that's almost never true"},{"startMs":4294680,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"people come to you, because their lives are so damn complicated, they cannot stay on top of them"},{"startMs":4298980,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"in any way that doesn't make it look like they're just gonna get more complicated"},{"startMs":4303180,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and so then that causes symptoms, you know it's like..."},{"startMs":4306380,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"there's this old idea, a sort of a metaphor for genetic susceptibility"},{"startMs":4311080,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"take a balloon and blow it up until it's beyond its tolerance - it's going to blow out at the weakest point"},{"startMs":4316000,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"well that's sort of what a genetic susceptibility is"},{"startMs":4318380,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"if I just keep adding complexity on top of you, at some point you'll blow out at your weakest point"},{"startMs":4323900,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"you know, maybe you'll get physiologically ill, maybe you'll start drinking"},{"startMs":4327220,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"maybe you'll develop an anxiety disorder, maybe you'll get OCD, maybe you'll get depressed"},{"startMs":4331040,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"whatever, they'll be something about you that's the weakest point"},{"startMs":4334380,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"and if I just push, that's where you'll blow out, so"},{"startMs":4337260,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"that's a mental illness, but those things almost never just happen"},{"startMs":4341140,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"sometimes, but not very often, usually people have just been hammered like two or three different ways"},{"startMs":4346220,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"and then they collapse in the direction of their biological weakness, and"},{"startMs":4351120,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"then maybe you put them back together, but"},{"startMs":4353280,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"it's almost always a complexity-related phenomenon rather than a mental illness-related phenomenon"},{"startMs":4358300,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"not always, but almost always"},{"startMs":4360540,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"okay, so now"},{"startMs":4362980,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"you got this complexity problem, and you think: well, you deal with it conceptually"},{"startMs":4367940,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and that's sort of akin to the idea that it's belief systems that protect you from death anxiety"},{"startMs":4374940,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"the ideas are roughly comparable, but again, that's wrong"},{"startMs":4379300,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"it's the sort of thing only a psychologist could think up"},{"startMs":4382080,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"because psychologists think that everything about you happens inside your head, so to speak, in your psyche, but that's not true"},{"startMs":4387520,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"there's a huge chunk of you that's outside of you completely"},{"startMs":4391040,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"and so, this is a really good example, like, we know the oldest cities, this is a medieval city in France"},{"startMs":4396760,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"a beautiful old city"},{"startMs":4399360,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"old cities were walled, and the reason for that was because"},{"startMs":4404080,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"they were places of wealth, and if you didn't put walls around them then"},{"startMs":4408280,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"other people would come in and steal everything and kill you"},{"startMs":4411580,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"so having some walls was a good idea"},{"startMs":4414560,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"the same as having walls in your house is a good idea"},{"startMs":4417900,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"walls between your rooms are a good idea, or borders between categories are a good idea"},{"startMs":4423280,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"and so, part of the way you simplify the world is by building walls around your space, because then a whole bunch of things can't come in"},{"startMs":4430640,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"and so, you don't even have to think about them; it's not conceptual, it's practical"},{"startMs":4434980,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"and so, and you know, one of the things I think I've figured out recently"},{"startMs":4439440,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"is the fundamental political difference between people"},{"startMs":4442820,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"and it looks to me like the fundamental political difference, is:"},{"startMs":4446480,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"how many walls should there be around your stuff?"},{"startMs":4449800,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"and the ultimate liberal answer is: zero"},{"startMs":4453100,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and the ultimate conservative answer is: bring on those walls, man!"},{"startMs":4457660,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"and what's interesting about both those perspectives"},{"startMs":4460760,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"first of all is that there's temperamental contributions to them, and second that they're both valid"},{"startMs":4465320,"durationMs":8620,"subtitle":"so one of the mysteries, I believe, that permeates psychometric psychology right now is"},{"startMs":4473940,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"why the temperamental factors that influence politics are those particular temperamental factors"},{"startMs":4480300,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"so there's five, let's say, right, there's classic Big 5: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness"},{"startMs":4486300,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"well, the biggest predictors of political allegiance, forget about the politically correct types for a minute"},{"startMs":4492240,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"but on the liberal to conservative axis is that the liberals are low in conscientiousness and high in openness"},{"startMs":4498080,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"and the conservatives are high in conscientiousness and low in openness"},{"startMs":4501220,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and so then you think, well, why those two traits? that's the first question"},{"startMs":4504980,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"and the second question is: why those two traits together?"},{"startMs":4508160,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"given that they're not very highly correlated, right, they're really quite independent"},{"startMs":4512180,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"so why do they co-vary on the political axis?"},{"startMs":4515100,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"and I think this is the reason, I think

you say, well, motivation determines where you're gonna aim, so if you're hungry, you're gonna aim at something to eat"},{"startMs":7039620,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"and then that will organize your perceptions, so that you zero out everything that isn't relevant to that task"},{"startMs":7045920,"durationMs":1500,"subtitle":"which is almost

way"},{"startMs":7072240,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"it can be anger, so that you move it away, it can be frustration, disappointment, grief, those would..."},{"startMs":7077700,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"if you have a response that serious to an obstacle, it would probably punish the little motivated frame right out of existence"},{"startMs":7084660,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"so you walk downstairs and I don't know, the contracting company sent a wrecking ball through your kitchen"},{"startMs":7090960,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"that's gonna be disappointing"},{"startMs":7093280,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"you're not gonna keep eating your peanut butter sandwich in the rubble"},{"startMs":7096080,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"that little frame is going to get punished out of existence"},{"startMs":7098980,"durationMs":2700,"subtitle":"and some new goal is gonna pop up in its stead"},{"startMs":7101680,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and one of the things we're gonna try to sort out is how do you decide"},{"startMs":7105940,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"when you've encountered an obstacle that's so big that you should just quit and go do something else"},{"startMs":7110520,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"'cause that's not obvious"},{"startMs":7113480,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"you can get into counterproductive persistence pretty easily"},{"startMs":7117680,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"we don't know how people solve that problem, it's a really complicated one"},{"startMs":7121240,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"so anyways, we're gonna work on that scenario"},{"startMs":7123500,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"your hypothalamus pops up micro-goals that are directly relevant to biological survival"},{"startMs":7129900,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"that produces a frame of reference"},{"startMs":7132140,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"so it's not a goal, and it's not a drive, and it's not a collection of behaviors, it's a little personality"},{"startMs":7138380,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and the little personality has a viewpoint, it has thoughts that go along with it"},{"startMs":7142400,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"it has perceptions, it has action tendencies, all of that"},{"startMs":7146260,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"you can see this in addiction, most particularly"},{"startMs":7150100,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"so one of the things that you find often with people who are alcoholic is they lie all the time"},{"startMs":7155460,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"and that's because when they built a little alcohol-dependent personality inside of themselves"},{"startMs":7161600,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"or a big one, maybe it's 90% of their personality"},{"startMs":7165220,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and one of the things that consists of"},{"startMs":7169240,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"is all the rationalizations that they've used over the years to justify their addiction to themselves and to other people"},{"startMs":7175760,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and so the addiction has a personality"},{"startMs":7179120,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"and so when the person is off..."},{"startMs":7181020,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"maybe they're addicted to meth or something like that, where we know the addiction is more..."},{"startMs":7186440,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"it's more short-term powerful than, I would say, an alcohol addiction"},{"startMs":7190520,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"they'll say anything, and the words are just tools to get towards the goal"},{"startMs":7196580,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and if they happen to be deceptive, whatever, it doesn't matter, they're just practical tools to get towards the goal"},{"startMs":7201960,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and then when you get towards a goal, you take a nice shot of meth or something like that"},{"startMs":7205980,"durationMs":7100,"subtitle":"you reinforce all those rationales that you used to get the drug, and the next time you're even a better deceiver and liar"},{"startMs":7213080,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"so we're gonna say, motivations, one way of thinking about it is they set goals, but it's not the right way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":7219320,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"they produce a whole framework of interpretation, and so we're gonna think about that framework of interpretation"},{"startMs":7224880,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"and then emotions emerge inside of that"},{"startMs":7227860,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"so the world is framed, motivation set goals, you could say the world has to be framed"},{"startMs":7233240,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"so motivation sets that frame: goals, emotions, perceptions and actions"},{"startMs":7237640,"durationMs":2260,"subtitle":"and then the actions (he means emotions) track progress, so"},{"startMs":7239900,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"positive emotion says: you're moving forward properly towards your goal"},{"startMs":7244540,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and if you encounter something you don't expect, you stop, that's anxiety"},{"startMs":7248440,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"it's like: oh! we're not where we thought we were"},{"startMs":7250780,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"and so we don't know what to do, so we should stop, 'cause we don't know where we are and what we're doing; stop, frozen"},{"startMs":7256880,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"and then the more powerful negative emotions like pain, they might make you get out of theres, so..."},{"startMs":7263720,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"emotions: forward, stop, reverse; that's your emotions within that motivated frame"},{"startMs":7269820,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"and that's another example of how your mind is embedded in your body"},{"startMs":7274500,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"emotions are offshoots of action tendencies, that's the right way to think about it"},{"startMs":7280340,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"'cause action is everything, fundamentally"},{"startMs":7283980,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"so what are some basic motivations?"},{"startMs":7286180,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"most of these are regulated by the hypothalamus, by the way, and that tells you just how important a control system it is"},{"startMs":7291820,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"the other that's useful to know about the hypothalamus is that it has projections going up from it that are like tree trunks"},{"startMs":7297460,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"and inhibitory projections coming down that are like grape vines"},{"startMs":7302660,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"so you can kinda control your hypothalamus as long as it's not on too much, but"},{"startMs":7306760,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"if it's on in any serious way, its like... it wins"},{"startMs":7311560,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"so partly what you do to stop yourself from falling under the dominion of your hypothalamus"},{"startMs":7317220,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"is to never, ever be anywhere where its action is necessary"},{"startMs":7321380,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"right? you don't wanna go into a biker bar"},{"startMs":7324040,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"because you might find yourself in a situation where panicked defensive aggression is immediately necessary"},{"startMs":7330200,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"you probably don't want that; you don't want the panic, you don't want the terror"},{"startMs":7334240,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"you don't want the frenzied fight, you don't want any of that, you don't wanna have to run away in absolute panic"},{"startMs":7339420,"durationMs":1880,"subtitle":"so you just don't go there"},{"startMs":7341300,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"and a huge part of how we regulate our emotions"},{"startMs":7345760,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"is just by never going anywhere where we have to experience them"},{"startMs":7349300,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"and so that has very little to do with internal inhibitory control, and everything to do with staying where you belong"},{"startMs":7355940,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"so... okay"},{"startMs":7358800,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"so, basic motivations: hunger, thirst, pain"},{"startMs":7361920,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"pain is not regulated by the hypothalamus, that's a different circuit"},{"startMs":7365020,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"anger / aggression, thermoregulation"},{"startMs":7368200,"durationMs":1900,"subtitle":"panic and escape"},{"startMs":7370100,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"affiliation and care, sexual desire, exploration, play"},{"startMs":7373900,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and you can kinda break those into"},{"startMs":7378860,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"the classic darwinian categories, too, and say, well, there's a set of motivations that go along with self-maintenance"},{"startMs":7384720,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"that's be your survival, ingestive and defensive"},{"startMs":7388040,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"see, I've sort of coded them there"},{"startMs":7391700,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"so the self maintenance"},{"startMs":7395480,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"there's an ingestive set of basic motivations that go with self maintenance, that's hunger, thirst"},{"startMs":7400620,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"there's a set of defensive motivations: pain, anger, thermoregulation, panic and escape"},{"startMs":7406420,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and then there's motivations that are associated with reproduction"},{"startMs":7410180,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"affiliation, care, and sexual desire"},{"startMs":7413560,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"and then I put exploration and play sort of outside of that"},{"startMs":7417920,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"I would say because those two things serve both of these approximately equally"},{"startMs":7423400,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"so what I tried to do is take the basic motivations, and then nest them inside a fundamental darwinian framework"},{"startMs":7429300,"durationMs":11680,"subtitle":"so that you can see how the biological process of evolution has manifested itself, an then sort of differentiated into these fundamental biological systems"},{"startMs":7440980,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"okay, so this is a rat brain flat map"},{"startMs":7444940,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"so it's basically what you would see of a rat's brain if you flattened it out, unrolled it, flattened it out, and then made it two-dimesional"},{"startMs":7452160,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and you can see here..."},{"startMs":7454160,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"so this is the hypothalamus"},{"startMs":7458100,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and you can see that it's made out of these different nuclei, that's what they're called"},{"startMs":7462180,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"and they sort of correspond to those shapes that I showed you in the human hypothalamus earlier"},{"startMs":7466140,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"and you see that there's different systems, there's the system for eating and drinking, it's outlined in green"},{"startMs":7471620,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"and the reproductive system, there's two of them, and they're outlined in I think it's red... is that right?"},{"startMs":7479580,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"yeah, reproductive is red, and the defensive ones are in magenta"},{"startMs":7484880,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and so those are the... you could think about those as the three fundamental value systems"},{"startMs":7489660,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"of living creatures with complex nervous systems as far as the hypothalamus is concerned"},{"startMs":7494860,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and then, given what I told you about the hypothalamus, which is..."},{"startMs":7499660,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"you hardly need the rest of your brain at all, as long as you have a hypothalamus"},{"startMs":7504460,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"it's worth thinking that those are very fundamental to value per se"},{"startMs":7508720,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"now, you might think, if you only need the damn hypothalamus, why bother with the rest of the brain at all?"},{"startMs":7514920,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"which is a very useful question"},{"startMs":7517380,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"especially because most creatures don't have much of a brain, so..."},{"startMs":7521060,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"but it seems to be something like:"},{"startMs":7523700,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"well, you've got your eating and drinking system, your reproductive system, and your defensive system, but"},{"startMs":7528400,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"the problem is that those things, first of all, can conflict,"},{"startMs":7532880,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"you know, are you too hungry to sleep or too sleepy to eat?"},{"startMs":7536540,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"that's a pretty simple kind of contradiction"},{"startMs":7539400,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"are you more angry at your partner or do you want sexual relations more?"},{"startMs":7543340,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"so they can conflict in the present"},{"startMs":7546820,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"but then they can conflict with other people doing the same thing"},{"startMs":7550480,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"and they can conflict across time"},{"startMs":7552800,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"and so partly the reason that you need the rest of your brain is to solve the problems from the solutions that the hypothalamus offers"},{"startMs":7560200,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"and so, because you don't wanna just eat and drink, and reproduce and defend yourself"},{"startMs":7566340,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"you wanna eat now, later, tomorrow, next week, and next month"},{"startMs":7571440,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"while you're able to engage in reproductive activity and defend yourself"},{"startMs":7576220,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"in multiple contexts, with a whole bunch of people, for as long as you can possibly manage it"},{"startMs":7580840,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"and so you need the rest of your brain to calculate that"},{"startMs":7583520,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"and so what the rest of your brain has to do, roughly speaking, is regulate these"},{"startMs":7589560,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and also elaborate them up into... into something that's integrated inside you"},{"startMs":7595140,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"which might roughly be your personality, and then"},{"startMs":7597660,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"so that that personality is integrated with the personality of other people"},{"startMs":7601440,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"and so you can think about it as an emergent process"},{"startMs":7603800,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"this is one of the things I really like about Piaget"},{"startMs":7606220,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"he's so damn smart, because Piaget is the only thinker I know, really"},{"startMs":7611320,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"who really addressed the problem of the evolution of value systems"},{"startMs":7615480,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"like, he never nailed it down to the physiology, because there wasn't enough known about physiology when he did his work"},{"startMs":7621480,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"but it maps really nicely onto the physiology"},{"startMs":7623920,"durationMs":2180,"subtitle":"..."},{"startMs":7626100,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"but he got it right anyways, he said: you come into the world with a handful of preestablished reflexes"},{"startMs":7633360,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"okay, we're gonna complicate that up a bit: no, you come into the world with a handful of micropersonalities"},{"startMs":7639400,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"that are centered around these fundamental motivational axes, okay"},{"startMs":7644100,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"and then that gets you started"},{"startMs":7646840,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and that has motor output as well as perceptions, and all of that, that's associated with it"},{"startMs":7651400,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"and then, as you interact initially, let's say, with your mother"},{"startMs":7655660,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"you start to learn how to integrate those things in some sort of social context"},{"startMs":7659340,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"because you form a relationship with your mother right off the bat"},{"startMs":7663200,"durationMs":9080,"subtitle":"and so, you're starting to figure out how to produce patterned and stable interactions between those motivational systems"},{"startMs":7672280,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"on a day to day, week to week, month to month basis"},{"startMs":7675040,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and one of the things you do with kids, it's really important to do this with kids"},{"startMs":7678940,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"you wanna get them on to some sort of a routine"},{"startMs":7682200,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"'cause what the routine is actually, is the beginnings of the system that integrates"},{"startMs":7686960,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"all of these underlying biological systems into some sort of unity"},{"startMs":7690460,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"'cause they have to sleep and wake up, so you wanna get that nailed down, so it's predictable"},{"startMs":7696640,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"you know, they have to eat, they have to stay warm"},{"startMs":7699080,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and they need to do that in a manner that's stable"},{"startMs":7703240,"durationMs":8780,"subtitle":"and so, it's to your great benefit as a parent that you get islands of stability planted in the life of your kid"},{"startMs":7712020,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"so that some of this gets simplified, so that the kid isn't constantly preoccupied with domination by these different motivational systems"},{"startMs":7719900,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"and so it's a useful thing to know, because you might think, well, you don't wanna impose any structure on your baby, it's like, no, wrong"},{"startMs":7726280,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"you don't wanna be a tyrant about it, but"},{"startMs":7729600,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"there's no difference between that structure, and the emergence of the child's adaptation to the world"},{"startMs":7735160,"durationMs":7100,"subtitle":"and to some degree what you're trying to do is free them up from arbitrary domination by these underlying motivational systems"},{"startMs":7742260,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"you know, 'cause if the baby gets too tired, it's a horrible little thing, it'll just scream at you non stop"},{"startMs":7748740,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"and it's not happy about it, it's like it's not good for anyone for that to happen"},{"startMs":7753060,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"and so the faster... you have to do it in relationship with the child"},{"startMs":7756760,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"some will sleep right away in a schedule almost immediately"},{"startMs":7760800,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"and other kids are harder to get their circadian rhythms regulated"},{"startMs":7766860,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"so you have to attend to the individual differences that characterize the child, but"},{"startMs":7770700,"durationMs":10620,"subtitle":"you're still trying to establish some stable harmony out of this mish-mash of initial systems"},{"startMs":7781320,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"alright, so that's sort of a physiological look, and this is a more of a conceptual look at it"},{"startMs":7788840,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"I said that each of these systems you can think about in a bunch of different ways"},{"startMs":7792860,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"you can think about it as something that sets a goal"},{"startMs":7796480,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"\"I'm hungry, and I don't wanna be hungry - point A, point B"},{"startMs":7801120,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"so the hunger and the vision of the satiation of the hunger are all part of the same frame"},{"startMs":7807400,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and so, if you're hungry, you go into the kitchen"},{"startMs":7810920,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"you know that already, that's part of your procedural knowledge about how the world works"},{"startMs":7817720,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"and then what you're gonna look for are only those things that are relevant to what you're trying to do in the kitchen"},{"startMs":7823320,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"everything else is zeroed out, you won't even really see it, and why would you?"},{"startMs":7827040,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you want to see the things that are relevant to the task at hand"},{"startMs":7831000,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and so that's the thing that's so cool, I think"},{"startMs":7834720,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"because what it means is that you see the things that are relevant to the task at hand"},{"startMs":7838920,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and so, here's something to think about"},{"startMs":7840920,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"let's say that you see a whole bunch of things that you don't wanna see"},{"startMs":7844780,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"that make you constantly miserable and unhappy"},{"startMs":7847600,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"one thing that you might ask yourself is: are you sure that your goals are proper?"},{"startMs":7853000,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"because your goals determine what you see; now, not a 100 percent, obviously"},{"startMs":7857400,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"you could be thinking about the homework you're gonna do and step off a curb and be hit by a van, it's like"},{"startMs":7863560,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"you're gonna get hit by the van regardless of how you've oriented your perceptions, in all likelihood"},{"startMs":7869140,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"so I'm not trying to argue for pure solipsism"},{"startMs":7871980,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"but it is very interesting to consider that since you see in relationship to what you want"},{"startMs":7878280,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"that a very large amount of what you see is dependent on what you're aiming at"},{"startMs":7882820,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"and so one issue is: if your life is wretched and miserable"},{"startMs":7886480,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"one thing to think about is whether or not what you're aiming at is the right thing to be aiming at"},{"startMs":7890580,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"and \"nothing\" is exactly the wrong answer to that"},{"startMs":7894560,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"\"I'm aiming at nothing\" Okay, you're gonna experience a tremendous amount of misery and not very much joy"},{"startMs":7900540,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"so anyways, you've got this little frame:"},{"startMs":7903500,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"you're somewhere, and it's not good enough, and you're going somewhere else, that's going to be better"},{"startMs":7908700,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and what \"better\" depends upon is the state of these underlying biological systems"},{"startMs":7915660,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"and then, more complexly, as those biological systems get integrated into a personality, and into the social world"},{"startMs":7921820,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"then the frame and the goal is going to be dependent on that more complex hierarchical organization"},{"startMs":7928580,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"so, you're not in here 'cause you're hungry"},{"startMs":7930900,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"you're in here, because if you get a degree, maybe you don't ever have to be hungry"},{"startMs":7935060,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"so the hunger is properly incorporated into your..."},{"startMs":7940280,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"you don't wanna be cold, you don't wanna freeze to death in the winter, you don't wanna be on the street"},{"startMs":7943660,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"you know, so your higher-order goals are"},{"startMs":7946540,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"long-term socially negotiated solutions"},{"startMs":7950820,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"to the problems that are implicit in your being, that might be one way of thinkig about it"},{"startMs":7957680,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"and the microelements of this... so you could say \"I'm hungry\", that's a physiological state and a conception"},{"startMs":7964480,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"\"I have a vision about how I'm going to solve that\""},{"startMs":7967140,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"but then... and that's an abstraction"},{"startMs":7971000,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"but what you do to transform point A into point B is not an abstraction, you act"},{"startMs":7976900,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"you know, so if you're hungry, you actually move your body, say down from the second floor into the kitchen"},{"startMs":7982820,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"and you arrange things so that there's transformations in the world"},{"startMs":7987340,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"that's a good way of thinking about the relationship between the mind and the body"},{"startMs":7991100,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"your hypothetical solution to your problem, that's the mind"},{"startMs":7995620,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"but the manner in which you incarnate that solution"},{"startMs":7998780,"durationMs":2420,"subtitle":"that's no longer abstract"},{"startMs":8001200,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"you know, people are always trying to solve the mind-body problem"},{"startMs":8004420,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"and as far as I can tell, that's how you solve it, is: you have abstractions, but they're not abstractions that are representations of the world"},{"startMs":8011220,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"they're abstractions that are representations of action patterns"},{"startMs":8016180,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"and the way those are implemented in the world is that you act them"},{"startMs":8020540,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"and so, it's strange, 'cause you've got this weird level of control"},{"startMs":8024340,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"I can move my arm, and I seem to be able to do that voluntarily"},{"startMs":8027500,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"but Ireally have no idea how I'm doing it"},{"startMs":8029840,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"like I don't have conscious access exactly to the musculature, except technically"},{"startMs":8035980,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"and I certainly have no idea what I'm doing chemically to make those muscles transform"},{"startMs":8041280,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"so my abstractions ground out in this movement"},{"startMs":8047540,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"and I can observe the movement, and modify it, but"},{"startMs":8052800,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"I have no conscious access whatsoever to the micro processes that are making tha possible"},{"startMs":8057480,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"I've no idea why that is, probably because I'm not smart enough"},{"startMs":8061200,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"that would be my guess"},{"startMs":8063200,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"evolution is only going to allow your mind to control those elements of your being"},{"startMs":8069820,"durationMs":1740,"subtitle":"that you're smart enough to control"},{"startMs":8071560,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"and so you don't get voluntary control over your heartbeat, for example, because you'd just forget"},{"startMs":8075500,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"and then you'd be wandering around, and then you'd forget to beat your heart, bang, you'd be dead, so you don't get to do that"},{"startMs":8082540,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"..."},{"startMs":8086260,"durationMs":1780,"subtitle":"all these different..."},{"startMs":8088040,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"I classify these, again, as self-propagation and self-maintenance motivations"},{"startMs":8094020,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"if you're too hot, well, you wanna go somewhere cooler, and if you're too cool you wanna go somewhere hotter"},{"startMs":8098580,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"same if you're thirsty and hungry"},{"startMs":8100580,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"and for self-propagation, well, you get lonesome and maybe you have some sexual desire"},{"startMs":8105880,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"and each of those different systems competes for access to this central frame"},{"startMs":8111280,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"and that's something like the contents of your consciousness at any given time"},{"startMs":8115420,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"so up pops a desire... but it's a wrong way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":8120920,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"'cause a desire sounds like something that's pushing you forward"},{"startMs":8123780,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"but the desire is goal, framework, emotion, perception, action pattern, all at the same time"},{"startMs":8129380,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"it's a little personality, or it's a little story"},{"startMs":8132160,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"actually, when you describe the operation of one of these things, that's when you're teling a story"},{"startMs":8137560,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"so I was somewhere, I needed something, I went and got it"},{"startMs":8142160,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"it's a boring little story, but that's the basic unit of a story"},{"startMs":8146900,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"'cause I don't care to hear what you're doing unless you had a reason for doing it"},{"startMs":8150560,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"I just say: what's the point of the story?"},{"startMs":8153800,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"and the point of the story is the point"},{"startMs":8156480,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"it's directional, right?"},{"startMs":8158480,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"it says: \"I went from here to there\", that's the point, \"here's how I did it\", that's the point"},{"startMs":8163220,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"and you're interested in that, because maybe you want to know how to do it too"},{"startMs":8166200,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"and you won't have to struggle through it like I did, you could just listen"},{"startMs":8169360,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and so we're always throwing these little units of information back and forth to each other"},{"startMs":8173440,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and for good reason; I wanna know what your point is"},{"startMs":8177280,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"because better Iearn it from you than make all the mistakes that you had to make when you were learning it"},{"startMs":8182220,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and human beings, we've got that figured out, that's for sure"},{"startMs":8187400,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"okay, I'm gonna just explain this"},{"startMs":8191900,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"and then we'll stop; alright, so"},{"startMs":8195500,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"we're in one of those frames now, and we're going from point A to point B"},{"startMs":8200600,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and so, the question is: how does the world lay itself out?"},{"startMs":8204040,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"okay, so the first thing to understand, and this is partly the reason I showed you the gorilla video, is that"},{"startMs":8209520,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"the first thing a frame does for you is make almost everything irrelevant"},{"startMs":8213160,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"and that's so great, because that's what you want"},{"startMs":8215440,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"you want almost everything to be irrelevant, because otherwise you're gonna be so flooded with information, that you..."},{"startMs":8221380,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"that's what hallucinogens do, at least in their initial stages"},{"startMs":8225620,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"is they take away that filter, and make everything relevant"},{"startMs":8229300,"durationMs":4220,"subtitle":"you can read about that in Huxley's \"Doors of Perception\""},{"startMs":8233520,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"he does a great job of describing the initial stages of a mescaline experience"},{"startMs":8237420,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"and what happens is that all of the memory, in some sense, that regulates his perceptions is stripped off"},{"startMs":8243960,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"and so he sees everything glowing, and alive, and magical like he'd never encountered it before"},{"startMs":8249740,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"which is exactly how you would see something if all your memory about it was gone"},{"startMs":8253620,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and so he sees things as way more complex and interesting than he normally sees them"},{"startMs":8258000,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"well, that's fine, but, you know, if you're like that all the time, then, you know, you end up in a ditch, starving to death or something"},{"startMs":8263360,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"it's not commensurate with normal life, that's what it looks like"},{"startMs":8267420,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"and so your perceptions are just shrunken, restricted to the bare minimum necessary to keep you moving in the direction that you're moving"},{"startMs":8274780,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"alright, so the first thing you wanna do is you wanna make things irrelevant"},{"startMs":8279100,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"now, if you're with someone"},{"startMs":8282360,"durationMs":2180,"subtitle":"in a relationship"},{"startMs":8284540,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"partly what you want them to do is to help you continue making most of their possibility irrelevant"},{"startMs":8291560,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"it's polite"},{"startMs":8293560,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"so you say, well, \"we have a friendship\", let's say"},{"startMs":8298580,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"so that means you've agreed to act in a friendly manner towards me, and to support me"},{"startMs":8303380,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"there's all sorts of other ways you could act"},{"startMs":8305620,"durationMs":1740,"subtitle":"like a myriad of them"},{"startMs":8307360,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and I' gonna do the same for you, so we're simpler to each other than we would normally be"},{"startMs":8312100,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and then you go and so something that betrays me, it's like bang, that whole simplification is gone"},{"startMs":8317860,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and all those parts of you that were supposed to be irrelevant, 'cause we were playing the same game"},{"startMs":8322640,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"they're dead relevant, and I don't know who the hell you are"},{"startMs":8325540,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"and so that's really rough, and people do not like that"},{"startMs":8328340,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"it's this emergent mismatch between their desires and the way the world is manifesting itself"},{"startMs":8333500,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"so one of the issues of complexity is that"},{"startMs":8337020,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"when you hit an obstacle, everything that you have agreed with other people to make irrelevant - is relevant"},{"startMs":8345420,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"and that's generally a disconcerting experience"},{"startMs":8349120,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"now you can, you know, you might wanna toy a little bit with that in a relationship"},{"startMs":8355520,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"maybe you encourage your partner to dress differently or you go do different things or something"},{"startMs":8359500,"durationMs":3100,"subtitle":"'cause you don't wanna be stuck in exactly the same old rut"},{"startMs":8362600,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"and so what you'll agree is how you can both deviate an interesting amount"},{"startMs":8367440,"durationMs":8140,"subtitle":"but that's voluntary and controlled, it's not the same at all as having that little mess of eighty million snakes pop up right in front of you"},{"startMs":8375580,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"which is the last thing you wanna have happen, and so"},{"startMs":8379320,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"it's so weird, because one of the things that we're striving to do constatnly is to keep most of the world irrelevant"},{"startMs":8385860,"durationMs":7460,"subtitle":"and our cultural systems are designed precisely for that purpose, and par of what you do when you disrupt them is"},{"startMs":8393320,"durationMs":8540,"subtitle":"you force people to consider a far more range of relevance than they are even vaguely comfortable or vaguely comfortable to manage"},{"startMs":8401860,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and it just burns them to a crisp"},{"startMs":8403860,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"because what your body does is:"},{"startMs":8405860,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"if all of a sudden everything around you is relevant..."},{"startMs":8408240,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"like I could say: \"you're stripped naked, I take you in a helicopter, drop you right into the middle of the jungle at midnight\""},{"startMs":8414500,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"it's like, you're not bored"},{"startMs":8417340,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"standing there, frozen, paralyzed, everything is interesting"},{"startMs":8422580,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"well, too bad for you, 'cause too interesting is very little different from terrifying, and so"},{"startMs":8429000,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"you know, your heart rate's gonna be at 160 for like two days, and then something will eat you, and your problems will be over"},{"startMs":8435160,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"alright, so this diagram basically suggests this"},{"startMs":8439080,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"is this is how you break up the world when you're going from point A to point B"},{"startMs":8442760,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"it renders almost everything irelevant, hooray"},{"startMs":8447180,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"and then what happens is the rest of the world is broken up into obstacles that get in your way"},{"startMs":8452840,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"and tools that facilitate your movement forward"},{"startMs":8455860,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"and that's actually what you see when you come into a place"},{"startMs":8458620,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"like when you come into this room, these are obstacles insofar as you con't walk through them"},{"startMs":8463440,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"and those are tools insofar as you can sit on them and watch the class"},{"startMs":8467020,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and this is a tool, and these are tools, and this is a tool"},{"startMs":8472380,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"and I'm a tool, although I'd never admit it"},{"startMs":8474580,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"but anyways, I'm a tool, because you need to take this class in order to advance towards your degree"},{"startMs":8483460,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and so, basically what you see inthe world are entities of functional significance"},{"startMs":8488260,"durationMs":3020,"subtitle":"and those are not objects, they're not the same thing"},{"startMs":8491280,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and that's very much worth considering, because we're trying to"},{"startMs":8495920,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"build up a case, at least in part, for analyzing the nature of the structure within which you organize your perceptions"},{"startMs":8503920,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"and we tend to think that those are predicated on object perception"},{"startMs":8507600,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"it's not true"},{"startMs":8509600,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"it's not true, they're predicated on relevance conception"},{"startMs":8513980,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"does it help you? does it get in your way? or is it irrelevant?"},{"startMs":8518180,"durationMs":8900,"subtitle":"that's what you wanna know; if it helps you, you're happy about it; if it gets in your way, you're negatively predisposed towards it; if it's irrelevant, it's invisible"},{"startMs":8527080,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and so, if your little scheme is functional, your little frame is functional"},{"startMs":8533020,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"then most of the things that you encounter are mildly positive"},{"startMs":8536220,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"and that's how you know that you know what you're doing, that's how you validate the entire frame"},{"startMs":8540520,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"so okay, good"}]
