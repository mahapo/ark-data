[{"startMs":11520,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"OK, so"},{"startMs":15220,"durationMs":7900,"subtitle":"the last time we were here we got maybe a third of the way through this story"},{"startMs":23120,"durationMs":7180,"subtitle":"the story of Pinokio and the transformation of a marionette into something hypothetically real"},{"startMs":30300,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"I'm gonna backtrack a few slides and it'll get us into it again"},{"startMs":35780,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"so you remember that the blue fairy, so I would say that the benevolent element of mother nature"},{"startMs":43700,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"in the schemata that we are going to use to investigate mythology"},{"startMs":47540,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"was more or less allowed her entrance because Gepetto was a good guy and he wished for the right thing"},{"startMs":54500,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and so in some sense... here's a way of thinking about that... you know"},{"startMs":59060,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"genetic / environmental studies on children's temperament have revealed something quite interesting"},{"startMs":65940,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"which is that the shared environment that children have within a family"},{"startMs":72220,"durationMs":4220,"subtitle":"so that would be what's the same about your environment and your brother's environment, the same"},{"startMs":76440,"durationMs":3820,"subtitle":"doesn't have that much effect on your temperament or his temperament"},{"startMs":80260,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"'cause the presumption always was that within a family there is a shared environment, right?"},{"startMs":85100,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"and something was common about the environment to every child within that environment"},{"startMs":90000,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"but there isn't much of a shared environmental effect on temperament"},{"startMs":94100,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"so then you can say, well that makes it appear as though isn't that relevant in relationship to the development of temperament"},{"startMs":100480,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"but you could also suggest something else"},{"startMs":103440,"durationMs":8200,"subtitle":"you could suggest that if parenting is occurring properly, the effect of the shared environment should be very close to zero"},{"startMs":111640,"durationMs":6440,"subtitle":"and the reason for that is that you establish an individual relationship with each child"},{"startMs":118080,"durationMs":8440,"subtitle":"and the environment is actually a microenvironment that's composed of your observations of this child and that specific child's interaction with you"},{"startMs":126520,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"like to some degree, if there is a shared environment, that means that you're forcing the same principles on every child"},{"startMs":132680,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"so my suspicions are, although I don't know this, and the research hasn't been done"},{"startMs":137820,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"that in bad families there's a shared environmental effect, but in good families that minimizes"},{"startMs":143980,"durationMs":8320,"subtitle":"so that lets the child's biological predisposition, roughly, manifest itself with support and in some positive manner"},{"startMs":152300,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"well, I don't want to extend the analogy too far, but you can imagine"},{"startMs":158060,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"that, and this is what this film proposes, if you aim properly in relationship to your child"},{"startMs":164100,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"what you're trying to do is to establish an individual relationship and to allow them to move towards"},{"startMs":169180,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"whatever their particular expression of individuality happens to be"},{"startMs":174080,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and that's... that would be the same as allowing nature to take its course in some sense"},{"startMs":178900,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"at least nature in its positive guise, and that's exactly what happens here"},{"startMs":182400,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"the other thing that happens, of course, is that the cricket, for reasons that aren't clear, precisely"},{"startMs":189780,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"is knighted by the blue fairy and serves as Pinokio's conscience"},{"startMs":195740,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"although he isn't very good at it, which is a very peculiar thing, and quite a marked point that the film is making"},{"startMs":202600,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"that that conscience actually has something to learn, too"},{"startMs":205940,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"and there's actually a Freudian element to that, you know, because Freud thought of the superego"},{"startMs":210120,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"as the internalization, roughly speaking, of the father,"},{"startMs":214120,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"and it could be very severe, the superego, so like a really strict father, really tyrannical father inside your head"},{"startMs":220180,"durationMs":7540,"subtitle":"although I think it's better to think about the superego as the internalized representation of society at large"},{"startMs":227720,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"mediated to some degree through your parents, 'cause it's not as if your father, even assuming he's tyrannical"},{"startMs":233540,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"is the inventor of all those tyrannical rules, he's the propagator of them"},{"startMs":238580,"durationMs":6980,"subtitle":"but he's actually a proxy voice, even if it's just for the harsh side of society, he's the proxy voice for society"},{"startMs":245560,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and because we're social creatures, the utility of having an internal social voice to guide you"},{"startMs":252520,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"although, again, you seem to be able to follow it or not follow it, which I also find spectacularly interesting"},{"startMs":258000,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"because, obviously if it was an unerring guide, you could just follow it"},{"startMs":262760,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"and if it was an unerring guide, you wouldn't need free will either, because you could just act out the dictates of this internal representation"},{"startMs":270240,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"that isn't what you do"},{"startMs":272240,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"so anyways, the proposition here is that the conscience exists, but it's a relatively flawed entity"},{"startMs":278460,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"it needs to be modified as well by nature"},{"startMs":282620,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"which is quite interesting, 'cause the blue fairy knights him, 'cause you also might think of the conscience as only something that's socially constructed"},{"startMs":289880,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"right, which is the more typical viewpoint, but I don't buy that for a second"},{"startMs":293680,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"because I believe firmly, and I believe the Piagetian interpretation of child development"},{"startMs":301300,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"more or less bears this out, is that there are parameters within which conscience has to operate"},{"startMs":307800,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"and it's sort of like this, it's like, it's the same parameters that govern fair play, we'll say that"},{"startMs":314200,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"and so you can say there's fair play within a game, and there's fair play across sets of games"},{"startMs":320460,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"and the set of games is pretty much indistinguishable from the actual environment"},{"startMs":326220,"durationMs":8360,"subtitle":"if you think all the things you do as nested games, at some point the spread of that is large enough so that it encompasses everything you do"},{"startMs":334580,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"which includes the environment, and so I believe that you're adapted to the set of all possible games, roughly speaking"},{"startMs":342460,"durationMs":2980,"subtitle":"all possible playable games, something like that"},{"startMs":345440,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and that you know the rules for that, which is why, we talked about this a little bit, why you're so good at identifying cheaters"},{"startMs":351380,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"we have a module for that, according to the evolutionary psychologists"},{"startMs":354760,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"and not only you identify them, but you remember them, it really sticks in your mind"},{"startMs":359780,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"and there's other evidence, too, one piece of evidence that I love, well, there's a couple"},{"startMs":366240,"durationMs":8740,"subtitle":"one I would derive from Frans de Waal, who's a famous primatologis, and he studied the prototype morality that emerges in chimpanzees"},{"startMs":374980,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"and it's very much nested in their dominance structures"},{"startMs":378840,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"you know, because you could think of morality in some sense as the understanding of the rules by which the dominance hierarchy operates, right"},{"startMs":385680,"durationMs":4120,"subtitle":"and so you could say, well, the biggest, ugliest, meanest chimp..."},{"startMs":389800,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"and the male dominance hierarchies in chimps seem to be the predominant ones, although the females also have a dominance hierarchy"},{"startMs":394940,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"it's not quite so clear in bonobos, which seem to be more female-dominated"},{"startMs":399560,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"but in any case, the primary chimp dominance structure is male"},{"startMs":404940,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"and you could think, well it's like the caveman chimp who's biggest and toughest who necessarily rules, and who rules longest"},{"startMs":412440,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"but that isn't what de Waal found; see, the problem with being... mean, lets say"},{"startMs":418520,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"and not negotiating your social landscape, and not trading reciprocal favors"},{"startMs":424580,"durationMs":8140,"subtitle":"is that no matter how powerful you are as an individual, two individuals three quarters your power could do you in"},{"startMs":432720,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"and that happens with the chimps fairly regularly; if the guy on top is too tyrannical"},{"startMs":438940,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"and doesn't make social connections, then weaker chimps, males, make good social connections"},{"startMs":444040,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"and when he's not in such good shape, they take him down, and viciously too"},{"startMs":447940,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"de Waal has documented some unbelievably horrendous acts of, let's call it, regicide"},{"startMs":453780,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"among the chimpanzee troupes that he studied, mostly in the Arnhem zoo"},{"startMs":457860,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"the big troupe there, that's been there a long time"},{"startMs":461460,"durationMs":5540,"subtitle":"but he's very interested in prototypical morality, and here's some other examples of prototypical morality"},{"startMs":467000,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"emerging among animals, there's many of them, but one is"},{"startMs":470260,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"you know, if two wolves have a dominance dispute, again that would be more likely among the male wolves"},{"startMs":475120,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"but it doesn't really matter, they basically display their size, and they growl ferociously"},{"startMs":480620,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"and they puff up their hair so they look bigger, and you can see cats do that when they go into fight or flight"},{"startMs":486600,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"not only do they puff up, including their tail, but they stand sideways"},{"startMs":490800,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"and the reason they do that is because they look bigger"},{"startMs":493320,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"right, 'cause they're trying to put up the most intimidating possible front"},{"startMs":496700,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"so anyways, if two wolves are going at it, what they're really trying to do is to size each other up"},{"startMs":502300,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and they're trying to scare each other into backing off, fundamentally"},{"startMs":506060,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"because, see, the worst-case scenario is like, you're wolf number one, and I'm wolf number two"},{"startMs":511280,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and we tear each other to shreds, but I win, but I'm so damaged after that wolf number three comes in and takes me out"},{"startMs":517400,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"so, like, there's a big cost to be paid even for victory in a dominance dispute, if it degenerates into violence"},{"startMs":523900,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"and animals, and human beings, but animals in particular, have evolved very, very specific mechanisms"},{"startMs":530380,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"to escalate dominance disputes towards violence step by step"},{"startMs":536260,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"so that they don't... so that the victor doesn't risk incapacitating himself by winning"},{"startMs":542620,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"so what happens with the wolves is that, you know, they growl at each other and posture display, and maybe they even snap at each other"},{"startMs":549180,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"but the probability that they're gonna get into a full-fledged fight is pretty low"},{"startMs":553280,"durationMs":4220,"subtitle":"and what happens is, one of the wolves backs off, and flips over and shows his neck"},{"startMs":557500,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and that basically means: \"all right, tear it out,\" and the other wolf says:"},{"startMs":562280,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"though of course he doesn't, \"well, you're kind of an idiot, and you're not that strong, but we might need you to take down a moose in the future"},{"startMs":568500,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and, you know, despite your patheticness, I won't tear out your throat\""},{"startMs":572260,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"and then they've established their dominance position, and then, from then on, at least for some substantial period of time"},{"startMs":578240,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"the subordinate wolf gives way to the dominant wolf"},{"startMs":581380,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"but at least the subordinate wolf is alive, and, you know, he might be dominant over other wolves"},{"startMs":586140,"durationMs":6740,"subtitle":"and so, everyone in the whole hierarchy has sorted that out either through mock combat or through combat itself"},{"startMs":592880,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"and, you know, the low-ranking members aren't in the best possible position, but at least they're not getting their heads torn off every second of their existence"},{"startMs":601160,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"so there's even some utility in the stability of the dominance hierarchy for the low-ranking members"},{"startMs":606560,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"'cause at least they're not getting pounded, getting threatened, which is way better"},{"startMs":611300,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"I mean it's not good, but it's way better than actual combat"},{"startMs":614600,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"and then there's the example of rats, which I love, this is Jaak Panksepp's work"},{"startMs":618900,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"and he wrote a book called affective neuroscience, which I highly, highly recommend"},{"startMs":623360,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"I have a list of readings, recommended readings on my website"},{"startMs":626860,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"it's a brilliant book, and he's a brilliant psychologist, really, one of the top psychologists as far as I'm concerned"},{"startMs":633680,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"both theoretically and experimentally, a real genius, he's the guy who discovered that rats laugh when you tickle them"},{"startMs":640180,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"they laugh ultrasonically, so you can't actually hear them, but if you record it and slow it down"},{"startMs":645400,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them with an erase, which is sort of like their mother's tongue"},{"startMs":650240,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"it's often what lab people use as a substitute for the licking of the little rat by the mother"},{"startMs":655100,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"so, and he discovered the paly circuit in mammals, which is like a major deal, right"},{"startMs":660880,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"he should get a Nobel prize for that, that's a big deal to discover an entire motivational circuit"},{"startMs":665780,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"whose existence no one had really predicted, you know, apart from the fact that obviously mammals play"},{"startMs":671260,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and even lizards maybe, some of them are social lizards, seem to play"},{"startMs":675820,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"so, anyhow, what Panksepp observed, and I think this is a brilliant piece of science"},{"startMs":681800,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"is that, first of all, juvenile male rats in particular like to rough and tubmle play"},{"startMs":688200,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"like to wrestle, and they actually pin each other like little kids do, or like adult wrestlers do"},{"startMs":693420,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"they pin their shoulders down, and that basically means you win, and so, OK, so that's pretty cool"},{"startMs":698440,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"but what's even cooler, I think, well there's three things, one is:"},{"startMs":702180,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"the rats will work for an opportunity to get into an arena where they know that play might occur"},{"startMs":707340,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"and so that's one of the scientific ways of testing an animal's motivation, right"},{"startMs":711960,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"so imagine you have a starving rat and it knows that it's got food down in the end of a corridoor"},{"startMs":717580,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"you can put a little spring on its tail and measure how hard it pulls, and that gives you and idication of its motivational force"},{"startMs":723740,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"now, imagine the starving rat that's trying to get to some food, and you have a little spring on its tail, and you waft in some cat odor"},{"startMs":731000,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"so now that rat is starving and wants to get out of there, he's going to pull even farther towards the food"},{"startMs":737280,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"so getting away plus getting forward are separate motivational systems, and if you can add them together it's real potent"},{"startMs":743600,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"and part of the reason why in the future authoring exercise that you guys are gonna do as the class progresses"},{"startMs":749460,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"you're asked to outline the place you'd like to end up, which is your desired future"},{"startMs":753340,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"and also the place that you could end up if you let everything fall apart"},{"startMs":757960,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"so that your anxiety chases you and your approach systems pull you forward"},{"startMs":763460,"durationMs":7560,"subtitle":"you're maximally motivated then, and it's important, because otherwise you can be afraid of pursuing the things you wanna pursue"},{"startMs":771020,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"right, and that's very common, and so then the fear inhibits you as the promise pulls you forward"},{"startMs":776520,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"but it makes you weak, because you're afraid; you wanna get your fear behind you, pushing you"},{"startMs":781420,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"and so what you wanna be is more afraid of not pursuing your goals than you are of pursuing them"},{"startMs":787320,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"it's very, very helpful; and lots of times in life, and this is something really worth knowing"},{"startMs":792760,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"you know, and this is one of the advantages to being an autonomous adult"},{"startMs":796940,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"you don't get to pick the best thing, you get to pick your poison"},{"startMs":800500,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"you have two bad choices, and you get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through"},{"startMs":804760,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"and every choice has a bit of that element in it, and so, if you know that it's really freeing"},{"startMs":810100,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"because otherwise you torture yourself by thinking: \"well, maybe there's a good solution to this, compared to the bad solution\""},{"startMs":816700,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"it's like, no, no, sometime's there's just risky solution 1, and risky solution 2"},{"startMs":821820,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and sometimes both of them are really bad, but you at least get to pick which one you're willing to suffer through"},{"startMs":828000,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and that's... that actually makes quite a bit of difference, because you're also facing it voluntarily then"},{"startMs":833380,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"instead of it chasing you, and that is an entirely different psychophysiological response"},{"startMs":839200,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"challenge vs threat, it's not the same, even if the magnitude of the problem is the same"},{"startMs":845240,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"and so putting yourself in a challenging, let's call it, mindframe, you can't just do that by magic"},{"startMs":850260,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"putting yourself in a challenging mindframe is much easier on you psychophysiologically"},{"startMs":855700,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"'cause you don't produce... you don't go into the generalized stress response to the same degree"},{"startMs":860360,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"and you're activating your exploratory and seeking systems, which are dopaminergically mediated, and that involve positive emotion"},{"startMs":866720,"durationMs":7340,"subtitle":"so if you can face something voluntarily, rather than having it chase you, it's way better for you psychophysiologically"},{"startMs":874060,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"so, that's partly why, well, it's worthwhile to go find the dragon in its lair instead of waiting for it to come and eat you"},{"startMs":882040,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"so, and especially if you also add the idea that if you go find the dragon in its lair"},{"startMs":887020,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"you might find it when it's a baby, instead of a full-fledged bloody monster that is definitely gonna take you down"},{"startMs":893040,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"and so that's part of the reason why... well there's a whole bunch of things that emerge out of that observation"},{"startMs":900520,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"like: don't avoid small problems that you know are there"},{"startMs":904720,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"face them, because they'll grow into big problems all by themselves"},{"startMs":909100,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"and you can think about... imagine the tax department sends you a notification, you owe them, like, 300 dollars"},{"startMs":915260,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"well it's, you know, that's annoying, maybe you don't even wanna open the letter"},{"startMs":919940,"durationMs":5540,"subtitle":"or maybe if you do, you just put it on the shelf, but that damn thing doesn't just sit there like a piece of paper on the shelf"},{"startMs":925480,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"right, you ignore that for 5 or 6 years, it's gonna become attached to all sorts of horrible things"},{"startMs":931100,"durationMs":8200,"subtitle":"and if you ignore it long enough... you get the idea, it's gonna turn into something that's completely unlike the little piece of paper that it's written on"},{"startMs":939300,"durationMs":7800,"subtitle":"and many, many problems in life are like that, you'll see that they pop their ugly little head up, and you know"},{"startMs":947100,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"and you might wanna turn away, you might not want to think about it"},{"startMs":951480,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"which is the easiest way of turning away, right, you just don't attend to it"},{"startMs":955160,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"it's not like you repress it or anything like that, you just fail to attend to it"},{"startMs":959160,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and that's a... really, as a long-term strategy it's dismal"},{"startMs":963820,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"it's also something, I think, that's more characteristic of people who are high in neuroticism and high in agreeableness"},{"startMs":969140,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"'cause agreeable people don't like conflict"},{"startMs":971260,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and people who are high in neuroticism, or high in negative emotion, are hit harder per unit of uncertainty or threat"},{"startMs":978220,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"and so, you know, and that's partly why in psychotherapy a lot of times the people you see need assertiveness training"},{"startMs":984760,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"so that would be the opposite of agreeableness, or they need help to get their anxiety and emotional pain under control"},{"startMs":990720,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"those are not the only reasons, there's antisocial behavior, but you can't fix that in therapy in all likelyhood"},{"startMs":995860,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"there's alcoholism, there's lotsa, lotsa other reasons, but those are two major reasons"},{"startMs":999820,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"so anyways, there is a... that was all to telly you that... oh yes, back to the rats"},{"startMs":1006340,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"so okay, the rats are pulling on... you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on the spring, let's say"},{"startMs":1012520,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"and they're more motivated if they're running away and they're running towards, but let's go back to play"},{"startMs":1017720,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"so, you can take juvenile rats who haven't been able to play for a while, maybe they've been isolated"},{"startMs":1022300,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity, like many schoolchildren that you might be thinking about"},{"startMs":1029520,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"neither allowed to play nor engage in physical activity, and there's a reason I'm telling you that"},{"startMs":1035240,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"so anyways, you get one of these little rats, and you can measure how hard he'll pull to go out and play"},{"startMs":1040820,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation"},{"startMs":1044880,"durationMs":7780,"subtitle":"so anyways, you can see that the play-deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non-play deprived juvenile rat"},{"startMs":1052660,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"and so you can infer that the rat wants to go play"},{"startMs":1057140,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"and, you know, you do that... you do the same measurement with everyone around you"},{"startMs":1061900,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"if they wanna do something, you're gonna poke and prod at them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome"},{"startMs":1067800,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"in order to go and do that, you'll object even if you don't really object"},{"startMs":1071480,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"it's like... it's a measurement device, and if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections"},{"startMs":1076580,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"then you think: \"oh, well, maybe they really want to\""},{"startMs":1078920,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"and that's another thing to really know: if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you want it"},{"startMs":1086660,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"because the probability that the person who's opposing you will have five arguments about why you should't have it is very low"},{"startMs":1093680,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"they just won't have thought it through enough; so the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercise"},{"startMs":1098260,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"is that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future"},{"startMs":1104620,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"so you're asked like: \"why would it be good for you? why would it be good for your family? why would it be good for broader society?\""},{"startMs":1110500,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"so that gives you three levels of argumentation right there"},{"startMs":1113660,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"and if you have it articulated down into detail, and it's related to other important goals"},{"startMs":1118280,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"they you're a hell of a thing to argue with, because people just aren't that deep"},{"startMs":1123500,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"by which I mean that they just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection"},{"startMs":1128860,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"and it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind, because if you want to do something that's difficult"},{"startMs":1133840,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems in your mind are gonna throw up objections"},{"startMs":1139080,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"it's like, \"well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now, maybe you should be doing the dishes"},{"startMs":1143060,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"or vacuuming, or watching TV, or looking at YouTube\""},{"startMs":1145960,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"if you're really sneaky, when you're trying to do something hard, what your brain does"},{"startMs":1151000,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"is give you something else hard to do that 's not quite as hard, so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you're supposed to"},{"startMs":1156580,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"'cause you're doing somethig else useful, and if you give in to that temptation, which you often will"},{"startMs":1161380,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"then it wins, and because it wins, it gets a little dopamine kick, and it grows stronger"},{"startMs":1166280,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"anything you let win the internal argument, grows"},{"startMs":1170920,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"and anything you let be defeated, shrinks"},{"startMs":1173960,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"'cause it's punished, it doesn't get to have its way"},{"startMs":1177180,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"so that's another thing really to remember, don't practice what you do not wanna become"},{"startMs":1182700,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"and because those are... they're neurological circuits, you build those thing in there man, and they're not going anywhere"},{"startMs":1189040,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"you can build another little machine to inhibit them, that's the best you can do"},{"startMs":1193020,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"once they're in there, you can't get them out, so... and then the one's you built to inhibit can be taken out by stress"},{"startMs":1199700,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"and the old habits will come back up, so you gotta be careful what you say and what you do"},{"startMs":1204760,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"because you build yourself that way; so anyways, back to the rats"},{"startMs":1209400,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"okay, so the little rat gets to go out there and play, now imagine one little rat is paired with another rat"},{"startMs":1214220,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"but the other little rat is 10% bigger, 10% in juvenile rats is enough to attain permanent dominance"},{"startMs":1221600,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"so the 10% bigger rat will win the first wrestling, and so that's what happens"},{"startMs":1228380,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and then... so the little rat gets pinned, and maybe they play a bit, and then they're done with it"},{"startMs":1233200,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"and so you separate them, then you let them play again, and the next time what happens"},{"startMs":1237260,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"is that the subordinate rat does the invitation to play"},{"startMs":1240940,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"and that's like, you know, like a dog does when he wants to play"},{"startMs":1244080,"durationMs":4620,"subtitle":"you can recognize that, it kind of splays its feet apart, and looks up and looks interested"},{"startMs":1248700,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"and then it sort of dances around; you can do it with any kid that has a clue, you know"},{"startMs":1253040,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"that hasn't been destroyed by adults, if your little 3-year-old, or 4-year-olds are better for this"},{"startMs":1258320,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"if you go like this, like, they know exactly what's gonna happen, you know, they're ready to dart back and forth"},{"startMs":1262900,"durationMs":7460,"subtitle":"and they'll usually smile, and kids love rough and tumble play, which is now basically illegal in all daycare"},{"startMs":1270360,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"seriously, it's seriously is, kids need it so desperately, 'cause it teaches them the limits of their body"},{"startMs":1276500,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"and your body, and it teaches them what's painful and what isn't"},{"startMs":1280460,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"and it teaches them the dance of play, and without that they're just little disembodied blobs"},{"startMs":1286160,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"like, they have no finesse, that's what you're checking out when you dance with someone, you know"},{"startMs":1290460,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"you're seeing if they have that fluency and facility for mutual reciprocal action"},{"startMs":1296660,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"embodied in them; and if they're kinda like this, you know, and don't have any sense of rhythm and don't pay any attention to you"},{"startMs":1303560,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and all of that, you have reason to question whether they actually inhabit their body"},{"startMs":1308520,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"and whether they can engage in a mutual interaction, physical interaction that's going to be reciprocal and mutually satisfying"},{"startMs":1316000,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"it's really important to check out; and a lot of that rough and tubmle play, even interactions between a child and its mother"},{"startMs":1322940,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"if you have a happy mother and a happy infant, and you videotape them, and you speed up the video tape, you'll see that they're dancing"},{"startMs":1330460,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"so one responds, then the other responds, then the other responds, it might be just with eye gaze, and movement, and all of that"},{"startMs":1336700,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"but there's a dynamic interplay, which you don't see with depressed mothers and their infants"},{"startMs":1341680,"durationMs":7100,"subtitle":"so, okay, so back to play, so the little rat, who is the subordinate one, he has to do the invitation"},{"startMs":1348780,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and then the big rat can agree to play, 'cause he's in the dominant position"},{"startMs":1353520,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"but if you pair them repeatedly, and this is really worth thinking about"},{"startMs":1358240,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"because, you see, morality emerges out of repeated interactions"},{"startMs":1362440,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"because, you might say, if you only interact with someone once, you might as well just take advantage of them and run off"},{"startMs":1368280,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"that's what a psychopath does, by the way, and there is room in the environmental niche for psychopaths"},{"startMs":1375400,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"but they have to keep moving around, 'cause otherwise people figure out who they are"},{"startMs":1378940,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"so they just move around, and they can take advantage of one person, you know, maybe five times, or ten times, or something"},{"startMs":1384600,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"and then the reputation spreads, and they gotta get the hell out of there"},{"startMs":1388160,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"but... so it's not a good long-term strategy, unless you can't think of a better one"},{"startMs":1392620,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"so anyways, if you repeatedly pair these rats, unless the big rat lets the little rat win at least 30% of the time"},{"startMs":1400460,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"the little rat will not ask the big rat to play"},{"startMs":1403460,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"and that is... it's a staggering discovery, it's a staggering discovery"},{"startMs":1408520,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"because you've got the emergence there of an implicit morality, essentially"},{"startMs":1413220,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"that's even incarnated in rats, that emerges across multiple play sessions"},{"startMs":1417380,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"it's like, yes, exaclty, that's exactly what Piaget said about the emergence of morality"},{"startMs":1422320,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"it's exactly the same idea, at the rat level, so it's a massively..."},{"startMs":1427020,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"and the fact that there's a circuit, a separate neurophysiological circuit"},{"startMs":1431040,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that's actually specialized for that sort of thing is also a big deal"},{"startMs":1435120,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"now the other thing Panksepp figured out is that if you deprive juvenile rats of the opportunity to engage in rough and tumble play"},{"startMs":1442620,"durationMs":2620,"subtitle":"their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly"},{"startMs":1445240,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"and they become impulsive and restless, and then you can fix them with methylphenidate or ritalin"},{"startMs":1451340,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"and those are the drugs that are used to fix hyperactive kids, most of who are male"},{"startMs":1457880,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"and that's because, well, really, you're gonna take your six-year-old, your five-year-old"},{"startMs":1462940,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"you're gonna put them in a desk, you're gonna get them to sit there for six hours, that's your plan, right?"},{"startMs":1468820,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"that's a stupid plan; and they're denied the opportunity to engage in play"},{"startMs":1474460,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and that means that their ability to become social is being impaired"},{"startMs":1479640,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"it may cause neurological impairment, that's what the rat evidence suggests"},{"startMs":1483380,"durationMs":6100,"subtitle":"and then you suppress that with amphetamines, 'cause amphetamines actually activate the play circuit"},{"startMs":1489480,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"they activate a different circuit, which will suppress the play circuit"},{"startMs":1493320,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"so it's very, very... it's not very wise, and I'm not gonna go off on that tangent"},{"startMs":1498720,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"because I could tell you why the school systems were set up that way, which I probably will at some point"},{"startMs":1504000,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"because it's quite and interesting story in and of itself, and it's the reason all you guys are sitting in desks right now"},{"startMs":1510400,"durationMs":7460,"subtitle":"somebody laughingly referred to this once as grade 15, that was pretty funny, given the look of the bloody place, you know"},{"startMs":1517860,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"hideous... okay"},{"startMs":1522020,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"so, now, this is an interesting thig, so you got the emergence of morality in, say chimps"},{"startMs":1527900,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"you got the emergence of morality in wolves, you got the emergence of morality in rats"},{"startMs":1531600,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"and the morality governs sequential interactions or group interactions, they have to repeat"},{"startMs":1537760,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"because, because it's an emerging property of social or repetitive interactions"},{"startMs":1543180,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"that's why, you can't just localize it in one instance, it's repeated"},{"startMs":1547260,"durationMs":2740,"subtitle":"and there's been computer simulations of this"},{"startMs":1550000,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"they help you figure out how you might attain victory across games, across time"},{"startMs":1554660,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"maybe you need a strategy, and there's a very simple strategy, which, I believe is called \"modified tit for tat\""},{"startMs":1561480,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"so if you're nice to me, I'm nice back, and if you do something bad to me, I do something bad back"},{"startMs":1566000,"durationMs":7180,"subtitle":"but imagine you run that out in sequences of behavior, and see who does with what strategy across time"},{"startMs":1573180,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"or an alternative strategy... [?] here's the best strategy: I trust you, you trust me, we start interacting"},{"startMs":1579660,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"you screw up, I whack you, and then I forgive you, and we start again"},{"startMs":1583620,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"that's modified tit for tat, and so..."},{"startMs":1586480,"durationMs":9580,"subtitle":"it's a very simple algorithm; no one has come up with a better algorithm in a computerized simulation of game space than that particular strategy"},{"startMs":1596060,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"so it's like: trust but don't be a pushover, if someone violates the rules, you gotta nail them"},{"startMs":1601960,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"but then you don't hold a grudge, you open the door to further interactions"},{"startMs":1606000,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"so, pretty smart, pretty smart"},{"startMs":1608880,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and, okay, so anyways... so what this means, 'cause rats can't talk, and wolves can't talk, and chimpanzees can't talk"},{"startMs":1615840,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and what that means, just as Piaget suggested, was that the morality, the development of the morality"},{"startMs":1621960,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"precedes the development of the linguistic ability to describe the rules for the morality"},{"startMs":1626720,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"he said exactly the same thing about kids, right, is that they learn to play games before they know what the rules are to the games"},{"startMs":1633920,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"and so, you see that when you're playing peek-a-boo with a kid, they can pick that up really young"},{"startMs":1638760,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"they get that right away, and there's... you can play with kids almost immediately after they're born, if you play simple enough games"},{"startMs":1645320,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"so they've got that deep, and they're unbelievably playful"},{"startMs":1648500,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"so, they've got that circuitry ready to go right off the bat, and it's one of the things that makes kids so much fun"},{"startMs":1655360,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"because they just like to play all the time, and so if you... if the play circuit in you hasn't died"},{"startMs":1662440,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"which is a bad thing, then you can use that a lot with your kids, and it's one of the things that helps you love them"},{"startMs":1668120,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"so that's a good thing, so, okay"},{"startMs":1671400,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"so, the point is that the damn morality emerges before the representation of the morality"},{"startMs":1678280,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"it's a big deal to know that, and that it emerges as a consequence of repeated social interaction"},{"startMs":1683600,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"so it's not a top-down thing, it's a bottom-up thing"},{"startMs":1687560,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"now, Piaget says: well, it's not just bottom-up, because what happens with human beings is that they learn to play the games..."},{"startMs":1693860,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"one of his experiments was: watch seven-year-olds, I think that's the right age, play marbles"},{"startMs":1700620,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"and then he noticed that they can play with each other, and that they can follow the rules"},{"startMs":1705200,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"but that if you take the individual seven-year-old out of the game, and you say: what are the rules?"},{"startMs":1709600,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"they give incoherent and incomplete explanations of the rules"},{"startMs":1713360,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"so what that means is they don't really represent the rules, but they can act them out"},{"startMs":1718120,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"and have a partial representation of what they're acting out"},{"startMs":1721880,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"now, when they get older, the rule representation starts to fall into alignment with the actual rules of the game"},{"startMs":1727620,"durationMs":6180,"subtitle":"and you can imagine that's why [?], because when they're playing something like marbles, they're gonna have discussions like: you're cheating"},{"startMs":1733800,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"or: you're not allowed to do that, 'cause they're always gonna be pushing the envelope a little bit"},{"startMs":1738080,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and then the group is gonna render a judgment on whether or not that's appropriate"},{"startMs":1741920,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"and out of that the rules are going emerge, but they're not rules to begin with, they're patterns of behavior"},{"startMs":1747540,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"it's not the same thing as a rule, a rule describes a pattern of behavior"},{"startMs":1752200,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"but a pattern of behavior is a pattern of behavior, it's something that's acted out"},{"startMs":1756380,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"so, there's the individual within the group and then the interactions of the individuals within the group produce a hierarchical arrangement"},{"startMs":1764480,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"or multiple hierarchical arrangements, those are games, roughly speaking, or stories"},{"startMs":1769520,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"nested iside an overarching story, which is the fundamental culture"},{"startMs":1773560,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"right, and that's nested within a whole bunch of competing cultures that have some commonalities"},{"startMs":1778540,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"or they would just be at war all the time, which, you know, to some degree they are"},{"startMs":1784360,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"so, okay, now, you see that... back to the movie, you see that happening in the movie"},{"startMs":1791300,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"I mean it's very, very quick, but the blue fairy turns the bug into the conscience"},{"startMs":1797660,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"and then the bug tries to explain to Pinokio what the rules of morality are"},{"startMs":1802600,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"but the thing is the bug doesn't know, because he's just a bug, and you know, he's just not omniscient, so"},{"startMs":1807740,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"the best he can do is to come up with, like, a propagandistic semantic, verbal representation"},{"startMs":1815660,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"that's internally contradictory, and when he tells Pinokio, Pinokio has no idea what he's talking about"},{"startMs":1820960,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"and neither does the bug, that's the thing; and so..."},{"startMs":1824600,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"so what happens is this, the cricket says: well Pinok, maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk"},{"startMs":1829960,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"and the puppet says: why? and the cricket says: well, you wanna be a real boy, don't you?"},{"startMs":1836440,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"alright, sit down son, now you see the world as full of temptations"},{"startMs":1841760,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"- temptations? - yes, temptations, they're the wrong things that seem right at the time"},{"startMs":1847280,"durationMs":8260,"subtitle":"but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes, sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time"},{"startMs":1855540,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"or vice versa, understand? - no!"},{"startMs":1860820,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"no, and neither did the cricket, and that's actually very nicely done in that piece of the movie"},{"startMs":1866880,"durationMs":4180,"subtitle":"because you just wanna slap him as soon as he starts talking like that"},{"startMs":1871060,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"because he gets up on his little matchbox and lectures, and he's dull and tyrannical, both at the same time"},{"startMs":1877300,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and so there's nothing genuine about what he's saying, he's imitating something that isn't him"},{"startMs":1882980,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"so he's really acting like a puppet at that point, too, and it doesn't work at all"},{"startMs":1887260,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"and so Pinokio says: I'm going to try to be a good boy; and the cricket says: well that's the spirit, son"},{"startMs":1893820,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"and then away they go, so..."},{"startMs":1896680,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"alright, so then we're at the next day, 'cause this all happens in one night"},{"startMs":1901180,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"we're at the next day, and you know, it's a nice day, and there's these birds flying around"},{"startMs":1904760,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"that's actually, that's a bit of foreshadowing there, you know"},{"startMs":1908140,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"so, um, you have to remember, when you watch something like this movie"},{"startMs":1913980,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"not a single bit of it is random or accidental, none of it"},{"startMs":1918000,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"because, you know, they had to draw I don't remember how many frames per second these things are"},{"startMs":1924520,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"thirty, maybe, if it's high-quality animation; so someone had to paint thirty pictures to get a second of this"},{"startMs":1930640,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"you're not doing that accidentally, it's really expensive, and everyone has to agree on exactly what's going to happen"},{"startMs":1936480,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"and you might say: well, do the people who are doing this consciously know what they're doing?"},{"startMs":1941000,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and the answer to that is: well, sort of, just like you do, it's yes, they know, and no, they don't"},{"startMs":1947120,"durationMs":5900,"subtitle":"and they know because they're really smart and gifted, and all that, but they don't know, because it's not all articulated"},{"startMs":1953020,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"plus they're working in a group, so they know and don't know, just like you do when you're watching it"},{"startMs":1958800,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"and so... and when you do anything else..."},{"startMs":1961640,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"now, they're also guided by what you might call... they're guided by their unconscious"},{"startMs":1966840,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"in the Freudian, and in the cognitive way, partly because"},{"startMs":1970300,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"your unconscious value structures determine the direction and content of your perceptions"},{"startMs":1975440,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"so it's built right into the way you move your eyes, 'cause you tend to look at things you value"},{"startMs":1980660,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"right, or at things you're afraid of, like you look at things with valence"},{"startMs":1985060,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and part of the decision about what has value is dependent on the implicit structure of your moral system"},{"startMs":1991000,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"because morality is about what's good, and what isn't"},{"startMs":1993940,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"and that's been partly a conscious construction of you, but it's partly partly something you've been..."},{"startMs":1998620,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you've picked up by interacting with people like mad since you were born"},{"startMs":2001980,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"you don't know all the rules anymore than the damn cricked did"},{"startMs":2005120,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"you just don't, and you can't, 'cause you're too complicated, but you act them out"},{"startMs":2011500,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"and then you also have representations of how people act, in your imagination"},{"startMs":2016660,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"that's what a dream is, that's what a fantasy is, that's what that little movie that plays inside your head when you remember what you did is"},{"startMs":2023620,"durationMs":9060,"subtitle":"and you only remember the gist, you know, so even the imagistic representation of your behavior in your past, which is basically your episodic memory"},{"startMs":2032680,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"it's already selecting, and molding, and turning it into a relatable story"},{"startMs":2038080,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"it can't help but do that, it's the only way you can represent it"},{"startMs":2041800,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and so you don't know how you do that or why you do that, but part of it's governed by this implicit morality"},{"startMs":2047160,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"it's part of your procedural memory, part of the way you act, part of the way you move your eyes, and listen to things, and focus on them"},{"startMs":2054480,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"that's all been instantiated inside of you because of your biology, but also this immense social project"},{"startMs":2060860,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"that you're continually engaged in"},{"startMs":2063020,"durationMs":6780,"subtitle":"and so, that informs what you remember, it informs what you imagine, it informs what we collectively imagine"},{"startMs":2069800,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"it informs what we can collectively understand"},{"startMs":2072640,"durationMs":9340,"subtitle":"and partly what you're doing while you become conscious of yourself is to map the implicit structures that already constitute you"},{"startMs":2081980,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"from society into explicit representation"},{"startMs":2085680,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"that's what self-understanding means; and you know, when you have that moment of insight about something you've done"},{"startMs":2091180,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"it's like you're watching this repetitive behavior that you've manifested, probably that got you in trouble"},{"startMs":2096560,"durationMs":4020,"subtitle":"you know, it's your characteristic way of falling accidentally into chaos"},{"startMs":2100580,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and you talk about it, your problems, you talk about them with your friends, you talk about them"},{"startMs":2105240,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"and maybe you have dreams about them, and you're trying to relate them"},{"startMs":2108060,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"and you have memories about them that you can't get rid of, 'cause they're negatively toned"},{"startMs":2111280,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"so you talk about them, and then someone comes up with a little statement that links them together causally"},{"startMs":2116460,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"and you thing: aha! that's what I'm doing; and then maybe you can stop doing it"},{"startMs":2121280,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"or at least maybe then you can thing of some strategies for not doing it anymore"},{"startMs":2126900,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"but it's not like you know, it's like you're acting it out, you know it that way"},{"startMs":2132060,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"but until the representation matches that pattern, that click of insight doesn't occur"},{"startMs":2139380,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"and that's like a revelation, it's a really good way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":2143000,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"because the knowledge is there in its implicit form, and all of a sudden, bang! it's been made explicit"},{"startMs":2148940,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"as a fantasy maybe, or also as a set of semantic statements"},{"startMs":2153720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"you know, maybe you have a crush on someone and you don't notice it"},{"startMs":2157320,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"and maybe you find yourself having a fantasy about them, you think: oh! that means something!"},{"startMs":2163820,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"maybe you don't want to know that that's what you want, but the fantasy will tell you"},{"startMs":2168780,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"and one of the things Jung suggested, and this is sort of out of the freudian tradition of free association"},{"startMs":2175660,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"is: watch yourself, watch your fantasies, because they're always happening, and they'll tell you something"},{"startMs":2182300,"durationMs":7260,"subtitle":"and so, one of the things I do when I'm interacting with my clients is we'll have a discussion, and then their eyes will drift a little bit"},{"startMs":2189560,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"and I'll know that something's flitted through their mind, you know"},{"startMs":2193600,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and that means we've touched on something that has a multiplicity of elements"},{"startMs":2198480,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"and so I'll stop and say: look, I noticed that you... maybe you teared up, that's another thing to really watch"},{"startMs":2203600,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"or maybe you laughed, or you drifted at least, it's like... it's because some other thought has entered your field of consciousness"},{"startMs":2209800,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"and if you can get the person to grab those thoughts, to notice them"},{"startMs":2213840,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"then you can often figure out the avenues along which that particular conversation might unfold"},{"startMs":2219860,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"that's a complex, that's a Jungian complex or a psychoanalytic complex"},{"startMs":2223420,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"it's like, there's an emotional core that produces a whole range of associated ideas"},{"startMs":2228500,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"and that thing's got a life, it's like a micropersonality, and it might have resentment in it, might have anger"},{"startMs":2234220,"durationMs":7900,"subtitle":"it's often negative emotion-tinged, because negative emotion-tinged episodes are still problems"},{"startMs":2242120,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"and they will emerge automatically, 'cause you're threat detection systems force them onto your consciousness, essentially"},{"startMs":2248620,"durationMs":7640,"subtitle":"so you watch, and when you drift... you'll drift, and the fantasy is partly a representation of of the problem space"},{"startMs":2256260,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"you know, that happens when you wake up at three in the morning and you're worried about things"},{"startMs":2259780,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"right, 'cause actually what happens is you wake up during threat processing"},{"startMs":2263920,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and if you're depressed, actually that gets so intense, you can't sleep, so then you just lay there all night, worrying"},{"startMs":2269560,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"not fun, and those are fantasies about the negative elements of your past, present and future"},{"startMs":2275120,"durationMs":7640,"subtitle":"and the fantasies can also breed solutions, and that's partly why Freud regarded dreams as wish-fulfillments"},{"startMs":2282760,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"it's partly... and he wasn't... that was where he stopped; it's not correct"},{"startMs":2289080,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"it's partially correct, it's like the fantasy will provide you with a problem and a potential solution"},{"startMs":2295940,"durationMs":8700,"subtitle":"but they're more like problem-identification mechanisms, the fantasies, with the possibility of a solution built in"},{"startMs":2304640,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"and so, a way of thinking about that is that you can generate potential futures"},{"startMs":2311520,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"so they're like each segregateable environments, according to the rules of your fantasy"},{"startMs":2316260,"durationMs":5720,"subtitle":"then you can generate little avatars of yourself that inhabit each of those little universes, and you can run them as simulations"},{"startMs":2321980,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"and then you can watch what happens in the simulation, and if it's a catastrophy, then you don't have to act it out"},{"startMs":2327900,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"and that's exactly, not exactly, that's akin to what you're doing when you go watch a movie"},{"startMs":2333200,"durationMs":7720,"subtitle":"except that is much more coherent and well thought-through, than just a dream, which is often quite fragmentary"},{"startMs":2340920,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"that's partly 'cause the dream is willing to sacrifice coherence to play with category structures"},{"startMs":2348320,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"you know, and that's why in dreams things can change one thing into another really weirdly"},{"startMs":2352080,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"or scenes can change from one scene into another without a logic, the logic gets loosened"},{"startMs":2357600,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"so that the expanse of your thinking can widen"},{"startMs":2360820,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"and it's dangerous to do that, and that's partly why you do it while you're asleep and paralyzed"},{"startMs":2366060,"durationMs":8560,"subtitle":"you know, you don't run around and act out your pseudopodal fantasies, where you're stretching yourself out into the world"},{"startMs":2374620,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"there's no risk, exactly, although it can be bad enough so you'll wake up in terror"},{"startMs":2379420,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"but that's better than being in a crocodile's mouth by a large margin"},{"startMs":2383380,"durationMs":7460,"subtitle":"anyways, back to these birds, these are used later in the movie as manifestations of the Holy Spirit, roughly speaking"},{"startMs":2390840,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"and of course that's a standard Christian symbol, although, as I mentioned"},{"startMs":2394380,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"the dove often represents the Holy Spirit, and we'll talk about that later"},{"startMs":2399420,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"but this movie has very strong pagan elements in it, as I mentioned before"},{"startMs":2405500,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"as opposed to strictly Christian symbolism"},{"startMs":2408960,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"but that's foreshadowing, and what it foreshadows is that, well, a new day has dawned"},{"startMs":2413920,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"it's the emergence of new consciousness, and everything last night went well, really well"},{"startMs":2419280,"durationMs":6380,"subtitle":"everything in the... let's call it the unconscious, say, after time stops, that all went well, and so the new day is full of promise"},{"startMs":2425660,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and so, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining, and, like, hurray"},{"startMs":2430220,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"this is the next scene, right, so it sets the tenor for that scene just like the introductory song does"},{"startMs":2438200,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"so anyways, then you see all these kids playing and enthusiastic, so they're off to school"},{"startMs":2444560,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"which is presented in a positive light, and so that's where you get socialized"},{"startMs":2448760,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"so Pinokio's ready to go beyond the boundaries of the familial home"},{"startMs":2453880,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"and he's ready because his father prepared him, and his mother prepared him"},{"startMs":2458460,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and so he goes off, and he's not going off alone, he's going with his conscience"},{"startMs":2461980,"durationMs":5620,"subtitle":"you can think about it, again, as the internalized representation of nature and society"},{"startMs":2467600,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"and so he's not going out there alone, even though he's not very good at it"},{"startMs":2471580,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"he's pretty excited about it, and so is Gepetto; see, Gepetto isn't standing there paralyzed with terror"},{"startMs":2477560,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"and the kid isn't phobic of the outside world, and so he's treating it as an adventure"},{"startMs":2484060,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"even though, well, it's an adventure, but adventures can be dangerous"},{"startMs":2489940,"durationMs":9380,"subtitle":"you can imagine a kid, especially one who's, like, high in neuroticism, who hasn't been encouraged sufficiently to overcome that, let's say"},{"startMs":2499320,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"their primary idea might be: well, what if the other kids don't like me"},{"startMs":2504260,"durationMs":3380,"subtitle":"that's a big one; what if the teachers don't like me, what if the other kids won't play with me"},{"startMs":2507640,"durationMs":7500,"subtitle":"it's like, yeah, what if, that's rough, man, and if you're not a playful kid, it could easily be the case"},{"startMs":2515140,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"so... but that's not Pinokio, he's like, spinning out, ready to go"},{"startMs":2519500,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"and so... good, good, he's got... naive, but enthusiastic, ok, well at least that gets the ball rolling"},{"startMs":2526540,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"now, you've got these two evil creatures here, the fox and the cat"},{"startMs":2531740,"durationMs":6140,"subtitle":"I think this one's based on one of the Marx brothers, actually, Harpo Marx, who, I believe, never said anything"},{"startMs":2537880,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"but, be that as it may, they're these ne'er-do-well characters, the fox in particular"},{"startMs":2543260,"durationMs":10720,"subtitle":"now fox is standard trickster animal, right, it's a... classic animal, maybe because it's good at hiding, and it's good at hunting"},{"startMs":2553980,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"I don't know exactly why, but coyotes are like that, too"},{"startMs":2558020,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"they're classic trickster animals, he's kinda like Wile E. Coyote, in fact"},{"startMs":2563020,"durationMs":8140,"subtitle":"you know, the Warner Brothers character who's genius at large, and whose arrogance continually gets him wallopped"},{"startMs":2571160,"durationMs":8380,"subtitle":"and this character has a lot of features like that, but he feigns being an English gentleman of the 1890s"},{"startMs":2579540,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"and pretends to be educated, and has a kinda high-blown way of talking, and he's a fraud through and through"},{"startMs":2586500,"durationMs":9220,"subtitle":"and he's got this sidekick who's barely there at all, and he doesn't treat him that well"},{"startMs":2595720,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"but he's got someone to lord it over, so that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well"},{"startMs":2600780,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"and the fact that he's like a second-rate companion, well, he never really notices that"},{"startMs":2605760,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"although he'll treat him contemptuously whenever he gets a chance"},{"startMs":2608680,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"so anyways, they're walking down the street, and the fox is bragging away about some crooked thing that he's done"},{"startMs":2615580,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"how he pulled the wool over someone's eyes, and he confuses that with wisdom and intelligence"},{"startMs":2621100,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"and one of the things that you see, this is worth knowing too, because"},{"startMs":2624940,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"if you're preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life"},{"startMs":2631160,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"the psychopath, who will be narcissistic, will presume that you're stupid"},{"startMs":2636720,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"and that you deserve to be taken advantage of, because you're naive and stupid, so it's actually a good thing that he's doing it"},{"startMs":2642720,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and his proof... and I'm saying \"he,\" because there are more male psychopaths"},{"startMs":2648560,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"the proof that you're stupid and naive is that he can take advantage of you"},{"startMs":2654200,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"and so, like, if you were wiser, you'd be a, you know, you'd know his tricks"},{"startMs":2658840,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"then it wouldn't be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what"},{"startMs":2664880,"durationMs":11220,"subtitle":"and so, the psychopath will use his ability to fool you as proof of his own grandiose omnipotence, omniscience, and narcissism"},{"startMs":2676100,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath, and virtually anybody can"},{"startMs":2681740,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"so that Robert Hare, for example, who's studied psychopaths for a long time"},{"startMs":2685840,"durationMs":5160,"subtitle":"and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them, and videotaped many of the interviews"},{"startMs":2691000,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"he said when he was talking to the psychopath he always believed what they were saying"},{"startMs":2693880,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"and then he's watch the video afterwards, and see where the conversation went off the rails"},{"startMs":2698540,"durationMs":7700,"subtitle":"but, you know, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very strong"},{"startMs":2706240,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"and if you're polite, you don't object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy, you know"},{"startMs":2712200,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate, obviously, how to manipulate people"},{"startMs":2717840,"durationMs":3660,"subtitle":"and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low"},{"startMs":2721500,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"go watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed by policemen on the Youtube"},{"startMs":2726140,"durationMs":7300,"subtitle":"that's bloody... that's enlightening, man, Paul Bernardo, he's like the CEO of a meeting in that video"},{"startMs":2733440,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"he gives the cops hell, he gives the lawyers hell, he protests his innocence, he basically tells them that they're rude and untrustworthy"},{"startMs":2740920,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"because they don't trust him, because he did a few little things seventeen years ago"},{"startMs":2745280,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"and he gets away with the few little things, right, I mean he killed a bunch of people, including the sister of his girlfriend at the time"},{"startMs":2752360,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender, and murderer"},{"startMs":2755800,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"but he basically goes: you know, that's a long time ago, it's like, we're past that, aren't we?"},{"startMs":2762000,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"I mean, I'm having a discussion with you, I'm trying to help you solve some crimes, which, by the way, I committed, but we won't bring that up"},{"startMs":2768340,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"you know, and you're accusing me of being a liar, you're not playing fair, what's up with you?"},{"startMs":2773680,"durationMs":5060,"subtitle":"and then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is, like, that's a lovely little manipulative thing"},{"startMs":2778740,"durationMs":7740,"subtitle":"'cause it basically means: whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than your foolish story"},{"startMs":2786480,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"and you watch, you'll see people do that to you, and then you get a little insight into what they're up to"},{"startMs":2790820,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"he's very good at that; or he looks outside, or he just looks at his hands, or he looks out the window"},{"startMs":2797100,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"immediately dismissive in his nonverbal behavior, it's brilliant"},{"startMs":2801340,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"the courts were forced to release that, by the way, look it up, Paul Bernardo on Youtube"},{"startMs":2807820,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"wow, it's jus mind-boggling, he's so good at what he does"},{"startMs":2812320,"durationMs":4060,"subtitle":"and he's good-looking, and he's charismatic, and, you know, he can really pull it off"},{"startMs":2816380,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"and you can't tell what's happening with the cops and the lawyers, whether they're just letting him play his routine to get some information from him"},{"startMs":2822920,"durationMs":4340,"subtitle":"or whether he's actually setting them back on his heels, and I suspect it's a bit of both"},{"startMs":2827260,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"but it's a masterful performance; if you didn't know who he was, and you were watching it without the audio"},{"startMs":2834140,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"you'd think he's the CEO of some company giving his employees hell for not being up to scratch"},{"startMs":2839660,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"that's all his body language, his eye contact, everything, just speaks that, it's amazing"},{"startMs":2845340,"durationMs":4940,"subtitle":"so anyways, you got these two-bit hoods here, who think they're really something"},{"startMs":2850280,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"and they also think they're tough and dangerous, and they're not, they're just, you know, cowardly corner dwellers"},{"startMs":2856880,"durationMs":7340,"subtitle":"and they confuse their unwillingness to abide by reasonable rules with an indication of their heroic courage"},{"startMs":2864220,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"which is something else that low-rent hoods like to do, you know"},{"startMs":2867440,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"and it's partly because lots of people who just attend to the law do do that because they're cowardly"},{"startMs":2872900,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"which is a Nietzschean observation, are you good? or are you just afraid?"},{"startMs":2876940,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"let's start with afraid first, before we proceed to good, and that the reason you follow the rules is that you're afraid of getting caught"},{"startMs":2884920,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"yeah, well, you know those kids who... often university kids who are in a hockey riot"},{"startMs":2891480,"durationMs":8700,"subtitle":"and breaking windows, and stealing things, you know, they get nailed for it, and afterwards they're really blown away by their own behavior"},{"startMs":2900180,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"it's like, well, they're in that camp, they think they are good people, but they're not, they're just never anywhere where you could be bad"},{"startMs":2906860,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and as soon as you put them somewhere, where they could be bad, it's like, out it comes, just like that"},{"startMs":2911600,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"and that's really worth thinking about, 'cause most of you, many of you, but not all of you, I suspect"},{"startMs":2919680,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"have never really been somewhere that you could be really bad and get away with it"},{"startMs":2924480,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"and so you might think, well, you wouldn't do it, but people do it, all the time"},{"startMs":2931060,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"so anyways, they're talking about some exploits, and"},{"startMs":2934480,"durationMs":5560,"subtitle":"then they see that this character named Stomboli, he has a puppet show, right"},{"startMs":2940040,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"and he's kind of a wheeler-dealer too"},{"startMs":2943280,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"remember, I showed you that mas that was glaring at Pinokio when he got his voice?"},{"startMs":2948880,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"it's like, Stromboli is one of his manifestations, the fox here is another one of his manifestations"},{"startMs":2955760,"durationMs":4360,"subtitle":"all the negative characters throughout the movie are manifestations of the same thing"},{"startMs":2960120,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"it's partly the adversarial individual, and it's partly the tyrrannical aspect of society"},{"startMs":2965260,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"it's the negative masculine, that's one way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":2968760,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"so, and you know, when men go bad, they often go bad by being antisocial and tyrrannical"},{"startMs":2973940,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"there's way more antisocial men than there antisocial women, which is why there's twenty times as many men in jail as there are women"},{"startMs":2980520,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"so each gender, let's say each sex has it's own characteristic pathologies"},{"startMs":2986640,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and there are some antisocial women, you know, and there are some high-neuroticism guys"},{"startMs":2991680,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"or some guys who are really agreeable as well, but they're rare"},{"startMs":2997600,"durationMs":7580,"subtitle":"so anyways, he sees this poster advertising Stromboli's puppet show"},{"startMs":3005180,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"so Stromboli's a puppet master; now that's really worth thinking about, because that's an archetypal theme"},{"startMs":3012800,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"or it's at least attached to an archetypal theme: something's behind the scenes, pulling the strings"},{"startMs":3019920,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"and everyone always wonders what that is, what's actually going on; what's actually going on with Trump?"},{"startMs":3025360,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"who's actually in control? is it Putin? I mean that's the fantasies of the left, it's Putin"},{"startMs":3032580,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"it's like, well, the question always is, what's going on behind the scene"},{"startMs":3038100,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"right, and the question is... that's the case certainly on the political landscape, business landscape, interpersonal relations"},{"startMs":3044640,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"what are you really up to, everyone's always wondering that, right, it's why they're watching you eyes"},{"startMs":3050000,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"'cause your eyes point at things, and they can infer what you're interested in, and what you're up to by looking at what you look at"},{"startMs":3057600,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"and that's why your eyes have whites, it's so that we can see where you're pointing them, 'cause gorillas don't"},{"startMs":3063620,"durationMs":7320,"subtitle":"and so what that means, roughly speaking, is that all of your ancestors whose eyes couldn't be reliably tracked"},{"startMs":3070940,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"were either killed or didn't mate, it's a big deal for us to see where people's eyes are pointed"},{"startMs":3077360,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"and so we're always watching each other's eyes, constantly; what are you up to, what are you up to?"},{"startMs":3081500,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"what are you looking at? what do you want?

well, if you look at Stromboli, you might be thinking:"},{"startMs":3129940,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"it's not clear he's someone you'd want to have pulling your strings"},{"startMs":3134240,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"there's a little bit of, forced ethusiasm, let's say, there, and he's just not a very savory looking character"},{"startMs":3141460,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"so anyways, the fox knows him, and they start talking about Stromboli, that old joker"},{"startMs":3148660,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"how they could possibly involve him in some sort of scam, because he's back in town"},{"startMs":3154040,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and then they see the puppet, and the fox does his equivalent of thinking"},{"startMs":3159720,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"which is, you know, pretty sad and nasty, but that's what he does"},{"startMs":3163880,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and then they see this puppet with no strings, and they think: hey man"},{"startMs":3167800,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"a puppet master would pay a lot for something that is capable of semi-autonomous movement like that"},{"startMs":3173880,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"it would be kind of a miracle; and so they decide that they would take him to Stromboli"},{"startMs":3178160,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"and so they grab him, and, hah, he's got an apple to take to the teacher, which, I think it's the cat, promptly eats"},{"startMs":3186960,"durationMs":9980,"subtitle":"and the fox acts out this false enthusiasm about what Pinokio is up to, and pretends that he's his friend"},{"startMs":3196940,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"which is of course what your typical pedophile will do, and so this is in the same kind of category"},{"startMs":3202160,"durationMs":6980,"subtitle":"and it truly is; one of the things that's interesting to know about pedophiles is that they're predatory, right"},{"startMs":3209140,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"and so they don't go after kids that are assertive and likely to be noisy"},{"startMs":3216340,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"they watch, and they watch to see if they can find a kid who's defeated, and..."},{"startMs":3222680,"durationMs":6700,"subtitle":"that's good enough, who's defeated, and who's gonna need a friend, and who's not going to object"},{"startMs":3229380,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and so when they check out... these are the ones who do the stranger abductions, which are, by the way, extraordinarily rare"},{"startMs":3234560,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"they look for a victim type, they look for a kid who's gonna be easy to take down"},{"startMs":3240020,"durationMs":4780,"subtitle":"and so, you know, that's one thing you don't want... so you might think, well..."},{"startMs":3244800,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"one of the things that was really big, it's probably even worse now, when I was a parent of young children"},{"startMs":3250560,"durationMs":8580,"subtitle":"was to teach your kids how to be afraid of strangers, it's like, uh, no, wrong, that is not what you teach them"},{"startMs":3259140,"durationMs":8100,"subtitle":"because all you do is teach them then to be timid and fearful, and the real predatory types, they're pretty much thrilled about that"},{"startMs":3267240,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"'cause you'll also make them sheltered and naive"},{"startMs":3271080,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"you make your kids courageous, and you get their damn eyes open, and that's the best thing you can do against people who are truly dangerous"},{"startMs":3278480,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"so, none of that terrifying... it's not a good idea"},{"startMs":3284680,"durationMs":8020,"subtitle":"anyways, the fox befriends the puppet, and then they come up with this evil scheme to get him off to Stromboli, the puppet master"},{"startMs":3292700,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and away they go, and they sing a little song about being an actor, \"an actor's life for me\""},{"startMs":3298380,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"this took me along time to figure out, I thought: they're taking Pinokio away to be an actor"},{"startMs":3304840,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"now why in the world are actors getting such a rough time in this movie?"},{"startMs":3309940,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"it's like, it's a Hollywood movie, you know, it's acting, obviously, the voiceovers and all of that are acting"},{"startMs":3316940,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"it's... why is this thing about being an actor?

I don't remember that horrible little guy [student: Cartman] yeah, that's him"},{"startMs":3472740,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"his mother brings in the dog whisperer to train him, and it's a brilliant episode"},{"startMs":3479020,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"if you want to learn about the freudian edipal situation, you watch that, you've got it down cold"},{"startMs":3484780,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"because she brings in this expert, who then she wants to have an affair with, so that's a boundary issue"},{"startMs":3489300,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"and he basically separates her son from him [sic], and imposes the same discipline on him, that he would impose on a bad dog"},{"startMs":3498020,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"although he also trains the dog's owners all the time, because maybe it's not the dog, maybe it's the owner"},{"startMs":3504300,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"there's a horse whisperer movie, too, about the original horse whisperer that does a beautiful job of laying that out, too"},{"startMs":3510040,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"'cause he's very good at fixing problem horses, and unbelivably good at diagnosing psychopathology on the part of the owner"},{"startMs":3517920,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"he's got a gift for it, but..."},{"startMs":3520440,"durationMs":7160,"subtitle":"anyways, what happens in the South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets Cartman straightened out"},{"startMs":3527600,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"and he starts, like, dressing properly, and doing his homework, and..."},{"startMs":3531220,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and the mother is pursuing an affair with the dog whisperer, but he's professional"},{"startMs":3535320,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"he keeps his distance, he keeps boundaries around him"},{"startMs":3538600,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"and then he leaves, and then the first thing that she does when he leaves"},{"startMs":3543040,"durationMs":7960,"subtitle":"is bribe Cartman, basically, out of doing his homework, so that he can accompany her to, I don't know, a fast food restaurant or something like that"},{"startMs":3551000,"durationMs":4580,"subtitle":"and so, the reason she does that is 'cause she's lonesome, and doesn't have anybody else around"},{"startMs":3555580,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"and, you know, maybe she's also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow up, he will leave"},{"startMs":3562620,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and she'll have nothing"},{"startMs":3564620,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"you know, and so, mothers who don't have something, say, outside their infants"},{"startMs":3569640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"not merely their children, are more likely to fall into that, and it's no wonder"},{"startMs":3573640,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"you know, you gotta think that through; and lots of women, most women, really fall in love with their babies"},{"startMs":3581040,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"and so, even if they start growing into larger children that can be threatening"},{"startMs":3585480,"durationMs":7540,"subtitle":"because when the child... when the infant turns into a toddler, the infant is dead"},{"startMs":3593020,"durationMs":7420,"subtitle":"the toddler is there now; and you can radically interfere with that process, that happens all the time"},{"startMs":3600440,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"that's the classic Freudian oedipal nightmare"},{"startMs":3603400,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"and that episode is brilliant, it's bloody brilliant, it just nails it"},{"startMs":3607480,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"some of you've been in my personality class and watched \"Crumb\", the documentary \"Crumb\""},{"startMs":3612000,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"and that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology"},{"startMs":3617240,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"anyways, one of the things Jung pointed out..."},{"startMs":3620520,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"so I knew this guys once, who had a mother who basically was trying that trick"},{"startMs":3625720,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"and she was very smart, and had lots of tricks up her sleeves, and there was just no way he was gonna go for it"},{"startMs":3631560,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"he rebelled at every possible moment, and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response"},{"startMs":3637400,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop when they're raised by single mothers"},{"startMs":3643940,"durationMs":2200,"subtitle":"'cause they tend to go one of two ways"},{"startMs":3646140,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"and he just fought her at every step of the way, and it didn't happen"},{"startMs":3650300,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"but one of the things Jung said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the \"Crumb\" documentary"},{"startMs":3655400,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"is that the oedipal mother basically entices the child, she says: look"},{"startMs":3660380,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"here's the deal, you don't have to do anything, but you don't get to leave"},{"startMs":3665960,"durationMs":4300,"subtitle":"and if you don't leave, and you don't to these difficult things, then I'll take care of you"},{"startMs":3670260,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"and the child has a choice, all the way along there, I mean, obviously he's outclassed in some sense, but it's not as obvious as you'd think"},{"startMs":3677280,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"little kids are tough, and they make decisions all the time"},{"startMs":3680720,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"and so Jung thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother"},{"startMs":3686120,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"and I really like that, it's actually a conspiracy between mother, father, and child, actually"},{"startMs":3690640,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"and I think that's a good way of looking at it, even though it's really rough, 'cause"},{"startMs":3694140,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"well, should you hold the child responsible? well, yes, but judiciously, and not completely"},{"startMs":3700560,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"'cause then if you deal with someone like that as an adult, and they're trying to escape from it"},{"startMs":3705220,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell it happened"},{"startMs":3709140,"durationMs":5420,"subtitle":"they have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in"},{"startMs":3714560,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"'cause they can't come in unless you invite them in, so don't invite them in"},{"startMs":3718880,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"'cause once they're in they're really hard to get rid of, and they'll take all your blood"},{"startMs":3723520,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"so that's a cautionary tale"},{"startMs":3726000,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"so anyways, Pinokio doesn't know any better, and he's got the egotism of youth"},{"startMs":3731380,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"he's offered the easy way to success, which is exactly what the fox tells him, and off they go to see Stromboli"},{"startMs":3737860,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"so this is this song, I'm not gonna read it all"},{"startMs":3742300,"durationMs":5780,"subtitle":"it's great to be a celebrity, an actor's life for me"},{"startMs":3748080,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"you sleep till after two you promenade a big cigar you tour the world in a private car"},{"startMs":3754280,"durationMs":3160,"subtitle":"you dine on chicken and caviar an actor's life for me!"},{"startMs":3757440,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"it's all this idea of wealth and public exposure"},{"startMs":3761640,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning"},{"startMs":3767620,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"and so it's a dual attraction, right, you get everything you want, and you don't have to do anything"},{"startMs":3772840,"durationMs":5300,"subtitle":"geez, what a deal; and so that's what the actor represents, it's a liar, fundamentally"},{"startMs":3778140,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"it's someone who's acting out a deception, they're a persona in the Jungian sense"},{"startMs":3783740,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"so the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are. but you're not"},{"startMs":3791140,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"it's this mask, and that's the actor, that's the persona"},{"startMs":3794360,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"so the fox and the cat are inviting the puppet to only become a persona"},{"startMs":3800320,"durationMs":10160,"subtitle":"see, for Jung, you start as a persona, and then, when you start to investigate the parts of you that don't really fit in that persona"},{"startMs":3810480,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"and that would be the shadow, then you start understanding who you really are"},{"startMs":3814280,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"and that's shocking, because the persona contains everything, roughly speaking, that you think is good"},{"startMs":3820240,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"and maybe even that your immediate culture thinks is good"},{"startMs":3823200,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"and then the shadow contains everything's that's not part of that"},{"startMs":3826140,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"and some of that's really bad, but some of it is good disguised as bad"},{"startMs":3832100,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"and you can't break out of the persona and transcend it until you incorporate a lot of what's in the shadow"},{"startMs":3838220,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"and so, for example, it you're and extrordinarily compassionate person, let's say 98th percentile"},{"startMs":3844180,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"you're going to be sacrificing yourself to other people all the time"},{"startMs":3848440,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and there are people who will find that extraordinarily endearing"},{"startMs":3852160,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"and it will be, under some circumstances, but the problem is that you will sacrifice yourself"},{"startMs":3857560,"durationMs":3980,"subtitle":"and that's a really bad attitude to have, for example, towards adult males"},{"startMs":3861540,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"it's a great thing for infants, but for adult males it is *the* wrong approach"},{"startMs":3865440,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"you will get taken advantage of continually by people who are looking for someone like you, until you grow some teeth"},{"startMs":3873040,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"and you'll think: no, no, that's the opposite of compassion, being able to bite hard is the opposite of compassion"},{"startMs":3880640,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"which it is; and so you'll have that pushed into the predator category"},{"startMs":3885060,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"\"I'm not doing that, I'm not getting angry, I don't like conflict\""},{"startMs":3888300,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"until you bring that out of the depths and put it on, so you can use it, you're gonna be in trouble"},{"startMs":3895160,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"and that's kinda Nietzsche's idea of the revaluation of good and evil"},{"startMs":3898700,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"you have a sense of what's good, and a sense of what isn't with your conscience, but it's not very smart"},{"startMs":3904580,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"it's got things in the wrong boxes, even nature itself"},{"startMs":3908860,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"a lot of the things that you accept as untrammeled goods, like compassion, let's say"},{"startMs":3914040,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"have a very dark side, first of all, and second, are not enough to get you through life"},{"startMs":3919440,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"you need the opposite virtues, too, and so you have to develop them"},{"startMs":3923340,"durationMs":4220,"subtitle":"you get outside the persona to do that"},{"startMs":3927560,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"but anyways, Pinokio's invited to be a false persona to take the gains of celebrity"},{"startMs":3934400,"durationMs":5340,"subtitle":"without having to do anything to be educated, he's just gonna go right to the top from right where he is"},{"startMs":3939740,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"and you know, people are kinda fascinated by that idea, that's why you watch America's Got Talent"},{"startMs":3945680,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"or the X-Factor, which shows I actually love, by the way"},{"startMs":3949160,"durationMs":8820,"subtitle":"you never see narcissism in its purer forms than you see it when you watch people who display an absolute lack of talent"},{"startMs":3957980,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"and become homicidal when someone dares point it out"},{"startMs":3961480,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"accusatory and homicidal, instantly, it's really something"},{"startMs":3966060,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"and then, now and then, you do see one of these people who's so introverted, and so out of society"},{"startMs":3972460,"durationMs":4540,"subtitle":"and have this unbelievable gift, which is also something really remarkable to see"},{"startMs":3977000,"durationMs":6580,"subtitle":"and it's no wonder these things are so popular, they're psychologically extraordinarily interesting"},{"startMs":3983580,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"so that's the actor, first of Pinokio's temptations, and of course it's the first one, because he's entering the social world"},{"startMs":3990660,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"and the temptation in the social world is to be exactly what other people want you to be"},{"startMs":3995400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and the thing that's cool about that is that is what you should be doing"},{"startMs":3999000,"durationMs":7880,"subtitle":"when you go out in your peers, you should be not subjugating your individuality to your peers, 'cause that's not exactly right"},{"startMs":4006880,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"that's kinda based on an inhibition model, you've got aggression, you've got bad habits, they have to be inhibited"},{"startMs":4012620,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"you learn that by interacting with your peers; it's not the right model, that's a Freudian model"},{"startMs":4018300,"durationMs":4860,"subtitle":"Piaget was correct about that, he basically pointed out that what should happen is"},{"startMs":4023160,"durationMs":5140,"subtitle":"let's say, with your aggression, and hopefully you have some, is that it gets socialized"},{"startMs":4028300,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"you learn how to play games, but you don't drop your drive to win, you integrate that in the games"},{"startMs":4034160,"durationMs":6740,"subtitle":"you try to win, you try to play hard, but if you're defeated or you hit something negative, you don't respond negatively"},{"startMs":4040900,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"and you can keep that all bounded within being a good player, a fair player"},{"startMs":4046400,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and that means what's happened is you learned how to play a game or a set of games"},{"startMs":4051580,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"that also includes the darker parts of you, and they actually become part of your force of character"},{"startMs":4057100,"durationMs":4820,"subtitle":"it's way better if you can pull that off, and that's what you definitely wanna do as an adult"},{"startMs":4061920,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"all you people are gonna have to learn to negotiate on your own behalf, and that's really hard"},{"startMs":4067660,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"it means that you have to know what you want, you have to be able to communicate it, and you have to be able to say \"no\""},{"startMs":4074600,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"and to say \"no\" you have to be built on a solid foundation, you have to have options"},{"startMs":4079960,"durationMs":2660,"subtitle":"so you gotta remember that as you go through your life"},{"startMs":4082620,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"if you don't have options, you can't negotiate with someone, and if you're not willing to use them, they win, period"},{"startMs":4088480,"durationMs":5660,"subtitle":"because if you're asking your boss for more money, say, the answer is no"},{"startMs":4094140,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"because he doesn't have any spare money lying around that he can just give to you, and lots of other people are asking"},{"startMs":4100560,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"so some of that zero-sum stuff, not all of it, because often you cooperate with people, and the whole pot can grow"},{"startMs":4107120,"durationMs":4220,"subtitle":"but some of it's zero-sum, and so you better have a case made"},{"startMs":4111340,"durationMs":7900,"subtitle":"\"here's how much money I should have, here's why, here's the benefit to you if you do it"},{"startMs":4119240,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"here's the consequences if you don't, they're actually real, they will cost you, and I will do them\""},{"startMs":4125600,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"then you can negotiate, and you don't do that rudely, but those arguments, you better have them in order"},{"startMs":4131900,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"for example, if you're gonna negotiate for a raise or a status shift"},{"startMs":4136580,"durationMs":7020,"subtitle":"you better have your resume at hand, all polished up, and know where else you're gonna look for a job, and you better be able to get one"},{"startMs":4143600,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"'cause otherwise you're weak, and you will not win the negotiation"},{"startMs":4147980,"durationMs":6620,"subtitle":"and if you're too agreeable, so your conflict-avoidant, you will make less money across time"},{"startMs":4154600,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"that's already been well established, and that's because you don't have teeth, not enough"},{"startMs":4160300,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"and so, in the little micro-contest that you're going to have every day"},{"startMs":4165100,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"you're going to incrementally lose to people who are more aggressive"},{"startMs":4169200,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"who have bigger teeth, and that's what happens, so don't let that happen"},{"startMs":4176420,"durationMs":7220,"subtitle":"you place yourselves so you can negotiate, 'cause otherwise you're just a facade"},{"startMs":4183640,"durationMs":8940,"subtitle":"and in a real battle a facade is just torn down right away"},{"startMs":4192580,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"well, the cricket, he's supposed to be helping the puppet out, but he overslept"},{"startMs":4199540,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"that's just another indication that he's not everything he could be yet, and that's really..."},{"startMs":4205520,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"that took me a long time to puzzle out with regards to interpreting this movie"},{"startMs":4208860,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"I could not figure out, I told you this, if the bug is the person who opens the hero narrative"},{"startMs":4215140,"durationMs":5580,"subtitle":"and who can guide the transformations of time and who has the same initials as Jesus Chris"},{"startMs":4220720,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"and is knighted by nature herself, why is he such an idiot?"},{"startMs":4224820,"durationMs":6340,"subtitle":"it's a very difficult thing to figure out, but the idea that the conscience isn't omniscient"},{"startMs":4231160,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"even though it has that voice of, let's say, common sense"},{"startMs":4235300,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"and that fits very nicely in with the Freudian idea of the superego, again, because the superego can be flawed"},{"startMs":4241980,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"it can be too harsh, it can not be properly developed"},{"startMs":4245880,"durationMs":7400,"subtitle":"you see that often with people who are orderly, so they're high in conscientiousness, conscientiousness fragments into industriousness and orderliness"},{"startMs":4253280,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"orderly people like willpower, they're very judgmental, and they like things to be exactly where they're supposed to be"},{"startMs":4259280,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"but they're also very self-punitive; conservatives are much more likely to be orderly, by the way"},{"startMs":4265440,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"it's one of the best predictors of conservatism; low openness is the best predictor, but right after that is high orderliness"},{"startMs":4272820,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"and it's associated with disgust sensitivity, which is really an amazing thing, we'll talk about that later"},{"startMs":4280820,"durationMs":5500,"subtitle":"anyways, the cricket, he falls down his first day on the job"},{"startMs":4286320,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"he's not as conscientious a conscience as he should be"},{"startMs":4293140,"durationMs":6500,"subtitle":"so he's feeling pretty stupid, he's got his little millionaire clothes on, but he's really not living up to them"},{"startMs":4299640,"durationMs":8920,"subtitle":"he does catch up to the fox and the puppet, however, and tries to dissuade Pinokio from going down this road"},{"startMs":4308560,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"and of course, the cat, well, you can see what the cat's doing there, he's got a big hammer"},{"startMs":4314020,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"big mallet, and he's... it also shows you just exactly how much of a clue he has"},{"startMs":4319380,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"he's gonna wallop the bug who's sitting on the fox's hat, which I think he actually does"},{"startMs":4324120,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"then the fox can't get out of his hat, and has to talk through his hat, which basically he's doing all the time anyways"},{"startMs":4330640,"durationMs":8700,"subtitle":"so, this I really like, you see on the left here that the cricket is speaking inside this flower"},{"startMs":4339340,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and like I said, there's nothing accidental in these representations"},{"startMs":4344620,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"these are artists who were coming up with these compositions, and their fantasy has a structure"},{"startMs":4350020,"durationMs":7420,"subtitle":"so the cricket is speaking out of this flower that has, well, you could think about it as... it has a sexualized element"},{"startMs":4357440,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"so you could think about that as a phallic part, and that part of the feminine part of it, they are flowers, after all"},{"startMs":4363420,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"they are the sex organs of plants, and that's very much the same over here, this is the yoni and lingam"},{"startMs":4370700,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"this is from Hindu culture, and you see there's a snake wrapped around that, so that's masculine and feminine"},{"startMs":4378220,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"with a snake wrapped around it, and that's a holy representation, a sacred representation"},{"startMs":4384080,"durationMs":5220,"subtitle":"and it represents the deepst reality, that's one way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":4389300,"durationMs":4140,"subtitle":"like chaos and order, surrounded by the snake, it's exactly the same idea"},{"startMs":4393440,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"so the cricket speaks out of that; well we already know that, 'cause it is the conscience"},{"startMs":4398960,"durationMs":7200,"subtitle":"and he's been awakened in part by Gepetto and the good father, and awakened in part by the good fairy and nature"},{"startMs":4406160,"durationMs":7620,"subtitle":"so he speaks with those voices, and he's also a manifestation of the underlying chaos itself"},{"startMs":4413780,"durationMs":3140,"subtitle":"because nature and culture spring out of chaos"},{"startMs":4416920,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"I already showed you that schematic representation"},{"startMs":4421720,"durationMs":6520,"subtitle":"I'll just end this scene, and then we'll have a 15-minute break, okay?"},{"startMs":4428240,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"anyways, the cricket tires to make a case for why Pinokio shouldn't go off to be a celebrity"},{"startMs":4434920,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"but, you know, it's a hard case to make, because the fox is very manipulative, and Pinokio is naive"},{"startMs":4442600,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"and it sounds like a good offer, and also the fox is actually quite forceful, he basically takes him by the hand"},{"startMs":4448580,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"so the temptation is, and this is something else I like about the movie"},{"startMs":4453340,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"you can't just say: \"well, the puppet gets what he deserves\""},{"startMs":4456800,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"'cause he's little and naive, and what he's facing is really malevolent, truly malevolent"},{"startMs":4463160,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"and physically overpowering, and so the movie does a nice job of not minimizing the threat that's posed by this particular temptation"},{"startMs":4471320,"durationMs":2860,"subtitle":"and that's part of what makes it art"},{"startMs":4474180,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"so we'll stop there, we'll have a break for 15 minutes, and then we'll start with the stage"},{"startMs":4480380,"durationMs":7160,"subtitle":"alright, so here we are, at the big event, and Pinokio is off to be a celebrity"},{"startMs":4487540,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"and the cricket is watching, and Pinokio basically..."},{"startMs":4495220,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"well, he's got some natural talent, because he's a puppet, but he doesn't have strings"},{"startMs":4500100,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"he goes on stage with strings, and then he drops his strings, and the whole crowd is amazed"},{"startMs":4505020,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and the crowd should be amazed when that happens; you can imagine when a kid goes to school"},{"startMs":4510300,"durationMs":9100,"subtitle":"and shows some independence, that that's actually gonna... people are gonna notice that"},{"startMs":4519400,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"his peers are gonna notice that, the teachers are gonna notice that"},{"startMs":4523000,"durationMs":4740,"subtitle":"maybe it's too much independence even, but it's still a... it is a remarkable thing, too"},{"startMs":4527740,"durationMs":7720,"subtitle":"it's so interesting, you can see marked signs of independence in children, well, right from the time they're born, basically"},{"startMs":4535460,"durationMs":5700,"subtitle":"because one of the things that's really funny about the infants, is when they're crying, you always think:"},{"startMs":4541160,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"\"oh, the baby's sad\", it's like, no, a lot of the time that baby is angry"},{"startMs":4547800,"durationMs":8520,"subtitle":"and the way that we know that is because you can do facial expression coding on infants, just like on adults"},{"startMs":4556320,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"and you can tell what emotion they're expressing, and very frequently..."},{"startMs":4559740,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"like when a kid starts to recognize his mom explicitly"},{"startMs":4563780,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"'cause he or she knows the smell right away, pretty much, and the sound of the voice, but visually"},{"startMs":4568760,"durationMs":6540,"subtitle":"if someone comes in and it isn't who the baby wants, so generally it isn't mom"},{"startMs":4575300,"durationMs":6460,"subtitle":"the baby will start to cry, but it's not 'cause the baby's sad, generally, it's because it's angry that mom didn't show up"},{"startMs":4581760,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"and that's an early sign of will, it's like this kid wants things"},{"startMs":4586180,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"and it's perfectly willing to tell you about"},{"startMs":4589800,"durationMs":4460,"subtitle":"and of course a two-year-old who's having a temper tantrum is in some sense doing the same thing"},{"startMs":4594260,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"it's poorly integrated will and independence, obviously, but it certainly runs contrary to what you want"},{"startMs":4600220,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"you don't want your two-year-old having a temper tantrum in the middle of the toy store"},{"startMs":4603860,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"it's extraordinarily embarrassing for you and... well, for you, but it's also embarrassing for the two-year-old"},{"startMs":4610160,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"this is one of the reasons I think that that sort of thing should be carefully socialized rapidly"},{"startMs":4616040,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"because it's actually humiliating for the kid, 'cause other people don't like that"},{"startMs":4619880,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and they're very judgmental about it, they won't say anything, usually, but sometimes they will"},{"startMs":4624440,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"but they're not happy about the fact that that's happening, and they will judge the child negatively"},{"startMs":4629360,"durationMs":6940,"subtitle":"so you don't want your child to be behaving in a way in public that makes other people think badly of them"},{"startMs":4636300,"durationMs":9460,"subtitle":"it's really, really not good, and so part of your job as a parent is to not expose your child to that sort of experience"},{"startMs":4645760,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"especially not repeatedly, it's really hard on them"},{"startMs":4649280,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"or they get narcissistic, which is also rally hard on them"},{"startMs":4652820,"durationMs":2600,"subtitle":"it just takes a lot longer to manifest itself"},{"startMs":4655420,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"so anyways, he's off on stage and Stromboli introduces him and talks about how wonderful this is going to be"},{"startMs":4661680,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and Pinokio comes out on stage with the strings on, and drops them"},{"startMs":4665600,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"and then he falls down the steps and puts his nose into a hole, makes a fool out of himself"},{"startMs":4669140,"durationMs":7820,"subtitle":"and that's the first time Stromboli shows his true character, 'cause he just really yells and screams at him"},{"startMs":4676960,"durationMs":6300,"subtitle":"and he has his back to the audience, Stromboli, while he's doing this, so he's not noticing how the audience is reacting"},{"startMs":4683260,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"typical tyrannical parent, right, who's not noticing that society is reacting a different way than him"},{"startMs":4689860,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"he's not happy about it, and Pinokio of course is dazed and feels like a fool, and he is a fool"},{"startMs":4695320,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"so that's appropriate; but then Stromboli hears the crowd laughing, and as soon as he turns around he's all smiles again"},{"startMs":4703300,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"so that's the first time you get insight into what sort of puppet master he is"},{"startMs":4707780,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"he's there to please the crowd and that's all, and he's there to look good in public, but fundamentally he's a tyrant"},{"startMs":4713020,"durationMs":7980,"subtitle":"and I guess that's the problem with false celebrity, that the negative spirit of the crowd becomes your master"},{"startMs":4721000,"durationMs":6900,"subtitle":"because to be a celebrity, you have to be a crowd pleaser, and if you're pleasing the kind of crowd who likes a celebrity like you"},{"startMs":4727900,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"which is... and there's not much reason for that, then it's not exactly like you're appealing to the proper side of the crowd"},{"startMs":4736620,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and you've become its puppet one way or another, and maybe it's rewarding you with wealth, perhaps"},{"startMs":4741580,"durationMs":7360,"subtitle":"and with attention, but fundamentally it's not something I would recommend"},{"startMs":4748940,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"if you want to stay reasonably psychologically healthy for any reasonable amount of time; you're gonna sell yourself out"},{"startMs":4755020,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"and I don't mean that in any casual way, you know"},{"startMs":4759580,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"all right, so anyways, Stromboli changes from the tyrant to the good father in half a second"},{"startMs":4765520,"durationMs":4700,"subtitle":"he gives Pinokio a pat on the head despite the fact that he's made a mistake, looks all kind"},{"startMs":4770220,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"and the show continues; now, the cricket is not very happy about this"},{"startMs":4774640,"durationMs":6280,"subtitle":"he's sitting in the stage, watching, he's very angry and, let's say, disgusted by what's happening"},{"startMs":4780920,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"partly because Pinokio is making a fool of himself; now that's an interesting thing"},{"startMs":4785960,"durationMs":8380,"subtitle":"human beings blush, in fact, if I remember correctly, the name Adam, you know, like Adam and Eve"},{"startMs":4794340,"durationMs":6260,"subtitle":"is related to the capacity to blush; now that comes from something I read a long time ago, and that might be wrong"},{"startMs":4800600,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"but Adam does manifest shame in the sight of God, so there is a relationship there"},{"startMs":4806420,"durationMs":5820,"subtitle":"but anyways, people do make foold of themselves for public display"},{"startMs":4812240,"durationMs":4200,"subtitle":"and you can tell you've done that in some sense, not always, if you blush"},{"startMs":4816440,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"because you've either said something you shoulnd't've and you realize that"},{"startMs":4821760,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"which is more like you've tried to be funny and gone a little bit too far, and sometimes that can be really funny"},{"startMs":4827200,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"or you've said something you know to be false, manipulative, deceitful, beneath you"},{"startMs":4834580,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"any of those things, and you'll have an automatic response to it, you'll be ashamed and blush"},{"startMs":4839580,"durationMs":7300,"subtitle":"one theory about that is you can trust people who blush, because you know that their conscience will betray them"},{"startMs":4846880,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"and so that even if they are lying, they tell you; it's an interesting theory"},{"startMs":4851640,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"because blush is definitely... like it's a facial display, it's right out there, where people can see it"},{"startMs":4857580,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"you know, maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but it's kind of an interesting idea"},{"startMs":4862080,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"anyways, the cricket is not happy with what's going on, he's not happy about Stromboli"},{"startMs":4865800,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"and he's not happy about the willingness of Pinokio to make a fool of himself to support this false celebrity"},{"startMs":4872680,"durationMs":8280,"subtitle":"I actually think that's why celebrity types like that often get narcissistic and arrogant"},{"startMs":4880960,"durationMs":8880,"subtitle":"it's because they aren't paying attention really to what's happening inside them, they drown it out"},{"startMs":4889840,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"because the glory and the money, and all that is so attractive and enticing"},{"startMs":4895360,"durationMs":3580,"subtitle":"they refuse to notice what price they're paying for it"},{"startMs":4898940,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and they magnify up their grandiosity and their arrogance to keep that stuff all under control"},{"startMs":4903900,"durationMs":3720,"subtitle":"and then of course they get surrounded by sycophants, which is a really bad thing"},{"startMs":4907620,"durationMs":4900,"subtitle":"they get surrounded by people who will tell them exactly what they wanna hear"},{"startMs":4912520,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"and that's really bad if what you wanna hear from other people is not good for you"},{"startMs":4916440,"durationMs":7660,"subtitle":"to surround yourself with people who won't offer you genuine criticism, or even genuine reward, it's the same
