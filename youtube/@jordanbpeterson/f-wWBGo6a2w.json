that"},{"startMs":404960,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"there's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience, that we don't know about reality."},{"startMs":411940,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"And we have our articulated representations of the world, and then you can think of outside of that: there are things we know absolutely nothing about."},{"startMs":419940,"durationMs":1980,"subtitle":"And there's a buffer between them."},{"startMs":421920,"durationMs":2680,"subtitle":"And those are things we sort of know something

arguing with someone close to you and they're in a bad mood, you know?"},{"startMs":432840,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"And they're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up."},{"startMs":438060,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"And maybe all of the sudden they get angry, or maybe they cry."},{"startMs":441760,"durationMs":6860,"subtitle":"And then when they cry, they figure out what they're angry about and it has nothing to do with you, even though you might have been what precipitated the argument."},{"startMs":448980,"durationMs":8760,"subtitle":"And that's an interesting phenomena as far as I'm concerned, because it means that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they know at another."},{"startMs":457940,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"So in some sense, the thoughts rise up from the body, and they do that in moods, and they do that in images, and they do that in actions."},{"startMs":465340,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner."},{"startMs":472480,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"So we have this articulated space that we can all discuss and then outside of that we have something that is more akin to a dream that we're embedded in."},{"startMs":480400,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"It's an emotional dream that we're embedded in."},{"startMs":483040,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"That's based, at least in part, on our actions, I'll describe that later."},{"startMs":486560,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"And then outside of that is what we don't know anything about at all."},{"startMs":490000,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"And in that dream, that's where the mystics live, and that's where the artists live."},{"startMs":494600,"durationMs":4980,"subtitle":"And they're the mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure."},{"startMs":502100,"durationMs":8380,"subtitle":"You see, what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don't really understand."},{"startMs":510480,"durationMs":6220,"subtitle":"And that if those two things are out of sync, so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream,"},{"startMs":516740,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"then we become dissociated internally."},{"startMs":520080,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"We think things we don't act out and we act out things we don't dream."},{"startMs":524320,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"And that produces a kind of sickness of the spirit."},{"startMs":527780,"durationMs":10020,"subtitle":"And that sickness of the spirit, its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation."},{"startMs":538140,"durationMs":6060,"subtitle":"And then people turn to things like ideologies, which I regard as parasites on an underlying religious substructure"},{"startMs":544200,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"to try to organize their thinking, and then that's a catastrophe."},{"startMs":547700,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"And that's what Nietzsche foresaw."},{"startMs":550040,"durationMs":9380,"subtitle":"You see, he knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization by destroying this representation, this \"god ideal,\" let's say,"},{"startMs":559800,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"that we would destabilize and move back and forth violently between nihilism and the extremes of ideology."},{"startMs":566480,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"He was particularly concerned about radical left ideology."},{"startMs":570640,"durationMs":7380,"subtitle":"He believed and predicted this

situation of the modern Western person and increasingly, of people in general."},{"startMs":609560,"durationMs":8740,"subtitle":"You know, I think part of the reason that Islam has its back up, with

they, being still grounded in a dream, let's say, they can see that the rootless questioning mind of the West poses a tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture."},{"startMs":632740,"durationMs":6840,"subtitle":"And it does, I mean, Westerners, us, we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching

it."},{"startMs":646940,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"But it's still a sort of fruitful catastrophe."},{"startMs":652600,"durationMs":3500,"subtitle":"And it has real effects on people's lives."},{"startMs":656120,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"It's not some abstract thing."},{"startMs":658800,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"Lots of times, when I've been treating people with depression,

psychopathology,"},{"startMs":759580,"durationMs":9900,"subtitle":"and that's this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies, which I really do think of, they're like crippled religions,

anything more important that needs to be done that."},{"startMs":797220,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"I've thought that for a long, long

that human beings were going to have to create their own values, essentially."},{"startMs":887840,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"Now he understood that we understood that we have bodies and we have motivations and emotions."},{"startMs":891800,"durationMs":11080,"subtitle":"Like, he was a romantic thinker, in some sense, but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't

body."},{"startMs":906900,"durationMs":900,"subtitle":"He understood that."},{"startMs":908000,"durationMs":10340,"subtitle":"But he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would

beautiful."},{"startMs":7536160,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"And a great work of literature and a great work of poetry."},{"startMs":7539540,"durationMs":14160,"subtitle":"And I'm wondering, just
