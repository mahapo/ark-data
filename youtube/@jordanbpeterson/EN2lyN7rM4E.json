why, you could formulate a story about it"},{"startMs":315140,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"but the probability that, that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero, because"},{"startMs":321640,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"you have to react way faster than that, and so, you know have social knowledge"},{"startMs":326760,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"built into your nervous system because you have practiced being a social being for a very long period of time"},{"startMs":333160,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"and of course, then that social being has been shaped forever really, it's the right way of thinking about it"},{"startMs":340160,"durationMs":4260,"subtitle":"Now, we know that animals organized themselves into hierarchies"},{"startMs":344420,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and we will say of dominance, because it is more true the farther back you go in time"},{"startMs":349680,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"at least since the time of the crustaceans, you know , when we split from out common ancestor 300 million years ago, and so"},{"startMs":356680,"durationMs":3220,"subtitle":"and it's true for social animals and non-social animals so"},{"startMs":359980,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"even animals that don't live together in groups"},{"startMs":363180,"durationMs":2820,"subtitle":"have to organize

time"},{"startMs":371240,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"partly that's, you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they are singing because basically what they are singing is"},{"startMs":378240,"durationMs":5740,"subtitle":"I am pretty damn healthy and I am ready to go and if you are another bird like me you had better steer clear of this tree!"},{"startMs":384380,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"and, the dominance songbirds"},{"startMs":387580,"durationMs":4380,"subtitle":"you know, they don't live together, crows are social but don't most songbirds aren't"},{"startMs":392580,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"the dominance songbirds get the best nest"},{"startMs":395540,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and the best nest is the one that

the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates, and"},{"startMs":407520,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"like it is really important where you are positioned in the hierarchy even if you are not"},{"startMs":411460,"durationMs":5080,"subtitle":"like a flock or a herd creature, now, we are more like herd creatures so it's even more"},{"startMs":416560,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"it's even more relevant to us , but there is just no escaping"},{"startMs":420920,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"a hierarchical arrangement in social being"},{"startMs":425060,"durationMs":1620,"subtitle":"that is social being"},{"startMs":427180,"durationMs":5460,"subtitle":"and, and, and it is evolutionary ancient beyond conception so"},{"startMs":432640,"durationMs":6760,"subtitle":"300 million years ago there weren't trees, you know I mean, so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees"},{"startMs":439400,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"so that is really something to think about and then, you know, when you are thinking about the reality that shaped us"},{"startMs":444660,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"say, from an evolutionary perspective but also from a cultural perspective"},{"startMs":450180,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"what you have to understand is that that the things that have shaped us most are the things that have been around the longest, and so you could say"},{"startMs":457320,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"those are the most real things"},{"startMs":459720,"durationMs":5100,"subtitle":"and you can't even see some of them, it's not like you can come in here and, well it's not exactly true"},{"startMs":464820,"durationMs":3900,"subtitle":"you can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at work"},{"startMs":468720,"durationMs":1620,"subtitle":"You can in a way, because,"},{"startMs":470460,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"the chairs are set up to face this way and I am facing that way and"},{"startMs":474620,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"that gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues instantly, right"},{"startMs":479640,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"you come down, you sit in the chairs, you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation and that's part of your procedural knowledge"},{"startMs":487640,"durationMs":2340,"subtitle":"about how to behave as a social creature"},{"startMs":490400,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"now,"},{"startMs":490980,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"that knowledge is really really deep and a lot of it is coded in your behaviour"},{"startMs":496100,"durationMs":2380,"subtitle":"now, and in other peoples behaviour as well"},{"startMs":498480,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"and that's, you know. that's the expectations you have of other people and of yourself, and a lot of those are implicit right,"},{"startMs":505280,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"so,"},{"startMs":505780,"durationMs":5980,"subtitle":"when we are interacting there's, there is a very large number of things that you just don't get to do"},{"startMs":511960,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"and you know that too, and you won't do them, and that way we can act as if we understand each other"},{"startMs":517640,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"even though we don't, because you are really complicated"},{"startMs":520880,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and I am really complicated and there is lots of situations where we might really be in conflict"},{"startMs":526220,"durationMs":5020,"subtitle":"but because we share a map of the culture, the cultural expectations"},{"startMs":531260,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"it makes part of our, it's built right into our perception"},{"startMs":534860,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"you will act out that set of expectations and so will I"},{"startMs":538800,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"and if neither of us can do that, even if one of us can't we are going to stay, we are either going immediately"},{"startMs":545000,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"devolve into conflict or we are going to avoid each other like the plague"},{"startMs":548940,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"and that's exactly the right thing to do,"},{"startMs":550860,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"and so, one of the really useful things to understand , and this took me a long time to formulate properly, you know,"},{"startMs":557280,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"you hear the terror management theorists for example and they have this idea that"},{"startMs":561160,"durationMs":4660,"subtitle":"your, your meaning representation, the story you tell about the world"},{"startMs":565980,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"regulates your death anxiety, it's something like that"},{"startMs":569740,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"but that is not right, I mean it is close to right and it is a smart idea"},{"startMs":573300,"durationMs":5960,"subtitle":"it came from Ernest Becker by the way who wrote a book called \"The Denial of Death\", which is actually quite a good book even though it is wrong"},{"startMs":579260,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"you know, sometimes a book can be very useful"},{"startMs":583280,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"it can be usefully wrong, and Becker's book is usefully wrong"},{"startMs":587700,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"because he thought that"},{"startMs":589520,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"it's the internal representation of your belief system"},{"startMs":593360,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"that regulates your anxiety and that anxiety is fundamentally"},{"startMs":597560,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"in the final analysis anxiety about death, it's like well, OK, fine, it is a reasonable"},{"startMs":603720,"durationMs":2940,"subtitle":"proposition, but that isn't how it works, you see,"},{"startMs":606800,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"it isn't my beliefs that right now that are regulating my emotion"},{"startMs":610920,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"It is the fact that I'm acting out those beliefs, which include implicit perceptions, I'm acting them out"},{"startMs":618140,"durationMs":1180,"subtitle":"and so are you"},{"startMs":619400,"durationMs":6800,"subtitle":"and so, what you're doing and what I expect, more accurately, what you're doing and what I want you to do"},{"startMs":626260,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and the way I want you to react to me, that's working!"},{"startMs":629700,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"so it's the match between my belief system and the way that everyone else is acting that is regulating my emotions"},{"startMs":637000,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"it's not the belief system"},{"startMs":638760,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"it's mediated by the social culture and you see if you understand this then"},{"startMs":642920,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"you understand more particularly why people"},{"startMs":645960,"durationMs":3260,"subtitle":"are willing to fight to the bitter end to protect their culture"},{"startMs":649220,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"it's not a psychological structure that they are protecting"},{"startMs":652780,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"it's a psychological structure and sociological structure, simultaneously"},{"startMs":658060,"durationMs":1980,"subtitle":"so the social contract is"},{"startMs":660040,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"you have a set of expectations and I have a set of expectations"},{"startMs":663720,"durationMs":3740,"subtitle":"they are actually desires, they are not merely expectations because as"},{"startMs":667460,"durationMs":3400,"subtitle":"living creatures we are desirous, we don't just expect"},{"startMs":670940,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"and so you desire an outcome and I desire an outcome"},{"startMs":674440,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"and we agree to act in accordance with that"},{"startMs":677680,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"that's the social contract"},{"startMs":679520,"durationMs":2780,"subtitle":"and so people don't like having that disrupted"},{"startMs":682300,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"well it isn't because it psychologically destabilizes them, although it does"},{"startMs":687100,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"it's because it actually destabilizes them"},{"startMs":690300,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"right, if all of a sudden we can't occupy the same"},{"startMs":693900,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"specified domain of territory it isn't only that we are thrown into psychological disarray, although we will be"},{"startMs":701220,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"it's that we will start fighting with each other, like, and that can kill you"},{"startMs":706260,"durationMs":3240,"subtitle":"it's no joke, it kills people a lot, like it happens"},{"startMs":709500,"durationMs":5940,"subtitle":"it can happen very easily that a cohesive social group can fragment along some fracture line"},{"startMs":715480,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"of identity let's say, and all hell breaks loose"},{"startMs":719100,"durationMs":5860,"subtitle":"and you know, that's what the Tutsi's and the Hutu in the, in the, in Rwanda"},{"startMs":725620,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"and those things can get out of control just so fast it's just unbelievable and so"},{"startMs":730660,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"and that wasn't, death anxiety, that was death, that's a whole different thing"},{"startMs":735940,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"and that's the other thing that terror management people don't exactly get, it's like"},{"startMs":739720,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"it isn't just that your culture and cultural beliefs protect you from anxiety"},{"startMs":744160,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and say anxiety about death even, it's that they actually protect you from death!"},{"startMs":748880,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"as well as protecting you from death anxiety, I mean look"},{"startMs":753140,"durationMs":1120,"subtitle":"It's warm in here"},{"startMs":755280,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"it's cold outside"},{"startMs":756500,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"the fact that the culture is intact means that you are not outside freezing"},{"startMs":761460,"durationMs":5260,"subtitle":"that's a hell of a lot more fundamental in some sense than mere anxiety, although"},{"startMs":766720,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"I am not trying to underplay the role of anxiety that's a major issue, but"},{"startMs":771160,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"there is something that is a lot more fundamental at stake that mere psychology"},{"startMs":775560,"durationMs":7240,"subtitle":"so it's the match between your map of the world and other peoples actions that regulates your emotions"},{"startMs":783420,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"and, and it regulates it completely, because"},{"startMs":786640,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"you know if someone in here starting acting seriously deranged"},{"startMs":790960,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"like brandished a pistol, let's say"},{"startMs":793760,"durationMs":3780,"subtitle":"all of a sudden you would not be in the same place"},{"startMs":797600,"durationMs":640,"subtitle":"at all"},{"startMs":798720,"durationMs":880,"subtitle":"not a bit"},{"startMs":800060,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and so what would happen, well"},{"startMs":802860,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"chaos would happen"},{"startMs":804140,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and chaos isn't just that you would get anxious, that's not a good enough explanation"},{"startMs":808860,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"what would happen is a lot more complex than that, what happens in some sense is that your body"},{"startMs":814260,"durationMs":6820,"subtitle":"and it does this, it does this, what would happen is that you would react the same way that a rat reacts to a cat"},{"startMs":821080,"durationMs":3480,"subtitle":"it's exactly that, it's exactly that, you would respond as if"},{"startMs":824900,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"a terrible predator had emerged in your midst"},{"startMs":827940,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And so, What is that reaction?

is useful, that would just make you freeze, that could be the worst thing you could do"},{"startMs":840020,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"freeze and well you are a pretty easy target"},{"startMs":843440,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"so you have to be prepared for a lot broader range of responses that mere, mere"},{"startMs":849540,"durationMs":2040,"subtitle":"mere, petrification"},{"startMs":851580,"durationMs":2280,"subtitle":"like how about a little aggression"},{"startMs":853860,"durationMs":3460,"subtitle":"that might be helpful, you don't know it also might get you killed but,"},{"startMs":857320,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"but maybe you could take the guy down and maybe that's a good idea"},{"startMs":861400,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"you know and, and maybe you have to run, so that's disinhibited as well"},{"startMs":866040,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"and maybe you have to think really quickly"},{"startMs":868120,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and reflexively, so that happens, that's actively disinhibited I would say as well, it's like"},{"startMs":873720,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"your whole being thrown into intense concentration on the moment"},{"startMs":878360,"durationMs":5180,"subtitle":"and you are burning up physiological resources like mad, and so what will happen after something like that"},{"startMs":883540,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"if you don't develop outright post-traumatic stress disorder,

would walk out of here shaking with your heart rate at like 170, and it would take you like"},{"startMs":897920,"durationMs":2540,"subtitle":"well it might take you the rest of your

alert"},{"startMs":1357240,"durationMs":3940,"subtitle":"you know, it's ready to dart this way or that way, especially a pray animal"},{"startMs":1361780,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"instantaneously

snake"},{"startMs":1388400,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"you know, and maybe it takes a 1/4 of a second or something like that"},{"startMs":1391840,"durationMs":960,"subtitle":"or even longer"},{"startMs":1393380,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"but it doesn't matter, maybe it takes a tenth"},{"startMs":1396100,"durationMs":5800,"subtitle":"a twentieth of a second, a tenth of a second

way"},{"startMs":1406240,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and so it can nail you way faster that you can look at it so, you have"},{"startMs":1411500,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"your eyes map snake

what I would say that what we do is that we live in a shared story"},{"startMs":1433600,"durationMs":5380,"subtitle":"and the story is a way of looking at the world and it's a way of acting in the world at the same time"},{"startMs":1438980,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"and that story has to operate within narrow parameters"},{"startMs":1442580,"durationMs":2900,"subtitle":"and this is something that is extraordinarily important to understand"},{"startMs":1445480,"durationMs":4440,"subtitle":"because, and this is something I think that Piaget figured out, Jean
