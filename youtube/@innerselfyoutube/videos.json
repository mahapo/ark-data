Always pause and re-assess your thoughts.\nIn this video, Louise Hay will impart her wisdom and enlighten us.\nTake your time and express the self-love that you feel. When one has been in survival mode for an extended period of time, it takes time to recover and uncover oneself. Recognize that you are human and require a break. Realizing that after a favorable setback, you can emerge even stronger than before. You have value. Living in a state of constant vigilance against external threats and in a perpetual state of survival can be difficult. You deserve some time off because of this. These characteristics may be genuine or imagined, physiological or psychological, but to you they are real, and that should be what matters.\n\nYou can find more of Louise Hay work here:\nhttps://www.louisehay.com\n\nLouise hay playlist - https://bit.ly/3BynWny\n\nWatch our more videos here:\n\n👉 The most powerful practice you can do | How to end your suffering\nhttps://youtu.be/0Sq_l0FZnyk\n\n👉 How to attract exactly what you want | Louise hay 2022\nhttps://youtu.be/k9zRH9HcNFM\n\n👉Try It For 3 days to manifest anything you want | money will flow like crazy | Abraham hicks\nhttps://youtu.be/X7uv7qgEM3A\n\n👉 you can attract anything once you know this | Bob proctor\nhttps://youtu.be/NX1lXn-Wq_o\n\nTopics -\nLouise hay you can heal your life\nLouise hay experience your good now\nLouise hay universe loves grateful people \nLouise hay use affirmation to change your life\nLouise hay loving yourself\n\n🔈 CREDITS :   Script Writing And Voice Over By inner self Team \n🔈 CREDITS :  louise hay\n🔈 CREDITS :  Stock Footages Are Commercially Licensed From Story blocks\n🔈 CREDITS :  Music Is Commercially copyrighted free\n🔈 CREDITS :  Edited By inner self  \n\n►Copyright disclaimer:\nWe Hold all the rights of voice over and script on our channel .We own commercial licenses for all the content used in my channel.

Always pause and re-assess your thoughts.\n\nIn this video, Louise Hay will impart her wisdom and enlighten us.\n\nTake your time and express the self-love that you feel. When one has been in survival mode for an extended period of time, it takes time to recover and uncover oneself. Recognize that you are human and require a break. Realizing that after a favorable setback, you can emerge even stronger than before. You have value. Living in a state of constant vigilance against external threats and in a perpetual state of survival can be difficult. You deserve some time off because of this. These characteristics may be genuine or imagined, physiological or psychological, but to you they are real, and that should be what matters.\n\n\nYou can find more of Louise Hay work here:\n\nhttps://www.louisehay.com\n\n\nLouise hay playlist - https://bit.ly/3BynWny\n\n\n\nTopics -\n\nLouise hay you can heal your life\n\nLouise hay experience your good now\n\nLouise hay universe loves grateful people \n\nLouise hay use affirmation to change your life\n\nLouise hay loving yourself\n\n\n\n🔈 CREDITS :   Script Writing And Voice Over By inner self Team \n\n🔈 CREDITS :  louise hay\n\n🔈 CREDITS :  Stock Footages Are Commercially Licensed From Story blocks\n\n🔈 CREDITS :  Music Is Commercially copyrighted free\n\n🔈 CREDITS :  Edited By inner self  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n►Copyright disclaimer:\n\nWe Hold all the rights of voice over and script on our channel .We own commercial licenses for all the content used in my channel.

I'm not talking about metaphorically. I am being literal. You are the God that is referred to in numerous religions around the world. Specifically, the most accurate comparison of God to us is in the Christian Bible, but it has been horribly mistranslated and consecrated by every sect of Christianity in the world.\n\nThe world has been flooded so entirely by various translations and interpretations that even if the final truth was presented to the majority of people, it would be brushed off as another ignored and stupid attempt to convince people to believe in something that is not real. I fell into the category of people whom had once believed in God, but completely abandoned any attempt to conform to a standard ideal because of how I was so let down by multiple sects. \n\nThe main reason I completely abandoned any idea of God, or Christianity, is because I was made a fool multiple times. Large clubs of people gather and feed off of each other's beliefs. They hold blind faith in the highest of regards. They make no effort of their own to test and prove that God is real, but would rather conform to the image of their friends, safely hiding behind mass-hysteria. \n\nBut then I found it. After I had given up all trust in the possibility that any mainstream idea could present to me, I had a powerful experience that changed and shaped my life entirely -- radically altering my human experience once and for all. This was not from a book, nor from a lecture, nor a priest. It was an independent experience that proved to me something that no one else could. That I was God.\n\nWatch our more videos here : \n\n👉Heal every disease | cells of your body will be healed permanently | Louise hey \nhttps://youtu.be/uefQliQjEis\n\n👉 Secret of all power| healing | Wayne Dyer\nhttps://youtu.be/1waHtJwcRaw\n\n👉 Use your powerful form to transform your life | Don't skip this | Wayne Dyer \nhttps://youtu.be/jrE-WKs9ceI\n\n👉Transform your life in 2 hours | Louise hay \nhttps://youtu.be/dhhmLXmEoWM\n\n🔈 CREDITS :   Script Writing And Voice Over By inner self Team \n🔈 CREDITS :  Inspired By The teachings Wayne dyer\n🔈 CREDITS :  Stock Footages Are Commercially Licensed From Story blocks\n🔈 CREDITS :  Music Is Commercially copyrighted free\n🔈 CREDITS :  Edited By inner self  \n\nWayne Dyer playlist - https://bit.ly/3R8kFiT\n\n►Copyright disclaimer:\nWe Hold all the rights of voice over and script on our channel .We own commercial licenses for all the content used in my channel.

The problem is that most of the people are not aware of the benefits of affirmations and meditation.\n\nAffirmations in New Thought and New Age terminology refer primarily to the practice of positive thinking and self-empowerment - a belief that a positive mental attitude supported by affirmations will achieve success in anything. More specifically, an affirmation is a carefully formatted statement that should be repeated to one's self and written down frequently. For affirmations to be effective, it is said that they need to be present tense, positive, personal and specific. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWatch Our Best Videos Here:\n\n👉Just Stop This & Your All Energy Blockages Will Be Cleared In 3 Days | Louise Hay\nhttps://youtu.be/vb7-ZJyTf1Q\n\n👉Something Magical Will Happen If You Practice Like This | Louise Hay\nhttps://youtu.be/xGGYEWISkwU\n\n👉This Is Why I Am Always Relaxed And Happy | Learn This To Attract Anything | Louise hay\nhttps://youtu.be/X0C0WyeBtVg\n\n👉 The most powerful practice you can do | How to end your suffering\nhttps://youtu.be/0Sq_l0FZnyk\n\n👉 How to attract exactly what you want | Louise hay 2022\nhttps://youtu.be/k9zRH9HcNFM\n\n👉Try It For 3 days to manifest anything you want | money will flow like crazy| Abraham hicks\nhttps://youtu.be/X7uv7qgEM3A\n\nLouise hay affirmations\naffirmations for anxiety \nlouise hay wealth affirmation \nlouise hay wealth and prosperity \nlouise hay affirmations for money\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpeaker - Louise Hay\nAbout Louise Hay -\nLouise Hay (born October 8, 1926) is an American motivational author and the founder of Hay House, she has authored several New Thought self-help books, including the 1984 international bestseller You Can Heal Your Life.

You can learn and use these laws to your advantage or deny they exist and float through life with little to no control. \n\nWhat do you really want? Do you know? Have you let all the big dreams you had as a kid slip away? Why? What if there is a way to still achieve those dreams in life? Sounds too good to be true right? If it sounds too good, then it probably is. Is this saying always true? i have found that it is most of the time, but not all.\n\n This is real. After being introduced to Bob’s works you can no longer go through life and say you never had a chance at something better. I can say this because I took the chance even though I had failed so many times at so many different courses and businesses. There is no “probably” with Bob. He is the best I have ever seen or been around. He is real and cares about you .
