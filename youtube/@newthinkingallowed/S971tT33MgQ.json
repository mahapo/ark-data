that."},{"startMs":714960,"durationMs":6680,"subtitle":"It's purely, as I said, with that tiny bit of front loading, where they ask a question"},{"startMs":721640,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"as

way."},{"startMs":809680,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"Most people don't realize that, or at least for me it does, and maybe...I'm not what"},{"startMs":813760,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"you might
