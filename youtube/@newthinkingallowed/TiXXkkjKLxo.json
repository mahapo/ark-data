years"},{"startMs":243819,"durationMs":1821,"subtitle":"ago, Daniel number three began to emerge that"},{"startMs":245640,"durationMs":1669,"subtitle":"was taking a look at the best of these and"},{"startMs":247321,"durationMs":1759,"subtitle":"figuring out how they could get along a whole"},{"startMs":249080,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"lot better and then joining a team of people"},{"startMs":252132,"durationMs":3188,"subtitle":"and figuring out how that could scale globally."},{"startMs":255320,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"So that's what I currently spend my time doing."},{"startMs":258360,"durationMs":2257,"subtitle":"So was it your personal experience being told"},{"startMs":260629,"durationMs":2171,"subtitle":"you might need medications or you could have"},{"startMs":262800,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"thought to have been needing that and also being a physician and seeing other people"},{"startMs":267800,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"have these

you"},{"startMs":363120,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"doing with your summer Daniel and I'm like oh I'm doing this thing and they were like"},{"startMs":366800,"durationMs":2161,"subtitle":"well that

variants of each of these things and so"},{"startMs":445515,"durationMs":3005,"subtitle":"for the moment we're keeping it a pretty broad"},{"startMs":448520,"durationMs":9080,"subtitle":"category and yeah I'll start with that and you probably have questions and thoughts."},{"startMs":457600,"durationMs":2564,"subtitle":"Well what comes to mind is like you said that"},{"startMs":460176,"durationMs":2464,"subtitle":"you were four years old and this is a really"},{"startMs":462640,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"core component of our consciousness of who we are as humans."},{"startMs":467640,"durationMs":3028,"subtitle":"Yeah and the number of family members I've had"},{"startMs":470680,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"who got into these things sort of spontaneously"},{"startMs":473720,"durationMs":2661,"subtitle":"or without obvious cause, the number of"},{"startMs":476393,"durationMs":3207,"subtitle":"friends, the number of reports I've read online."},{"startMs":479600,"durationMs":2084,"subtitle":"This is definitely a relatively common part"},{"startMs":481696,"durationMs":2144,"subtitle":"of human experience to at least get into some"},{"startMs":483840,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"of this territory."},{"startMs":486640,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"And what you and the consortium are trying to"},{"startMs":489452,"durationMs":2628,"subtitle":"do if I understand it correctly is research"},{"startMs":492080,"durationMs":3402,"subtitle":"these phenomena and understand how they could"},{"startMs":495494,"durationMs":3266,"subtitle":"be induced, how they can spontaneously arise"},{"startMs":498760,"durationMs":3902,"subtitle":"and look at what might be some of the more"},{"startMs":502674,"durationMs":4006,"subtitle":"beneficial approaches to help an individual,"},{"startMs":506680,"durationMs":2973,"subtitle":"where there might be potential harm for

better."},{"startMs":517720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"Yeah basically so we have two sides of the thing."},{"startMs":521400,"durationMs":2124,"subtitle":"Well if you have the side, the effects that"},{"startMs":523536,"durationMs":2184,"subtitle":"people don't like, dark nights or existential"},{"startMs":525720,"durationMs":2448,"subtitle":"crises or weird movements or whatever it is"},{"startMs":528180,"durationMs":2460,"subtitle":"that they don't like, the sense that they're"},{"startMs":530640,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"not in control."},{"startMs":531640,"durationMs":1920,"subtitle":"Some people really like that, some people really don't."},{"startMs":533560,"durationMs":2634,"subtitle":"Right so there's this wide range of

effects."},{"startMs":540520,"durationMs":2289,"subtitle":"And so then the question is how in the world"},{"startMs":542821,"durationMs":2199,"subtitle":"can we have high quality data that compares"},{"startMs":545020,"durationMs":3540,"subtitle":"various methods of dealing with these, pharmaceutical"},{"startMs":548572,"durationMs":2828,"subtitle":"and non-pharmaceutical obviously, that help"},{"startMs":551400,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"people have better outcomes."},{"startMs":553520,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"So that's question number one."},{"startMs":554800,"durationMs":2313,"subtitle":"And then sort of the other question which"},{"startMs":557125,"durationMs":2435,"subtitle":"is equally as important as these experiences"},{"startMs":559560,"durationMs":3073,"subtitle":"and practices, what we call emergent practices,"},{"startMs":562645,"durationMs":2635,"subtitle":"can also are widely reported and found

that."},{"startMs":575960,"durationMs":2148,"subtitle":"And then the question is how do you support"},{"startMs":578120,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"those from the sort of a positive psychology"},{"startMs":580280,"durationMs":1080,"subtitle":"point of view."},{"startMs":581360,"durationMs":4100,"subtitle":"And it's also widely reported that some of these ones might actually be precursors to"},{"startMs":585460,"durationMs":4500,"subtitle":"some of these ones and that some of these ones might sometimes be followed by crises."},{"startMs":589960,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"So the number of people I've talked to had something like a peak experience or a first"},{"startMs":593560,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"major opening and then they found something challenging after that and integrating it"},{"startMs":597880,"durationMs":2157,"subtitle":"or making sense of it or brought up a bunch of"},{"startMs":600049,"durationMs":2031,"subtitle":"other material or layers of mind or whatever"},{"startMs":602080,"durationMs":1480,"subtitle":"you want to call it."},{"startMs":603560,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"And so not only understanding the kind of positive and negative ones and then they're"},{"startMs":608280,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"just the weird ones, right, which aren't really necessarily negative or positive."},{"startMs":611600,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"They're just strange, but they could cause people a lot of

really that nice, just kind of neutral, right?"},{"startMs":623020,"durationMs":2481,"subtitle":"And then sort of also lending a sense of this sort"},{"startMs":625513,"durationMs":2347,"subtitle":"of the potential for development or transforming"},{"startMs":627860,"durationMs":2327,"subtitle":"one into the other or seeing the opportunities"},{"startMs":630199,"durationMs":2041,"subtitle":"and challenges or seeing the shadow sides"},{"startMs":632240,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"of some of the positive ones, right?"},{"startMs":634320,"durationMs":2953,"subtitle":"And so these kinds of

number of people"},{"startMs":655280,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"that might get into this territory."},{"startMs":657040,"durationMs":1911,"subtitle":"And particularly given that meditation
