It's ironic actually"},{"startMs":2706760,"durationMs":3779,"subtitle":"because in mainstream medium, they're still"},{"startMs":2710551,"durationMs":4049,"subtitle":"talking about this is a fake.

And I gather you've witnessed it firsthand."},{"startMs":2760200,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"Yeah. Yeah. And part of the time is actually working with children and working,"},{"startMs":2765000,"durationMs":5130,"subtitle":"say, how they do. And it does actually help"},{"startMs":2770142,"durationMs":5258,"subtitle":"them to do their schoolwork. Yeah. So they're"},{"startMs":2775400,"durationMs":5588,"subtitle":"trained to have a mind vision. Yeah. And they can"},{"startMs":2781000,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"use the mind vision as information storage device."},{"startMs":2786600,"durationMs":10960,"subtitle":"Yeah. So they can store the photograph of each page of the book. Yeah. So then they"},{"startMs":2797560,"durationMs":2974,"subtitle":"have different stages of the training. Yeah. Yeah."},{"startMs":2800546,"durationMs":2694,"subtitle":"Do I have opportunity to describe what kind of"},{"startMs":2803240,"durationMs":5308,"subtitle":"changes? Yeah. They normally start with the"},{"startMs":2808560,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"color of the cards. Yeah. You have different"},{"startMs":2813880,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"color of cards, and you blind children ask them to see which card is which color."},{"startMs":2823000,"durationMs":4548,"subtitle":"So gradually they develop a color into their"},{"startMs":2827560,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"vision. And then they can see the card itself"},{"startMs":2833000,"durationMs":4132,"subtitle":"without the physical eye. And the next stage"},{"startMs":2837144,"durationMs":3776,"subtitle":"is write the character, write the symbols"},{"startMs":2840920,"durationMs":3789,"subtitle":"in piece of paper. Again, blind fold.

Yeah."},{"startMs":2852788,"durationMs":4612,"subtitle":"So the next stage is to photographic memory."},{"startMs":2857400,"durationMs":4841,"subtitle":"They can photograph what have appeared in a vision"},{"startMs":2862253,"durationMs":4187,"subtitle":"and store them. Yeah. So they can photograph"},{"startMs":2866440,"durationMs":5748,"subtitle":"each page of the book. Initially, they can look"},{"startMs":2872200,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"at the book and they can photograph the page"},{"startMs":2877480,"durationMs":4070,"subtitle":"into the book. They can retrieve this page. Yeah."},{"startMs":2881562,"durationMs":3918,"subtitle":"Whenever they want to. Yeah. Then the next stage"},{"startMs":2885480,"durationMs":4889,"subtitle":"is actually they don't even need to spend time"},{"startMs":2890381,"durationMs":4379,"subtitle":"to photograph. They can just flip the book"},{"startMs":2894760,"durationMs":5244,"subtitle":"like that. All the pages will be in their mind"},{"startMs":2900016,"durationMs":5144,"subtitle":"vision. Yeah. If you ask them, can you tell me"},{"startMs":2905160,"durationMs":4261,"subtitle":"what page, page 500, for example, what's on page"},{"startMs":2909433,"durationMs":4447,"subtitle":"500, they can tell you. They can read it backwards."},{"startMs":2914840,"durationMs":4920,"subtitle":"So it's not, it's not a memory. It's a photography."},{"startMs":2919772,"durationMs":4268,"subtitle":"Yeah. It's an image of all the pages they can"},{"startMs":2924040,"durationMs":4546,"subtitle":"retrieve. Yeah. So the next stage is actually"},{"startMs":2928598,"durationMs":4162,"subtitle":"they don't have to even open a book. Yeah."},{"startMs":2932760,"durationMs":4601,"subtitle":"They can do that remotely. Sometimes kids,"},{"startMs":2937373,"durationMs":4827,"subtitle":"advanced children, they can actually retrieve"},{"startMs":2942200,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"a content of a book from a library, which they don't possess. Yeah."},{"startMs":2949240,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"Yeah. So next stage is actually to access a non-physical teacher or non-physical tutor."},{"startMs":2960360,"durationMs":4630,"subtitle":"For example, whatever skills you want to learn,"},{"startMs":2965002,"durationMs":4158,"subtitle":"you can create a tutor in your mind vision."},{"startMs":2969160,"durationMs":3887,"subtitle":"You can interact with that tutor. And that"},{"startMs":2973059,"durationMs":4261,"subtitle":"tutor can tutor you. Whatever subject you want."},{"startMs":2977320,"durationMs":5431,"subtitle":"Yeah. For example, if you want to sort of improve"},{"startMs":2982763,"durationMs":5117,"subtitle":"the piano lesson, you can get Chopin to come to"},{"startMs":2987880,"durationMs":4972,"subtitle":"teach you, to correct you.

If"},{"startMs":2992864,"durationMs":4776,"subtitle":"you want to sort of improve your golf playing,"},{"startMs":2997640,"durationMs":4420,"subtitle":"for example, you can get Tiger Woods to come."},{"startMs":3002072,"durationMs":4528,"subtitle":"Yeah. So it's not only the dead people. You can"},{"startMs":3006600,"durationMs":4311,"subtitle":"access a non-physical version of living people. And"},{"startMs":3010923,"durationMs":4157,"subtitle":"if they want to learn parapsychology, for example,"},{"startMs":3016040,"durationMs":5094,"subtitle":"they can get a non-physical Jeffrey Mishlove to"},{"startMs":3021146,"durationMs":4894,"subtitle":"teach them. And that non-physical Jeff is much"},{"startMs":3026040,"durationMs":3988,"subtitle":"more intelligent. Yeah. Much more wise. They know"},{"startMs":3030040,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"what the children needs to do. They know the level"},{"startMs":3034040,"durationMs":4040,"subtitle":"of the children. Yeah. So that's advanced the"},{"startMs":3038092,"durationMs":3788,"subtitle":"stage. And also, they can create more time."},{"startMs":3043000,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"At that mind vision, it's another world. Yeah. That world has a different clock."},{"startMs":3050840,"durationMs":3644,"subtitle":"So they can create, for example, in the physical"},{"startMs":3054496,"durationMs":2984,"subtitle":"level of the universe, you have one now."},{"startMs":3057480,"durationMs":4892,"subtitle":"In the different level of that non-physical"},{"startMs":3062384,"durationMs":5016,"subtitle":"world, you can have eight hours. So they have"},{"startMs":3067400,"durationMs":4350,"subtitle":"a lot more time to learn. It's all very impressive."},{"startMs":3071762,"durationMs":4278,"subtitle":"And I guess it also entails projecting their mental"},{"startMs":3076040,"durationMs":3860,"subtitle":"images onto both Polaroid film. And I think"},{"startMs":3079912,"durationMs":4048,"subtitle":"you've mentioned onto the memory of an iPhone."},{"startMs":3083960,"durationMs":4967,"subtitle":"Yeah. Yeah. That's a new thing.

Another thing"},{"startMs":3171192,"durationMs":4128,"subtitle":"they can do is they can do complex mathematical"},{"startMs":3175320,"durationMs":6079,"subtitle":"problems by accessing a mental non-physical"},{"startMs":3181411,"durationMs":6229,"subtitle":"calculator.
