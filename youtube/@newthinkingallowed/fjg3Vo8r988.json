sort of absolutely the tabletop."},{"startMs":329360,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"There's no question."},{"startMs":330360,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"And I think, well, science is on some other

say."},{"startMs":358480,"durationMs":2939,"subtitle":"And he discovered that the only absolute is the"},{"startMs":361431,"durationMs":2889,"subtitle":"relativity, which sounds kind of contradictory."},{"startMs":364320,"durationMs":3093,"subtitle":"But if we if you think about it, people who"},{"startMs":367425,"durationMs":3175,"subtitle":"believe in an omnipotent God, who's absolute,"},{"startMs":370600,"durationMs":2831,"subtitle":"and yet relates to the world by creating it,"},{"startMs":373443,"durationMs":2717,"subtitle":"they're sort of using the word absolute

way."},{"startMs":382400,"durationMs":3017,"subtitle":"So the point is, if you pursue with scientific"},{"startMs":385429,"durationMs":2771,"subtitle":"and philosophic logic, you come up with the"},{"startMs":388200,"durationMs":3093,"subtitle":"idea that there is no such thing as an absolute"},{"startMs":391305,"durationMs":2975,"subtitle":"that could be relative to any relational thing"},{"startMs":394280,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"or relevant to any relational thing."},{"startMs":397280,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"So therefore, the absolute thing is the relativity of everything."},{"startMs":403200,"durationMs":3370,"subtitle":"And that sort of understanding of the world,"},{"startMs":406582,"durationMs":3458,"subtitle":"and with the preposterous claim that the human"},{"startMs":410040,"durationMs":4415,"subtitle":"being is capable of understanding that, that's"},{"startMs":414467,"durationMs":4333,"subtitle":"called wisdom, you know, and then if we really"},{"startMs":418800,"durationMs":5400,"subtitle":"understand the world well, according to the Buddha, we will realize that the world is"},{"startMs":424200,"durationMs":6200,"subtitle":"made of an energy that is basically blissful."},{"startMs":430400,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"And we ourselves are made of that."},{"startMs":433320,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"And any kind of perception that we have of misery or pain is our misperception of what"},{"startMs":440280,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"we are perceiving."},{"startMs":442360,"durationMs":7640,"subtitle":"And therefore, we have a saying in English, ignorance is bliss, meaning that we sort of"},{"startMs":450000,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"scared of the nature of what reality might be."},{"startMs":453000,"durationMs":2788,"subtitle":"It might be bad, so it's better not to know"},{"startMs":455800,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"what it is and sort of get in the zone

directly"},{"startMs":464574,"durationMs":2706,"subtitle":"contradicting that and saying that the more"},{"startMs":467280,"durationMs":3538,"subtitle":"reality we know, the happier we will be, because"},{"startMs":470830,"durationMs":2970,"subtitle":"that was what Buddha taught his students."},{"startMs":473800,"durationMs":2252,"subtitle":"And the whole the huge tradition, which is"},{"startMs":476064,"durationMs":2316,"subtitle":"thought of as a religious tradition, is kind"},{"startMs":478380,"durationMs":2815,"subtitle":"of more an educational scientific tradition,"},{"startMs":481207,"durationMs":2953,"subtitle":"but wants people to know what their own reality"},{"startMs":484160,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"really is, because then they'll be happy."},{"startMs":487840,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"Then what would you describe or how would you define what wisdom is?"},{"startMs":492800,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"Well, wisdom is the knowing of what you really are, of what reality really is."},{"startMs":499400,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"For example, I'm alive, supposedly."},{"startMs":504200,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"And also, I don't feel particularly bad right now."},{"startMs":508440,"durationMs":3566,"subtitle":"And so I have a feeling of well-being within"},{"startMs":512018,"durationMs":3022,"subtitle":"me, and

fingers or whatever I can do."},{"startMs":534920,"durationMs":4271,"subtitle":"And so in other words, the whole reality of"},{"startMs":539203,"durationMs":4477,"subtitle":"me functions well in a reasonable environment."},{"startMs":543680,"durationMs":4033,"subtitle":"And if I knew the deeper reality, the actual"},{"startMs":547725,"durationMs":3955,"subtitle":"force of life itself is this infinite energy"},{"startMs":551680,"durationMs":6120,"subtitle":"that is ready to fulfill any need, actually."},{"startMs":557800,"durationMs":3168,"subtitle":"But if I don't think that and I run down and I"},{"startMs":560980,"durationMs":3180,"subtitle":"say, oh, well, maybe I won't get food tomorrow,"},{"startMs":564160,"durationMs":2876,"subtitle":"I better eat a lot of food today, then I could"},{"startMs":567048,"durationMs":3072,"subtitle":"make myself sick by putting my body into imbalance"},{"startMs":570120,"durationMs":2181,"subtitle":"by paranoidly eating everything thinking"},{"startMs":572313,"durationMs":2407,"subtitle":"that I'll only get to eat today or something."},{"startMs":574720,"durationMs":3628,"subtitle":"In other words, if I get mistaken ideas about"},{"startMs":578360,"durationMs":3640,"subtitle":"what I am, I would end up harming myself while"},{"startMs":582000,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"trying to somehow prevent the negative thing."},{"startMs":585760,"durationMs":2836,"subtitle":"Now Buddha's argument was or Buddha's discovery"},{"startMs":588608,"durationMs":2552,"subtitle":"was that if you deeply know what you really"},{"startMs":591160,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"are, you would sort of realize you are God, really."},{"startMs":597480,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"And everybody else also is, really."},{"startMs":599960,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"And the time when you sort of most know it is when you're not completely convinced to"},{"startMs":606680,"durationMs":3960,"subtitle":"think of whatever you see with your five senses is the real thing."},{"startMs":610640,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"But you are just completely open, like an open space."},{"startMs":615400,"durationMs":6360,"subtitle":"And the time when that normally happens to people is when they sleep, fall into deep"},{"startMs":621760,"durationMs":3688,"subtitle":"sleep unconsciously, and then they fit into"},{"startMs":625460,"durationMs":3700,"subtitle":"something called what is called clear light."},{"startMs":629160,"durationMs":3880,"subtitle":"That's the infinite love energy of the universe."},{"startMs":633040,"durationMs":5640,"subtitle":"But in a way, you can't really experience it as an object because you're made of it."},{"startMs":638680,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"So if you're God, you can't see God as a separate thing, in other words."},{"startMs":643000,"durationMs":3394,"subtitle":"So some sort of rigid, dualistic theologians of"},{"startMs":646406,"durationMs":3194,"subtitle":"monotheism, like some Protestant theologians,"},{"startMs":649600,"durationMs":3186,"subtitle":"for example, or some Muslims, they would say"},{"startMs":652798,"durationMs":3482,"subtitle":"that's a heresy of a pantheistic heresy, thinking"},{"startMs":656280,"durationMs":3029,"subtitle":"that God is everything, you know, rather than"},{"startMs":659321,"durationMs":3239,"subtitle":"God is something outside the universe, completely"},{"startMs":662560,"durationMs":2607,"subtitle":"absolute and not relative, and yet somehow"},{"startMs":665179,"durationMs":2741,"subtitle":"relate creates it out of nothing, all a bunch"},{"startMs":667920,"durationMs":3319,"subtitle":"of completely common sense wise, meaningless"},{"startMs":671251,"durationMs":3109,"subtitle":"things, because they're using words in the"},{"startMs":674360,"durationMs":5320,"subtitle":"opposite sense of what they mean, because absolute means not relative."},{"startMs":679680,"durationMs":2607,"subtitle":"So an absolute thing, if there were such a"},{"startMs":682299,"durationMs":2741,"subtitle":"thing, couldn't relate to any relative thing."},{"startMs":685040,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"So it would be irrelevant to the relative thing, or if once it related, it would be"},{"startMs":689120,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"a relative thing, if you follow me."},{"startMs":691760,"durationMs":2541,"subtitle":"So that's that's the famous Buddhist concept"},{"startMs":694313,"durationMs":2327,"subtitle":"of emptiness, or discovery, you could say"},{"startMs":696640,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"of emptiness, which some people only think is a discovery, like what reality is this"},{"startMs":701520,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"open space."},{"startMs":702520,"durationMs":5880,"subtitle":"But that's not the case, because emptiness only means that all the relative things are"},{"startMs":708400,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"empty of anything is separate from their interconnection."},{"startMs":713120,"durationMs":3724,"subtitle":"So that means in a way, the discovery of emptiness"},{"startMs":716856,"durationMs":3224,"subtitle":"is that we are completely relational beings."},{"startMs":720080,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"So the other thing that wisdom is, we go back"},{"startMs":722492,"durationMs":2308,"subtitle":"to your question on wisdom, is if you really"},{"startMs":724800,"durationMs":3311,"subtitle":"know wisdom, what you know is that how you"},{"startMs":728123,"durationMs":3477,"subtitle":"relate to relative things is kind of the most"},{"startMs":731600,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"amazing thing you can possibly do."},{"startMs":734520,"durationMs":4520,"subtitle":"And when you're relating to other sensitive beings, then you never want to cause

good."},{"startMs":743680,"durationMs":6420,"subtitle":"So that's called love, to wash the beloved to feel good to be happy."},{"startMs":750100,"durationMs":2818,"subtitle":"And it's called compassion, which means the"},{"startMs":752930,"durationMs":2830,"subtitle":"unwillingness to the unbearable feeling that"},{"startMs":755760,"durationMs":2617,"subtitle":"other suffering is unbearable to you equal to"},{"startMs":758389,"durationMs":2571,"subtitle":"your own suffering, or you never want anybody"},{"startMs":760960,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"else to suffer."},{"startMs":761960,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"You know, that's compassion."},{"startMs":762960,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"So love and compassion are like two sides of the same coin."},{"startMs":767560,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"And so wisdom becomes love and compassion, when it's complete, which means to say that"},{"startMs":772400,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"you
