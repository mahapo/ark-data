anything."},{"startMs":453500,"durationMs":3903,"subtitle":"We wanted the original filter to be taken off"},{"startMs":457415,"durationMs":4085,"subtitle":"and then have the sensor being naked

infrared spectrum part that you want."},{"startMs":492500,"durationMs":7944,"subtitle":"And then he showed us a lot of videos on our big screen in our own office standing up with"},{"startMs":500456,"durationMs":8044,"subtitle":"a laser pointer and everything showing the videos of these UFOs that were very clearly UFOs."},{"startMs":508500,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"Now by UFO we're talking about unidentified flying object."},{"startMs":513500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Physical things that were clearly

that."},{"startMs":530500,"durationMs":3072,"subtitle":"He's not saying where they came from but these are the"},{"startMs":533584,"durationMs":2916,"subtitle":"things people have been talking about forever, UFOs."},{"startMs":536500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"And he said this is how you take pictures."},{"startMs":539500,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"And then he also talked about the frame rate issue because they go so fast."},{"startMs":544500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And he was telling us the speeds and we said what speeds?"},{"startMs":546500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"And he said typically we're seeing them at 20,000 miles an hour."},{"startMs":549500,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"I said what?"},{"startMs":550500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"That's 32,000 kilometers an hour."},{"startMs":552500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And so that was like, anyway, so he told us to get the cameras."},{"startMs":556500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"So we already had GH5s."},{"startMs":558500,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"So then we had to raise some money to get two GH6s."},{"startMs":564500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And then we had to take those GH6s and ship them out to LifePixel."},{"startMs":568500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"That was in December of 2022."},{"startMs":570500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"He came to us in December of 2022."},{"startMs":572500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"We got our cameras."},{"startMs":574500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"We shipped them out in late December

videos."},{"startMs":584500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"I was sort of skeptical."},{"startMs":586500,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"Now my son, Aziz, he says, Dad, just follow"},{"startMs":589812,"durationMs":3688,"subtitle":"exactly what – now his name is Lincoln Lounsbury."},{"startMs":593500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"So he's not hiding who he is."},{"startMs":595500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Follow exactly what Lincoln said to do, step by step."},{"startMs":599500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"Try to duplicate it."},{"startMs":601500,"durationMs":3901,"subtitle":"So we were used to using like log footage or"},{"startMs":605413,"durationMs":4087,"subtitle":"monochrome or some different settings, he said."},{"startMs":609500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And we said no, do it."},{"startMs":611500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"My son said do exactly what Lincoln said to do."},{"startMs":614500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"Standard video settings."},{"startMs":616500,"durationMs":7000,"subtitle":"And then we shot at 120 frames a second, which was as fast as the – in 4K."},{"startMs":623500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"That was as fast as the GH6 could do."},{"startMs":627500,"durationMs":3367,"subtitle":"Now the thing about the GH6, why it was unusual, is you"},{"startMs":630879,"durationMs":3621,"subtitle":"have to shoot wide angle because you can't see these things."},{"startMs":634500,"durationMs":2927,"subtitle":"They're invisible, both because of some stealth"},{"startMs":637439,"durationMs":3061,"subtitle":"technology that you can see them only in infrared."},{"startMs":640500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And secondly, they're going 20,000 miles an hour."},{"startMs":644500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"So it could be the size of the Titanic."},{"startMs":646500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"You're not going to see it if it's 20,000 miles an hour."},{"startMs":649500,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"So we shot it at 120 frames a second."},{"startMs":654500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And we followed the other sort of recommendations that he did."},{"startMs":658500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And then I took the footage."},{"startMs":660500,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"I shot for 10 minutes."},{"startMs":661500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And I was sort of skeptical."},{"startMs":663500,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"I said, how is this going to work?"},{"startMs":664500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"Over your house in Atlanta, as I recall."},{"startMs":667500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Yes, at my house, on the deck in my house in Atlanta."},{"startMs":671500,"durationMs":5000,"subtitle":"And that's actually outside of Decatur, which is just outside of Atlanta."},{"startMs":676500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And we just shot for 10 minutes."},{"startMs":678500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And I wasn't expecting anything because how often do you?"},{"startMs":682500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"I've been thinking, I've been chasing UFOs with remote viewing forever."},{"startMs":686500,"durationMs":5988,"subtitle":"What are the odds that in a random 10 minute period, in the view"},{"startMs":692500,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"of a camera pointed upward at the sky, you're going to get a UFO?"},{"startMs":698500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"It seems to be pretty rare."},{"startMs":700500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"But I followed his advice and he gave us a lot of specific instructions, too."},{"startMs":704500,"durationMs":3417,"subtitle":"The top of the camera, the top of the camera had the cameras horizontal"},{"startMs":707929,"durationMs":3571,"subtitle":"because it's pointing straight up at the top of it had to be pointed north."},{"startMs":711500,"durationMs":3624,"subtitle":"And I had to run some other software like Flight Radar 24 in order"},{"startMs":715136,"durationMs":3364,"subtitle":"to be able to capture all other aircraft that were in the sky."},{"startMs":718500,"durationMs":2050,"subtitle":"And that turned out to be important because there"},{"startMs":720562,"durationMs":1938,"subtitle":"were some other aircraft and he had to be able."},{"startMs":722500,"durationMs":4825,"subtitle":"And that was enabling him to exactly triangulate the exact moment and the"},{"startMs":727337,"durationMs":5163,"subtitle":"space and the altitude of the UFO because he knew the altitude of the aircraft."},{"startMs":732500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"So we did it not expecting much, at least I wasn't expecting much."},{"startMs":736500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"I think that Aziz was a little bit more hopeful."},{"startMs":738500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"And I put it into the software."},{"startMs":741500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"We use Adobe Premiere."},{"startMs":743500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"I slowed it way down because it was 120 frames a second."},{"startMs":747500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"So I slowed it way down so I could watch it frame by frame going through."},{"startMs":751500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And my eyes popped out."},{"startMs":753500,"durationMs":1945,"subtitle":"It was like this is one of

across."},{"startMs":778500,"durationMs":4551,"subtitle":"And there was one like a cigar shape, long cigar shape, and it was going"},{"startMs":783063,"durationMs":4437,"subtitle":"from the low altitude upwards because you could see it getting shorter."},{"startMs":787500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And it went right by a jet."},{"startMs":789500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"The big airliner coming out of Hartsville Airport."},{"startMs":792500,"durationMs":3016,"subtitle":"And that was great because then Lincoln could

time."},{"startMs":800500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"So we and we had a visible light camera."},{"startMs":802500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"Plus, we had two ultraviolet like two ultraviolet."},{"startMs":805500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"I'm sorry, two infrared cameras."},{"startMs":807500,"durationMs":3459,"subtitle":"And so he was able to get all types of triangulation

solid."},{"startMs":820500,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"And it was like, what?"},{"startMs":821500,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"And it was our first time to turn the cameras

happened?"},{"startMs":829500,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And then we went out again later on in January, like a week later."},{"startMs":833500,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And the same thing
