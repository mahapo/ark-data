say."},{"startMs":402680,"durationMs":2628,"subtitle":"I mean, it may well be that the explanation"},{"startMs":405320,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"for child prodigies, musical prodigies, math"},{"startMs":407960,"durationMs":4279,"subtitle":"prodigies, whatever, is the carryover of"},{"startMs":412251,"durationMs":4709,"subtitle":"memories or behaviors from the previous

in that case."},{"startMs":425640,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"But aren't there sometimes examples of other talents?"},{"startMs":428920,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"Well, but there are also a

prodigies."},{"startMs":448080,"durationMs":5678,"subtitle":"But for instance, a recent case that the viewers"},{"startMs":453770,"durationMs":5110,"subtitle":"may be familiar with of a boy who identified"},{"startMs":458880,"durationMs":5734,"subtitle":"himself as Lou Gehrig, reborn, was from a"},{"startMs":464626,"durationMs":6294,"subtitle":"very young age, liked to play baseball,

mother."},{"startMs":490360,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"And he had memories that were consistent with Lou Gehrig's life."},{"startMs":493680,"durationMs":3068,"subtitle":"So in his case, it wasn't

memories."},{"startMs":502320,"durationMs":5920,"subtitle":"And more than behavioral, we're talking, I presume, a level of talent."},{"startMs":508240,"durationMs":2440,"subtitle":"Well, yes."},{"startMs":510680,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"And let's say a level of talent, yes."},{"startMs":514960,"durationMs":3608,"subtitle":"But it was the talent was developed, and this"},{"startMs":518580,"durationMs":3620,"subtitle":"is important, through his continuing practice."},{"startMs":522200,"durationMs":4840,"subtitle":"I mean, he liked to, and it's hard to separate that, isn't it?"},{"startMs":527040,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"But that's what athletes do."},{"startMs":528400,"durationMs":2520,"subtitle":"They practice all the time, you know?"},{"startMs":530920,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"And that's how they become..."},{"startMs":531920,"durationMs":4760,"subtitle":"Well, in my case, I was never very athletic to begin with."},{"startMs":536680,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"I never had much motivation to practice."},{"startMs":540600,"durationMs":3711,"subtitle":"I think you need a certain level of talent

practice."},{"startMs":548600,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"Well, that's right, yes."},{"startMs":549600,"durationMs":2357,"subtitle":"And so you can say that there was some talent"},{"startMs":551969,"durationMs":2471,"subtitle":"there to begin with, and it was nurtured through"},{"startMs":554440,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"the continuing practice."},{"startMs":555800,"durationMs":2906,"subtitle":"And Jim Tucker, who is Ian Stevenson's successor"},{"startMs":558718,"durationMs":2442,"subtitle":"at the University of Virginia, has a case"},{"startMs":561160,"durationMs":6848,"subtitle":"of a golf prodigy, very similar to the Christian"},{"startMs":568020,"durationMs":6020,"subtitle":"health case of a boy who, from a very

winning"},{"startMs":583800,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"junior tournaments and things like that."},{"startMs":586160,"durationMs":8360,"subtitle":"So now, short of prodigies, we do see examples of skills, real skills."},{"startMs":594520,"durationMs":7480,"subtitle":"And these skills are, in some ways, almost more interesting because they emerge sort"},{"startMs":602000,"durationMs":5569,"subtitle":"of full-blown, and they aren't just tendencies"},{"startMs":607581,"durationMs":5699,"subtitle":"towards something which is then nurtured through"},{"startMs":613280,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"practice until it becomes something very important."},{"startMs":615680,"durationMs":2915,"subtitle":"Well, the acquisition of a full-blown skill,"},{"startMs":618607,"durationMs":2993,"subtitle":"I would think, would count as evidence against"},{"startMs":621600,"durationMs":3420,"subtitle":"what we referred to in our previous interview"},{"startMs":625032,"durationMs":3208,"subtitle":"as the living agent psi hypothesis, because"},{"startMs":628240,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"having a skill is not the same as acquiring

last time about super-psi."},{"startMs":654120,"durationMs":3288,"subtitle":"We're moving beyond the level of psi that can"},{"startMs":657420,"durationMs":3300,"subtitle":"be demonstrated in the laboratory to something"},{"startMs":660720,"durationMs":7280,"subtitle":"we have to imagine, an imagined capability, and sort of imagine that if that capability"},{"startMs":668000,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"is developed in a certain way, then that perhaps would explain this."},{"startMs":672240,"durationMs":10200,"subtitle":"But I just think a

explanation"},{"startMs":684773,"durationMs":2387,"subtitle":"of these cases, it becomes much simpler than"},{"startMs":687160,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"to simply accept that the skills are somehow carried over."},{"startMs":691480,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"Well, what are some of these prodigious skills?"},{"startMs":693720,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"Yeah, I wanted to give you an example of them."},{"startMs":696560,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"There was a Brazilian boy who recalled having been his sister."},{"startMs":703200,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"And he was a large family, 13 children, I think, as I recall."},{"startMs":709280,"durationMs":5148,"subtitle":"And the sister who had killed herself, saying"},{"startMs":714440,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"she wanted

machine."},{"startMs":725320,"durationMs":3689,"subtitle":"Well, he also was very adept at his sister's"},{"startMs":729021,"durationMs":3619,"subtitle":"sewing machine, the only other member of the"},{"startMs":732640,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"family, other child of the family who was."},{"startMs":736960,"durationMs":6040,"subtitle":"And it's one of Stevenson's cases, one of the cases he investigated."},{"startMs":743000,"durationMs":3684,"subtitle":"And he learned on one occasion when a family"},{"startMs":746696,"durationMs":4024,"subtitle":"servant was having trouble threading the machine,"},{"startMs":750720,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"he was, you know, less than four, I think, at the time, pushed her out of the way

didn't"},{"startMs":772160,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"want training."},{"startMs":773160,"durationMs":2050,"subtitle":"He said he already knew how to sew, he

did."},{"startMs":778240,"durationMs":4280,"subtitle":"I mean, he would finish some of his older sister's work, you know."},{"startMs":782520,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"I see."},{"startMs":783520,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"Are there other such examples?"},{"startMs":788400,"durationMs":9920,"subtitle":"I think there's a Tlingit example of a boy who was very adept at

go ahead."},{"startMs":826520,"durationMs":3093,"subtitle":"Well, I gather, though, that the predominant"},{"startMs":829625,"durationMs":3175,"subtitle":"behavioral memory that comes up in these cases"},{"startMs":832800,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"would tend to be a phobia."},{"startMs":836400,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"I think that's fair to say,

died."},{"startMs":874480,"durationMs":7080,"subtitle":"So the phobia is related to the specific cause of death of the previous person."},{"startMs":881560,"durationMs":1000,"subtitle":"That's
