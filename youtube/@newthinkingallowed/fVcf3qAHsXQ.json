they"},{"startMs":1259148,"durationMs":2812,"subtitle":"disperse them at a safe level above the Grand Canyon."},{"startMs":1261960,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"But that was sort of the

his art, that was the American Visionary Art Museum."},{"startMs":1329560,"durationMs":2413,"subtitle":"And for his archives, they thought that

them."},{"startMs":1335080,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"And at that time, the University of West Georgia had a small humanistic program,"},{"startMs":1341160,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"of which

a good place."},{"startMs":1358040,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"And it was really just talking about the cosmic art files."},{"startMs":1361160,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"And they said, hey, do you have these other things, correspondence and research?"},{"startMs":1366280,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"We would love to have that too."},{"startMs":1367800,"durationMs":3237,"subtitle":"So we split up the art, went to the American"},{"startMs":1371049,"durationMs":2671,"subtitle":"Visionary Art Museum, certain pieces."},{"startMs":1373720,"durationMs":3333,"subtitle":"Well, I would say maybe his masterpieces, his"},{"startMs":1377065,"durationMs":3055,"subtitle":"partner in the building, his nephew bought"},{"startMs":1380120,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"everything else, his artwork and his furnishings and what have you."},{"startMs":1383880,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"And he's an owner of the Highline Hotel in New

can"},{"startMs":1394760,"durationMs":3068,"subtitle":"sit on Ingo's sofas and you can put your coffee"},{"startMs":1397840,"durationMs":2760,"subtitle":"on Ingo's side tables and you can sit under"},{"startMs":1400600,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"Ingo's other art, which I think is fabulous."},{"startMs":1404040,"durationMs":2748,"subtitle":"And then the University of West Georgia,

there."},{"startMs":1413560,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"And along with that, my mom wanted to make sure that the archives in general, because"},{"startMs":1419320,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"research was so important to Ingo."},{"startMs":1422360,"durationMs":3243,"subtitle":"And he says in Remote Viewing the Real Story"},{"startMs":1425615,"durationMs":3545,"subtitle":"that remote viewing was not something he created."},{"startMs":1429160,"durationMs":2708,"subtitle":"It was the work of hundreds of individuals,"},{"startMs":1431880,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"a lot of researchers and history before him."},{"startMs":1434600,"durationMs":3588,"subtitle":"And so my mom wanted to recognize that, that"},{"startMs":1438200,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"research is very important, that this is a"},{"startMs":1441560,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"valid experience, but wanted people to come down and use archives and do research."},{"startMs":1447560,"durationMs":2612,"subtitle":"And so started the Ingo Swan Fellowship,"},{"startMs":1450184,"durationMs":2816,"subtitle":"which is every other

other."},{"startMs":2433240,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"So, Ingo brought me up to her apartment, was way up on the Upper West Side."},{"startMs":2437960,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"And at the time, my husband, John, was a musician, so he had long hair and a goatee."},{"startMs":2444040,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"And here I was this little Vassar person."},{"startMs":2447000,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"And we took one look at each other, and we're like, oh, God."},{"startMs":2452600,"durationMs":2332,"subtitle":"Like, you thought this person would be like,"},{"startMs":2454944,"durationMs":2136,"subtitle":"I mean, we both did it, like looking, I'm"},{"startMs":2457080,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"looking at Uncle Ingo, and he's looking at his mom, like, what, what, what is this?"},{"startMs":2461080,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"So, they sent us out to the bodega to get something, you know, hoping this would like"},{"startMs":2466280,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"spark something."},{"startMs":2467320,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"And basically, we just figured out how we were going to come back and let them down."},{"startMs":2472040,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"That, you know, we appreciated the effort."},{"startMs":2474920,"durationMs":720,"subtitle":"Good job."},{"startMs":2475640,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"But, you know, it's not going to work out."},{"startMs":2478760,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"But, you know, Uncle Ingo was tenacious, and Sandra was equally as tenacious."},{"startMs":2484200,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"And they didn't give up."},{"startMs":2485400,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"And they, they bided their time."},{"startMs":2488440,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"And it was at her 50th birthday party."},{"startMs":2492040,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"So, maybe five years later."},{"startMs":2495560,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"And they just sort of were, it was a big party."},{"startMs":2498040,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And the two of them worked to sort of like corral us together."},{"startMs":2502520,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"And we got together, and I like to say it was love at second sight."},{"startMs":2506600,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"We just felt madly and deeply in love with each other."},{"startMs":2511400,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"That was the first weekend in November of 1996."},{"startMs":2517640,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"The

engaged."},{"startMs":2524040,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"So, once you got over the hurdle, things move very quickly."},{"startMs":2529720,"durationMs":320,"subtitle":"Yeah."},{"startMs":2530040,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"So, I guess Uncle Ingo really could see it was meant to be."},{"startMs":2532920,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"He just didn't get his timing right."},{"startMs":2538120,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"Well, can we talk about his artwork a little bit?"},{"startMs":2543160,"durationMs":480,"subtitle":"Sure."},{"startMs":2543640,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"So, it's very fascinating, his journey within his artwork."},{"startMs":2549640,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"So, when he first comes to New York, he says he's come to join the ranks of"},{"startMs":2557160,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"tens of thousands of other struggling artists in Manhattan."},{"startMs":2560520,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"And at the time, things are very surreal."},{"startMs":2563640,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"So, his paintings are probably one step up from hand drawing."},{"startMs":2567640,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"They're very black and white."},{"startMs":2570040,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"They're steam pipes and roads and buildings."},{"startMs":2575720,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"Very unimaginative."},{"startMs":2577160,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"But I think he's just probably getting his feet wet."},{"startMs":2580600,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"He starts to integrate a little bit of surrealism following Dali into his art."},{"startMs":2587240,"durationMs":8080,"subtitle":"So, the use of the eyes in unique kind of imagery or big figures, small figures."},{"startMs":2597000,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"But then he just gives up."},{"startMs":2598440,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"He just can't make inroads into selling any of his paintings."},{"startMs":2602440,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"He just throws up his hands and says, I'm just going to paint what I want to paint."},{"startMs":2606520,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"And he decides to paint very colorful paintings, very abstract paintings,"},{"startMs":2613240,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"starting with flowers, but mostly the lights that he sees around things."},{"startMs":2617720,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"So, his inspiration is sort of the auras or these energy fields"},{"startMs":2622200,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"that he's seen his whole life."},{"startMs":2624280,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"He decides to paint these."},{"startMs":2625800,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"And that series then leads him into what I would say,"},{"startMs":2632760,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"when he starts getting into all of his occult studies,"},{"startMs":2636680,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"his artwork sort of takes on that same kind of theme."},{"startMs":2639560,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"So, there are lots of symbolism of occult meanings in his paintings."},{"startMs":2645400,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"So, sort of this, what I would say is like this neutral,"},{"startMs":2649960,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"this kind of collapsing of the feminine and the masculine together."},{"startMs":2655080,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"So, we start to see figures of one half is good and one half is evil."},{"startMs":2661080,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"One half is male, one half is female."},{"startMs":2663640,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"So, a lot of that duality of energy start to happen."},{"startMs":2669800,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"And then sort of like more occult type of symbolism into the late 60s."},{"startMs":2675960,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"And then when he starts to do all of his work at ASPR, his out-of-body work at ASPR,"},{"startMs":2683720,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"and he's going into the realm of space sometimes."},{"startMs":2688600,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"And then, of course, all his work at SRI,"},{"startMs":2691160,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"and he's doing remote viewing of other planets."},{"startMs":2694680,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"He starts to paint these spacescapes, these exquisite journeys where he says,"},{"startMs":2700920,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"you know, space is not black or white."},{"startMs":2704280,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"It's gorgeous."},{"startMs":2705480,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"It's filled with color and exuberance."},{"startMs":2711000,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And he paints those wonderful spacescapes."},{"startMs":2714600,"durationMs":5438,"subtitle":"And then he says that he's got a triptych,"},{"startMs":2720050,"durationMs":5830,"subtitle":"which he calls Aft Ship's View of Sagittarius."},{"startMs":2725880,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"So, if one were in a spaceship looking out at the constellation Sagittarius,"},{"startMs":2730680,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"he names the stars."},{"startMs":2732440,"durationMs":5440,"subtitle":"He's got his highway series, which is the roads we travel on Earth,"},{"startMs":2737880,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"and then the roads we travel in space with our minds."},{"startMs":2741400,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"So, there's a highway going through space and a highway on the ground."},{"startMs":2745800,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"And then what he calls the cosmic egg."},{"startMs":2748760,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"So, the birth of the cosmos from an egg inside an egg."},{"startMs":2752600,"durationMs":6480,"subtitle":"And he reaches out, the Smithsonian is now building their Air and Space Museum."},{"startMs":2761880,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"And Ingo says, what a better place to dump my things than this museum."},{"startMs":2767080,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"So, that's how they came by three of Ingo's spacescape paintings."},{"startMs":2773240,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"And that's what he does through the 70s."},{"startMs":2776120,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"And then the 80s and into the 90s, it's really metaphysical symbolism."},{"startMs":2783240,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"And then, you know, a lot of UFOs, a lot of otherworldly vestiges, what have you."},{"startMs":2789000,"durationMs":480,"subtitle":"Let's see."},{"startMs":2789480,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"Is there anything else we haven't covered, Elly?"},{"startMs":2792840,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"For him, remote, you know, he's most identified, right, with remote viewing."},{"startMs":2799000,"durationMs":500,"subtitle":"Yes."},{"startMs":2800440,"durationMs":4046,"subtitle":"Because in his work, what was so important"},{"startMs":2804498,"durationMs":4342,"subtitle":"was he could establish the methodology, right?"},{"startMs":2808840,"durationMs":1680,"subtitle":"And I think that's your question, Scientology."},{"startMs":2810520,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"Scientology helped gave him a way to conceptualize the method,"},{"startMs":2818440,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"how you could teach remote viewing or the stages of remote viewing, right?"},{"startMs":2822840,"durationMs":2603,"subtitle":"Where you are still conscious and"},{"startMs":2825455,"durationMs":3385,"subtitle":"information is coming back to you in stages."},{"startMs":2830040,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"So, how to do that and then how to teach that."},{"startMs":2833000,"durationMs":3982,"subtitle":"But to him, remote viewing was just one of"},{"startMs":2836994,"durationMs":4086,"subtitle":"a constellation of interests and activities."},{"startMs":2841880,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"And when you kind of look at the whole playbook of Ingo Swann,"},{"startMs":2847400,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"it's much broader than just remote viewing, right?"},{"startMs":2850040,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"So, he believes that we all have these wonderful innate abilities."},{"startMs":2854920,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"You know, not everybody, you know, we can all throw a ball."},{"startMs":2858520,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"Not everybody's going to be a major league pitcher, right?"},{"startMs":2861720,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"But we have the ability to throw a ball to a certain extent."},{"startMs":2865320,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"And we just need to remember these marvelous attributes that we have."},{"startMs":2870680,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"And I think that's his greatest contribution to humanity is saying,"},{"startMs":2876760,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"let's wake up and remember these things because they're there inside of us."},{"startMs":2880680,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"What, you know, whatever, I mean, that is."},{"startMs":2882280,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"And instead of getting into this drama or soap opera about remote viewing,"},{"startMs":2887480,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"like somebody has so much to me,"},{"startMs":2890040,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"so much kind of infighting in the remote viewing world,"},{"startMs":2893480,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"where it's remote viewing is just one of so many extraordinary things that we have."},{"startMs":2898200,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"And how can we help each other to develop these things?"},{"startMs":2901400,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"And I think that's what Ingo was about."},{"startMs":2903800,"durationMs":3272,"subtitle":"He's about eliciting ways that we can attune"},{"startMs":2907084,"durationMs":3356,"subtitle":"ourselves to the greater natures that we have."},{"startMs":2911400,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"I think that's very clear from his artwork and his writing,"},{"startMs":2915800,"durationMs":4198,"subtitle":"that he was undoubtedly a proponent for people"},{"startMs":2920010,"durationMs":4030,"subtitle":"being able to see themselves in a larger way."},{"startMs":2924520,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"And yet, you know, from time to time, I hear from people, not a lot,"},{"startMs":2930200,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"but occasionally I hear from people and they know about this connection"},{"startMs":2934520,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"between remote viewing and the military."},{"startMs":2937400,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"And so many people, because for various reasons,"},{"startMs":2941880,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"they're hostile to the military or they're hostile to the government,"},{"startMs":2945960,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"it seems like it's a nefarious business, that there's something evil going on,"},{"startMs":2951800,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"that psychics would be working with the military."},{"startMs":2954680,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"And I wonder if any of that sort of flack came your way from people or Ingo's way?"},{"startMs":2964200,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"I think for looking at the time, right?"},{"startMs":2968280,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"The time is, it's the height of the Cold War, right?"},{"startMs":2974680,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"Very afraid of some sort of nuclear kind of catastrophe"},{"startMs":2980040,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"happening between the Soviets and the United States."},{"startMs":2983080,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"So you have to understand that sort of circling around."},{"startMs":2989080,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"You also recognize that there aren't really outlets other than parapsychology,"},{"startMs":2993880,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"which Ingo has kind of thrown up his hands at parapsychologists,"},{"startMs":2998280,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"because what happened at the ASPR is his results were nearly perfect."},{"startMs":3004600,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"And they said, it's not possible, it's simply not possible"},{"startMs":3007640,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"that somebody could be that good."},{"startMs":3009960,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"So they wouldn't even believe his results."},{"startMs":3012360,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"You couldn't really go to parapsychologists because,"},{"startMs":3016040,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"you know, they're afraid that it's going to be seen as fake, right?"},{"startMs":3018680,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"Because that's always been behind, you know, in the back of everybody's mind is,"},{"startMs":3023160,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"you know, are these people all fakes?"},{"startMs":3025240,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"You know, and a lot of them were, and there's some truth to that, right?"},{"startMs":3029720,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"So you have to get over, okay, parapsychology is not really believing me."},{"startMs":3033880,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"But the military, because they're so worried about the Soviets,"},{"startMs":3039560,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"and this is before we really have satellites that can drill in"},{"startMs":3042840,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"and see what's going on, right?"},{"startMs":3045240,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"We need to know what's going on over across on the other side of the world,"},{"startMs":3050840,"durationMs":4880,"subtitle":"but we don't have a means to see what's going on inside these facilities."},{"startMs":3056600,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"Other than people, you know, somebody on the ground an asset on the ground,"},{"startMs":3060200,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"an asset on the ground."},{"startMs":3061800,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"So the military is looking and saying, well, this could be beneficial."},{"startMs":3065480,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"And Ingo's always said he was a patriot, right?"},{"startMs":3068440,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"So he's, this is important work to him."},{"startMs":3073720,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"Because, you know, this is dire threat around."},{"startMs":3078440,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"And the only ones who are really investigating this,"},{"startMs":3081320,"durationMs":6080,"subtitle":"because parapsychologists are, you know, a little cautious."},{"startMs":3087400,"durationMs":3188,"subtitle":"So I think he's finding in the military"},{"startMs":3090600,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"sponsors who are willing to investigate this"},{"startMs":3094760,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"for reasons that could be beneficial to our national security."},{"startMs":3099000,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"So I guess you kind of have to kind of look at the historical mindset of this,"},{"startMs":3104840,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"that they're doing this for a greater purpose, right?"},{"startMs":3107320,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"And a lot of the sessions, he's having to remote view"},{"startMs":3114280,"durationMs":4402,"subtitle":"biological chemical experimenting facilities"},{"startMs":3118694,"durationMs":3826,"subtitle":"where they are experimenting on humans."},{"startMs":3123400,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"So he's having to remote view these."},{"startMs":3125800,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"And that, I think, took a tremendous toll on him."},{"startMs":3130920,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"So he's, when he's remote viewing, it's not like a TV screen where we think,"},{"startMs":3136440,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"okay, you know, it's like watching a movie."},{"startMs":3138840,"durationMs":1120,"subtitle":"He is there."},{"startMs":3139960,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"He is smelling."},{"startMs":3141480,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"He is feeling."},{"startMs":3142520,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"He is perceiving what is happening."},{"startMs":3145800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And you're looking at people being tortured."},{"startMs":3150520,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"That's a tremendous and overwhelming experience."},{"startMs":3156600,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"But the government's just trying to figure out, okay, well,"},{"startMs":3158680,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"we know there's this facility at this military base somewhere in Russia."},{"startMs":3163560,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"He's telling them what's going on, right?"},{"startMs":3165400,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"We need to know, are we going to be in danger?"},{"startMs":3168120,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"And what's the next danger that's going to come to us?"},{"startMs":3170840,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"So, yeah, from that perspective, he's, one, a patriot."},{"startMs":3178440,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"And two, it's somebody who's going to actually support his work."},{"startMs":3181160,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"I want to see it developed and appreciate the results."},{"startMs":3185000,"durationMs":800,"subtitle":"Let's put it that way."},{"startMs":3187400,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"Did he ever complain to you about the difficulty of doing that work?"},{"startMs":3192520,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"Well, I didn't even know that he did, right?"},{"startMs":3194600,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"So he took his top secret clearance very seriously."},{"startMs":3199480,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"So everybody asks us about remote viewing, even when my mom was alive,"},{"startMs":3204280,"durationMs":1360,"subtitle":"we really had no clue."},{"startMs":3205640,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"We just knew he was a psychic doing this kind of psychic work."},{"startMs":3212840,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"And ultimately, he didn't really discuss remote viewing with me."},{"startMs":3217080,"durationMs":3233,"subtitle":"Our time together was, he told me stories"},{"startMs":3220325,"durationMs":3555,"subtitle":"about his wild sexual adventures in the

passing."},{"startMs":3253320,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"He was born in 1933."},{"startMs":3256440,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"So I guess he died at the age of 80."},{"startMs":3261240,"durationMs":480,"subtitle":"Almost."},{"startMs":3261720,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"So he was born in September of 1933 and he passed away on January 31st of
