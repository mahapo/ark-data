practice."},{"startMs":514120,"durationMs":960,"subtitle":"Well, that's right, yes."},{"startMs":515080,"durationMs":1960,"subtitle":"And so you can say that there was some talent

her"},{"startMs":721040,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"how to thread the machine."},{"startMs":723120,"durationMs":2840,"subtitle":"So when you see something like

well"},{"startMs":1376080,"durationMs":3800,"subtitle":"be that in Western culture, we are"},{"startMs":1379880,"durationMs":3340,"subtitle":"more used to thinking in terms of survival"},{"startMs":1383220,"durationMs":1500,"subtitle":"without reincarnation."},{"startMs":1384720,"durationMs":6600,"subtitle":"So if I've just died and I'm in some sort of other

longer."},{"startMs":1414400,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"And that may indeed help explain the intermission length."},{"startMs":1417840,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"Now, one thing that's interesting"},{"startMs":1419280,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"is that it's known from the mediumistic literature"},{"startMs":1422720,"durationMs":3560,"subtitle":"that even the best communicators stop communicating"},{"startMs":1426280,"durationMs":1520,"subtitle":"after a few decades."},{"startMs":1427800,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"And that is precisely the time that we then"},{"startMs":1431080,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"see in the reincarnation cases, that it matches the interval."},{"startMs":1437400,"durationMs":3320,"subtitle":"So it does seem like in the West that perhaps we"},{"startMs":1440720,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"can explain the longer median intermissions,"},{"startMs":1444160,"durationMs":7680,"subtitle":"the longer typical intermissions on that basis,"},{"startMs":1451840,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"that people are taking longer to reincarnate in order"},{"startMs":1454840,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"to appear to their loved ones when they die"},{"startMs":1460200,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"and in order to communicate through mediums."},{"startMs":1463160,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"So the lesson that I get from this is that, first of all,"},{"startMs":1469800,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"survival as it's thought about in conventional Christian"},{"startMs":1473240,"durationMs":2360,"subtitle":"or Western terms is

think resurrection is the idea that, but perhaps not."},{"startMs":1492720,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"I mean, perhaps you could have several lives"},{"startMs":1495040,"durationMs":4960,"subtitle":"and then there can be a bodily resurrection at the end of it."},{"startMs":1500000,"durationMs":8760,"subtitle":"But at least, yeah, I mean, there"},{"startMs":1508760,"durationMs":5240,"subtitle":"can be a period of survival and stay in the afterlife"},{"startMs":1514000,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"before reincarnation."},{"startMs":1515440,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"And the other lesson I get from this"},{"startMs":1517680,"durationMs":4600,"subtitle":"is that these things are largely psychologically driven,"},{"startMs":1522280,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"that what people believe is likely to shape"},{"startMs":1527560,"durationMs":4680,"subtitle":"what actually, one might say, the progress of the soul"},{"startMs":1532240,"durationMs":2120,"subtitle":"is shaped by the beliefs of the soul."},{"startMs":1534360,"durationMs":3000,"subtitle":"Yes, and I think that's another very important insight."},{"startMs":1537360,"durationMs":5480,"subtitle":"I think that beliefs, expectations before we die"},{"startMs":1542840,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"probably have a lot to do with what happens after we die."},{"startMs":1547000,"durationMs":880,"subtitle":"And that makes sense."},{"startMs":1547880,"durationMs":2240,"subtitle":"I mean, if consciousness does continue,"},{"startMs":1550120,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"if the spirit of the mind continues,"},{"startMs":1552440,"durationMs":2920,"subtitle":"then it would be perfectly natural, I
