gone."},{"startMs":3549180,"durationMs":1440,"subtitle":"So I was like, what in the..."},{"startMs":3551340,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"You know, what is this that's happening to me that I'm picking up on people's pain?"},{"startMs":3556060,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"We were asked, Jim and I were asked to become part of this ghost busting

something."},{"startMs":3567100,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"So we went to this haunted house."},{"startMs":3569980,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And they asked if I would sit in the room where all the phenomena had been occurring."},{"startMs":3573980,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And if I would do a remote viewing session to kind of see what I picked up on."},{"startMs":3578060,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"So I was getting all this information that was later proved to be accurate."},{"startMs":3581420,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"But while I was sitting there, suddenly, I started developing a headache."},{"startMs":3585020,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"And the headache became overwhelming."},{"startMs":3586860,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"So

anything?"},{"startMs":3591740,"durationMs":1760,"subtitle":"And he said, why?"},{"startMs":3593500,"durationMs":2400,"subtitle":"And I said, I have a massive headache all of a

need the headache."},{"startMs":3620620,"durationMs":1120,"subtitle":"And instantly it was gone."},{"startMs":3622300,"durationMs":5280,"subtitle":"So I was realizing how this phenomena was something I had never experienced before."},{"startMs":3627580,"durationMs":2625,"subtitle":"And I didn't know if my involvement with CRV"},{"startMs":3630217,"durationMs":2403,"subtitle":"was just opening doors all over the place"},{"startMs":3632620,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"to where I was picking up on these things."},{"startMs":3634620,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"But this ties back into what

permeable."},{"startMs":3652620,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"So I've had to learn how to protect myself better and develop my own skin."},{"startMs":3659180,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"And I do believe that the lack of having your own skin,"},{"startMs":3662700,"durationMs":5760,"subtitle":"having those boundaries established also feeds back to childhood

picking up on everyone else's things"},{"startMs":3680620,"durationMs":2349,"subtitle":"because it has always been your responsibility"},{"startMs":3682981,"durationMs":1959,"subtitle":"to fix things

they're so empathic."},{"startMs":3695740,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"And so it takes skill to learn."},{"startMs":3698780,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"You have to really learn how to protect yourself"},{"startMs":3701660,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"so that you're not just taking on all that pain."},{"startMs":3704940,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"But you can watch it almost like when

happening, but you're impartial."},{"startMs":3722860,"durationMs":4080,"subtitle":"And it sounds cruel, but you have to become impartial and objective"},{"startMs":3726940,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"like a reporter reporting a war scene."},{"startMs":3730060,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"So the reporters are standing there, there's bombs going off behind them."},{"startMs":3733420,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"They can't freak out and start screaming."},{"startMs":3736300,"durationMs":2960,"subtitle":"They have to just be like, you know, reporting what's happening, right?"},{"startMs":3739260,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"And that's how remote viewers have to become."},{"startMs":3741340,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"We have to be objective observers."},{"startMs":3743500,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"We have to report what's happening without becoming emotionally involved in it."},{"startMs":3747900,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"And it takes, that's probably the greatest skill that a remote viewer has to develop."},{"startMs":3753740,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"You know, beyond everything else is that ability to report objectively."},{"startMs":3758220,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"Well, let's talk about the pain in your
