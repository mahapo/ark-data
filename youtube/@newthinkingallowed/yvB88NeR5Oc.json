the air wing"},{"startMs":370000,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"came into the SCIF where I work, and he said,"},{"startMs":375120,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"hey, I've got something to show you, you know?"},{"startMs":377680,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"And so, I sat down at my computer and I pulled it up,"},{"startMs":381920,"durationMs":5520,"subtitle":"and we all kind of just gathered around the computer and watched these clips."},{"startMs":388880,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"And so, that was the first time I saw it."},{"startMs":393440,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"And later, of

discussing it, and I kind"},{"startMs":408289,"durationMs":2111,"subtitle":"of threw my head down at the floor and just"},{"startMs":411440,"durationMs":1120,"subtitle":"walked right past them."},{"startMs":414560,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"I didn't want to hear that conversation, you know?"},{"startMs":417040,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"It may be part of recurring theme, which we're going to address today,"},{"startMs":420080,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"is that sometimes people just don't want to hear some of these things."},{"startMs":423200,"durationMs":2160,"subtitle":"Maybe that's what you were going through."},{"startMs":425360,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"Because didn't you say that you had an emotional reaction to this"},{"startMs":428400,"durationMs":1840,"subtitle":"when you were examining the footage?"},{"startMs":431040,"durationMs":720,"subtitle":"Yes, I did."},{"startMs":433600,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"And I didn't understand it at the time, but I kind of, I did."},{"startMs":437360,"durationMs":3280,"subtitle":"I had a very emotional reaction to it."},{"startMs":440640,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"I could kind of feel tears welling up in my eyes as I'm watching this footage."},{"startMs":447600,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"And I didn't understand it, and I watched the footage obsessively,"},{"startMs":453840,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"you know, for the next several months."},{"startMs":456320,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"To the point that people would come into the shop where I work,"},{"startMs":461520,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"and they saw it, they would see me watching it again,"},{"startMs":464960,"durationMs":2000,"subtitle":"and they're like, oh, are you watching that again?"},{"startMs":467760,"durationMs":1600,"subtitle":"You know, what is wrong with you?"},{"startMs":470160,"durationMs":2562,"subtitle":"And I would just say, how do you not think this"},{"startMs":472734,"durationMs":2466,"subtitle":"is the most incredible thing you've ever seen?"},{"startMs":476880,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"It reminds me of that scene in Close Encounters where Richard Dreyfuss,"},{"startMs":480480,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"once he's seen the event, he has to look at it over and over again."},{"startMs":485200,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"He becomes obsessed in some ways."},{"startMs":487280,"durationMs":2080,"subtitle":"I'm not saying that this is a one-on-one with you,"},{"startMs":489360,"durationMs":4320,"subtitle":"but in some ways that is part of the obsession, right?"},{"startMs":493680,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"This is so otherworldly, so important, so galvanizing"},{"startMs":497360,"durationMs":2320,"subtitle":"that you can't look away once you do start looking."},{"startMs":500400,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"Yes, absolutely."},{"startMs":501600,"durationMs":6400,"subtitle":"I would say that the people who made Close Encounters"},{"startMs":508400,"durationMs":3774,"subtitle":"knew that about this subject, and so the character"},{"startMs":512186,"durationMs":3414,"subtitle":"that Richard Dreyfuss plays resembles a lot of"},{"startMs":515600,"durationMs":3120,"subtitle":"people who end up looking into this."},{"startMs":518720,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"It becomes an obsession, you know, and you just can't take yourself away from it."},{"startMs":527520,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"And of course, many of those people have secondary and tertiary encounters,"},{"startMs":531920,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"and we're going to get into that to your personal story as well."},{"startMs":536240,"durationMs":7120,"subtitle":"But what I have to say, you know, that you have also said that you don't believe"},{"startMs":544000,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"that this is the only footage that the United States government has."},{"startMs":547440,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"And I know, again, recently, Congress, I don't want to say has been forced,"},{"startMs":551440,"durationMs":2468,"subtitle":"but maybe their hand has been pushed to the"},{"startMs":553920,"durationMs":2480,"subtitle":"point that they had to release some footage."},{"startMs":556400,"durationMs":2880,"subtitle":"But you say there's a lot more, and it's a lot more definitive."},{"startMs":560720,"durationMs":320,"subtitle":"Yes."},{"startMs":561520,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"To the degree you can divulge this."},{"startMs":564960,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"I understand you're under some restrictions, even though you retired Navy."},{"startMs":568480,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"Nevertheless, you have gone on the record by saying"},{"startMs":572240,"durationMs":3040,"subtitle":"you wish they'd show some of the more definitive footage."},{"startMs":576080,"durationMs":5120,"subtitle":"Yeah, I mean, there are things out there that if the public were to see it,"},{"startMs":581200,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"there'd be no doubt as to what this is."},{"startMs":586640,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"I know it's interesting because what you demonstrate, again, in the Gimbal footage,"},{"startMs":590880,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"it's still pretty mind bending."},{"startMs":594640,"durationMs":5040,"subtitle":"And it still is something that, as you describe in that clip,"},{"startMs":600720,"durationMs":2800,"subtitle":"no rudders, no tails, no exhaust, no nothing."},{"startMs":603520,"durationMs":2720,"subtitle":"So that still seems pretty convincing."},{"startMs":606240,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"But I guess what you're saying is there's even more convincing definitive evidence"},{"startMs":609840,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"that if I were to see it or my colleagues were to see it, we'd say, OK, no doubt."},{"startMs":614640,"durationMs":1280,"subtitle":"Yes, absolutely."},{"startMs":615920,"durationMs":3840,"subtitle":"I mean, because the footage that has been released thus far,"},{"startMs":619760,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"a lot of it is just very ambiguous, right?"},{"startMs":625120,"durationMs":3440,"subtitle":"You look at it and you say, well, that could be a balloon."},{"startMs":628560,"durationMs":2640,"subtitle":"It could be a piece of floating debris."},{"startMs":631200,"durationMs":4480,"subtitle":"But if you were to see it moving in some anomalous way,"},{"startMs":636720,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"some way that aircraft don't move, which these things certainly exist."},{"startMs":643360,"durationMs":4400,"subtitle":"So if you were to see that, it would kind of take away that ambiguity."},{"startMs":648320,"durationMs":3920,"subtitle":"So when the crew, or at least the people you're working with on the Roosevelt,"},{"startMs":652240,"durationMs":3680,"subtitle":"start to discover this footage, is it business as usual?"},{"startMs":655920,"durationMs":3520,"subtitle":"Or do some people start getting attached to it like you had?"},{"startMs":660400,"durationMs":3200,"subtitle":"For everyone else, it was just kind of business as usual."},{"startMs":664800,"durationMs":4000,"subtitle":"Every once in a while, someone would bring it up and we would start talking about it."},{"startMs":670800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"But for the most part, everyone just kind of put it away."},{"startMs":674960,"durationMs":3600,"subtitle":"But you pursued it in 2015, is when this occurs."},{"startMs":678560,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"And by 2017, the New York Times now starts to divulge some of the information,"},{"startMs":684160,"durationMs":3360,"subtitle":"some of the information that had been, let's face it, let's just speak frankly,"},{"startMs":687520,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"had been hidden, top secret, classified for years."},{"startMs":692320,"durationMs":1200,"subtitle":"Yes,

But there's more to come."},{"startMs":707760,"durationMs":1040,"subtitle":"Yeah, hopefully."},{"startMs":708800,"durationMs":3760,"subtitle":"Well, you would think inevitably a lot more of this is going to come out,"},{"startMs":712560,"durationMs":2560,"subtitle":"even though it's been so many years."},{"startMs":715840,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"I just have to show you this quick clip
