And beside it there were two"},{"startMs":2086400,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"meditation halls. One was called Extraordinary Eyes.

Suddenly everybody"},{"startMs":2100080,"durationMs":6720,"subtitle":"sang, go to Extraordinary Eyes, go to Extraordinary Eyes. And so I didn't know where that was, but I"},{"startMs":2106800,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"just started following everyone. And before I knew it, I found myself sitting in the back of a big"},{"startMs":2113680,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"hall. It was like a cathedral. Actually it was called the cathedral at that time. I may get my"},{"startMs":2121200,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"terms and names and words and places mixed up, just because I'm a bit older. But I'm remembering,"},{"startMs":2129120,"durationMs":8160,"subtitle":"actually this was called the cathedral at the time. Yes. And when I walked into this room,"},{"startMs":2137280,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"it felt enormous. Obviously it had a shape to it, but it felt enormous. I sat down in the room,"},{"startMs":2145040,"durationMs":10480,"subtitle":"and then soon after that Adi Da came walking from the back of the hall, and he took his seat"},{"startMs":2156320,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"in the front of the hall. His seat was slightly raised a bit so that everyone at the way back of"},{"startMs":2161680,"durationMs":6880,"subtitle":"the room could see him. So he was on what we call the dais, where his seat, everybody was able to"},{"startMs":2168560,"durationMs":9440,"subtitle":"view him. And as he sat down, suddenly what I began to see was that everything around me"},{"startMs":2178880,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"became like a peripheral view, even if it was somebody close next to me. And it kind of faded"},{"startMs":2184560,"durationMs":10480,"subtitle":"into a, it was fused with light at the same time, as if there was gentle rain coming down. And then"},{"startMs":2195040,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"my vision became extremely focused on his physical body. And when that occurred, I started to see"},{"startMs":2202480,"durationMs":10800,"subtitle":"visions of icons from what I know to be now the great tradition. Like I saw Jesus, I saw Buddha,"},{"startMs":2214800,"durationMs":8640,"subtitle":"I saw sages, I saw deities of different kinds.

He was called Baba, which meant friend."},{"startMs":2230800,"durationMs":4800,"subtitle":"I was seeing all of this pass before me, and at the same time I was just fully fell into"},{"startMs":2236320,"durationMs":8480,"subtitle":"this extraordinary vision.

And at that point in time, it didn't"},{"startMs":2264560,"durationMs":7600,"subtitle":"have anything to do with him as a man, not at that point. It was just the extraordinary"},{"startMs":2273120,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"nature of being drawn into a divine process that was extremely,"},{"startMs":2281920,"durationMs":9280,"subtitle":"stopped my mind. So how did you follow up at that point? So then I stayed on retreat"},{"startMs":2291200,"durationMs":9840,"subtitle":"on the sanctuary, and what occurred is the day later, there was another gathering that was going"},{"startMs":2301280,"durationMs":9600,"subtitle":"to happen. And I began to be curious about Adi Da's life at that point. I started asking questions"},{"startMs":2310880,"durationMs":8240,"subtitle":"of the devotees who had been around a lot longer. And there was a gathering where he again began to"},{"startMs":2319120,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"speak in the cathedral again, about the consideration that he calls divine ignorance,"},{"startMs":2327760,"durationMs":7440,"subtitle":"which means that while the mind may want to know the truth, truth can only be experienced,"},{"startMs":2336880,"durationMs":5840,"subtitle":"wholly experienced in the heart and with the whole bodily being. And it would be something"},{"startMs":2342720,"durationMs":8720,"subtitle":"that would be mutually felt by everyone and everything in the room and beyond. And so the"},{"startMs":2351440,"durationMs":9760,"subtitle":"mind falls away. And so that's, we do not know what it is. We do not know what anything is"},{"startMs":2361200,"durationMs":6000,"subtitle":"in truth, as truth. There's that profound consideration about divine ignorance, and it"},{"startMs":2367200,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"relieves you of any search or seeking for what it is through experience and knowledge, but it's a"},{"startMs":2374160,"durationMs":5600,"subtitle":"falling into that divine ignorance. So he was speaking about this. And as he was doing it,"},{"startMs":2379760,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"I noticed that there were men and women around him who were taking care of them in different ways."},{"startMs":2385440,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"Like it was hot, so it was fanning. It was mid-July. So he was being fanned by a couple women or men,"},{"startMs":2392960,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"and then he would be bringing some, being brought something if he needed something. And I noticed"},{"startMs":2397680,"durationMs":8000,"subtitle":"that, well, what's this about? He's being served in some way. Why? And so I started asking questions."},{"startMs":2406320,"durationMs":6960,"subtitle":"Well, unknown to me, my questions began to be brought back to him. In other words, there was"},{"startMs":2413280,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"a curiosity about him as a human being that he knew that I was interested in. So I was invited"},{"startMs":2420320,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"to another type of gathering that took place. And I was invited to what was called the King's Room."},{"startMs":2426640,"durationMs":5200,"subtitle":"Now the King's Room was a room that was downstairs. It was almost like underground,"},{"startMs":2432480,"durationMs":5680,"subtitle":"because it was beneath a building called Great Food Dish. Now you've been on the sanctuary,"},{"startMs":2438160,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"so some of these buildings, if I was to describe where they were, you might remember them a bit."},{"startMs":2443920,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"But it was a building where the kitchen was. And then there was another hall there, and it was"},{"startMs":2448640,"durationMs":5360,"subtitle":"next to his private residence. And downstairs, underneath that, there was a room that was called"},{"startMs":2454000,"durationMs":8480,"subtitle":"the King's Room. So I was actually invited to go to this gathering. And this was the first gathering"},{"startMs":2462480,"durationMs":7040,"subtitle":"where I actually participated with him. And we were using accessories, which meant that people"},{"startMs":2469520,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"were drinking beer, and some were smoking cigarettes. And of course, to me, it's like,"},{"startMs":2474320,"durationMs":6560,"subtitle":"really? What does this have to do with spiritual life and practice? Even though I had known that"},{"startMs":2480880,"durationMs":4160,"subtitle":"this was occurring because of what I read, I didn't think that was going to be happening."},{"startMs":2485840,"durationMs":6320,"subtitle":"But I walked into the room, and in the middle of the room, there was a pool table. So that was"},{"startMs":2492160,"durationMs":4720,"subtitle":"another thing that was interesting. And in the room, it was this incredibly interesting kind of"},{"startMs":2496880,"durationMs":8800,"subtitle":"deep maroon carpet. And a lot of three sides of the room actually had big wood stones. It was made"},{"startMs":2505680,"durationMs":4560,"subtitle":"out of stones, you know, so it was literally underground. And then the front of it was large"},{"startMs":2510240,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"glass. So I came in, and I sat down, and I was there with devotees, and I was drinking and enjoying"},{"startMs":2516400,"durationMs":6240,"subtitle":"having conversation. And there was an anticipation again in the air and excitement that Adi Da would"},{"startMs":2522640,"durationMs":9360,"subtitle":"be, Baba would be arriving soon. So when he came into the room, he was wearing a Indian type"},{"startMs":2532960,"durationMs":10960,"subtitle":"a silk shirt and silk pants that was extraordinarily brilliant yellow color, and a v-neck long sleeve."},{"startMs":2543920,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"And when he walked into that room, and I saw him, I fell in love with him as a man."},{"startMs":2553280,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"In addition to what I had experienced spiritually in terms of what's described as his transmission,"},{"startMs":2562000,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"or Shaktipat, the energy that was coming from his being, everybody transmits his particular form of"},{"startMs":2569920,"durationMs":9200,"subtitle":"transmission is extremely strong.

So in that moment, I actually"},{"startMs":2585520,"durationMs":7760,"subtitle":"fell in love with him as a man. And I began to notice that, and of course, I didn't know"},{"startMs":2593280,"durationMs":4240,"subtitle":"what to think of that, but that's just what happened for me. And when I feel it, you know,"},{"startMs":2597520,"durationMs":7840,"subtitle":"I feel the depth of that love, you know, that depth of that emotion of falling in love and the"},{"startMs":2605360,"durationMs":8400,"subtitle":"extraordinary situation I found myself in that was so unexpected, completely unexpected, and not"},{"startMs":2613840,"durationMs":7920,"subtitle":"anticipated at all.

So there's a respect that is"},{"startMs":2644320,"durationMs":4640,"subtitle":"being acknowledged when he comes in the room. And of course, the first thing that he does,"},{"startMs":2649600,"durationMs":6160,"subtitle":"is he makes a joke.

And that was something he was really often engaged with and in bringing humor"},{"startMs":2681840,"durationMs":7520,"subtitle":"into our life with him and with one another. And then he started to play pool. And he played pool"},{"startMs":2689360,"durationMs":6640,"subtitle":"with a couple of the male devotees on yellow, one of the very earliest devotees.
