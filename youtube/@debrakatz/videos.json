Jon Knowles, Debra Katz, & Eric Schöne.","description":"Jon Knowles, M.A., and Debra Lynne Katz, Ph.D. interviewed Eric Schöne, Ph.D.,  who has claimed to be getting consistently strong results after reading their recent book \"Associative Remote Viewing: The Art of Science of Predicting Future Outcomes for Sports-betting, Finances, Elections and the Lottery\". He states that tightening up protocols for strengthening the proper feedback and time loops while eliminating exposure to other elements that can lead to psi displacement has raised the stats, which is in alignment with our feelings about how to achieve better results. Theories around what leads to better predictions when using this remote viewing system are discussed, including the idea that some events are more solidified in time than others, especially when they are not easily subject to changes of decisions through receipt of intuitive-based knowledge. They also discuss preferred target types, wagering decisions and behaviors, remote viewing approaches, gender-based preferences, challenges, length of session, burn-out, motivations, the lotto, tuning into letters and numbers, the joys and sorrows of this work & other compelling topics related to the science and application of remote viewing. (Follow-up note from Debra: It should be noted that to date we have not been shown evidence of the longer-term stats discussed in this interview, so this interview should not be construed as verification but rather hopeful optimism that the numbers do reflect the claims. We believe all claims of stats should be easily verified and provided for such verification).","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHz6BoN_gF0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHz6BoN_gF0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHz6BoN_gF0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHz6BoN_gF0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHz6BoN_gF0/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QHz6BoN_gF0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tVkjT7yRk2cjDhfW27pxWkT-7Zc","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLnJSZ3BnT29EaUlB","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2023-07-11T22:15:57Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"PsiFest2023 IRVA Monroe Conference Video Promo","description":"Join us for the event of the year in Charlottesville, Virginia, August 10-13, and online.

He is next known as the father of remote viewing and trainer of a handful of former military remote viewers who have gone onto train generations of remote viewers. Yet few understand the level in which he 1). Was a scientist who advanced the research at SRI and elsewhere in ways that were never revealed in the formal research but are clearly present in his archives; 2). Was someone who did have many exceptional experiences growing up but who worked relentlessly to understand and develop these further so as to make use of them. He did this through the aid of not other trained instructors but through having the great fortune of meeting many researchers along the way who didn't necessarily have the answers but were willing to work with him to adjust and try out new protocols, in the true spirt of science and collaboration. In this presentation guest speakers were invited who also have interacted with Ingos archives. Debra Lynne Katz spent 3 years at University of West Georgia, while going for her Ph.D studying his archives, after having studied with his various students and their students for many years.

The Bengston Energy Healing Method is a powerful, safe energy therapy that according to a combination of documented peer reviewed studies combined with testimony from a number of individuals, produces remarkable results for both people and animals with a variety of physical and emotional disorders, including depression, Alzheimer’s, digestive disorder, cataracts, cancer and more.\n\nIn 2008, he published “Can Healing Be Taught?” in Explore: The Journal of Science and Medicine. His work on “A Method Used to Train Skeptical Volunteers to Heal in an Experimental Setting” and “Resonance, Placebo Effects, and Type II Errors: Some Implications from Healing Research for Experimental Methods,” was published by The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2007.  In addition, his book, The Energy Cure has been translated into four languages.\n\nKrishanti and Debra will be sponsoring a healing class taught by Dr. Benston which will be held in early August 2020. Krishanti has taken his classes for 3 years, Debra has not taken his classes but has heard presentations about his research at various scientific conferences.\n\n\nNOTE: The International School of Clairvoyance & Debra Lynne Katz believe that energy healing should always be carried out in conjunction with all possible modalities and under the care of a licensed medical physician. While we are sponsoring this workshop and very excited about the possibilities that this method offers (or we would not be sponsoring it) the views expressed by any workshop leaders are not necessarily the views of the school. We have seen negative results of clients who have failed to make use of treatments recommended by licensed medical professionals. This had nothing to do with the above healing modality but feel it would only be responsible to state that all methods of treatment, including chemo, radiation and surgery are part of God's work as much as is energy healing. We believe both together can make a difference. Energy healing has less side effects for sure then other alternatives, but doesn't always work for a variety of reasons and should not be the only option under most circumstances.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCT7-0h1NSw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCT7-0h1NSw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCT7-0h1NSw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCT7-0h1NSw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BCT7-0h1NSw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":14,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"BCT7-0h1NSw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"lMtHyvvqQNcEP-dLkPNI0qotm_8","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLjRoWHBnbXlRbm9v","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-04-30T08:44:40Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"MaestroConference Break Out Groups Training","description":"This training is specifically for the facilitators of the International School of Clairvoyance.

Russell, Debra and Michelle are all in agreement that everyone has intuitive gifts and they just have to often have some additional assistance with bringing these out and honing them. He spent hundreds of hours \"interviewing\" both subjects like Ingo Swann and Pat Price who were already identified as having psychic talent, and then so many others like Hella Hammid along with U.S. senators, generals, scientists, etc., who didn't know they had these abilities.

She demonstrates why archival research is so exciting, and how it gives even more of an intimate look into a person of interests life then even their own auto-biography can, as its not just about them but all others they communicated with and the society they lived within at the time. Archival research is an interdisciplinary form of social science research as it is archeological, sociological and psychological. It gives insights into someone's life who has passed that just can not be gained elsewhere, especially if their entire body of work has been donated as has the legendary psychic-artist-author-researcher and research subject Ingo Swann.

These interviews get to the meat of the topics, (even down to the bones!) discussing issues you won't hear anywhere else because the guests aren't interested in starting at the beginning of their work/careers but instead discussing the issues they are most passionate about from where they are NOW, on \"the other side of the curve\". Daz Smith is editor of Eight Martini's Magazine and author of \"Surfing the Psychic Internet\"; \"Controlled Remote Viewing\" and Remote Viewing Dialogues\". (www.remoteviewed.com). He runs some of the largest remote viewing and UFO websites on the internet. Edward Riordan has demonstrated how remote viewing is an art as much as it is an information gathering tool through offering thousands of hours of free on camera demonstrations through his own You Tube Page (www.erviewer.com). Debra Lynne Katz is the Director of the International School of Clairvoyance and author of \"You Are Psychic\"; \"Extraordinary Psychic\" and \"Freeing the Genie Within\" - as well as a film school graduate and former host of Sedona, Arizona's  \"The Psychic Explorer\" television show. Topics in this 1.45 minute pilot episode include: Remote viewing is an art not just an outcome; Daz Smith's participation in compelling and controversial video projects hosted by the Farsight institute (including how he was tasked with Hitler and JFK at the very same time);  issues around ownership of one's remote viewing sessions and creative works; Ingo Swann and the controversy over is training/monitoring necessary and helpful in remote viewing practice; and why aren't psychologists or other scientists more interested in the inner workings of a remote viewer's/psychic's mind and practices?!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyglpcuNmiE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyglpcuNmiE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyglpcuNmiE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyglpcuNmiE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":31,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"lyglpcuNmiE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"EhqHsKpAYBq0QjKcy9kGEIe7Bpo","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLndVV0p5NUtpemZN","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-01-09T06:11:02Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"Magic, Miracles & Manifesting for 2016 Pajama Power Party Webinar!1452218786","description":"Kick off the new year with 12 awesome speakers guiding your through powerful transformation goal setting, frequency raising vibrations, with your host, author & Master Alchemist Debra Lynne Katz of the International School of Clairvoyance.

Webinar Recording","description":"Debra Lynne Katz, in partnership with the Applied Precognition Project and the ISC, leads a motivational and education webinar to a group of 20 individuals for the purpose of encouraging those who are already engaged in remote viewing related projects, and specifically those involving repeated trials performed under double blind conditions, to turn their projects into formal scientific studies.  The presentation includes sharing of several remote viewer's sketches with exceptional matches to their feedback photos. Topics such as \"guerrilla research\", what one needs to do prior to the start of a study, why people without Ph.D's are afraid to take their projects to the next level and how to overcome one' limitations which could be real or imagined. Present day resources such as researchers willing to help, organizations that will do proposal reviews, parapsychology related publications, how to approach the experts were also covered. Also, a poll of prominent parapsychologists was conducted specifically for this event and responses from the experts are included as well.  For a copy of the powerpoint presentation in PDF format, please visit Debra's website where you will find it under the blog post. Or you can download it here (please return for it later).

(1954-2011).","description":"In 2010 or so I was part of a spiritual film group,  that had been started by Amanda Robinson called ISE-LA. There I met some wonderful filmmakers and actors including those in this film. (I may have met a couple also through the Elevate Film Festival Writer's Group in Los Angeles too). ISE-LA had just a bit of funding and I was fortunate to have one of my films selected (Bending Spoons). One of my fellow group members was the sweetest guy named James Cremin. He actually convinced his mother to open up her Hollywood Hills home and to leave town so we could film there, and he took the flack when we moved just about every nick nack and piece of furniture, forgetting exactly where they were all supposed to go when we had to put it all back. James embodied the aspiring filmmaker. He had actually grown up in Hollywood and he lived and breathed film and screenwriting, being an active member of several groups. While he was always reading his work during various writers workshops (He was also an active member of the Alemeda Writer's Group). He had not had any of his scripts produced or optioned. When James came down with Cancer, I decided it was time that changed. At first we sought funding and help from some other groups that he had been a part of (since our original group ISELA had disbanded) but when it looked like that wasn't happening I called up the members of this cast and said, \"To hell with it, we don't need funding. Let's just do it\". And so we did. The plan was originally to have James direct, but on the scheduled day of filmming (which we had to do in secret at a park without a permit, which wasn't easy given we had several extras as marathon runners) James was too weak from Chemo. Still, he stayed with us out in the hot sun for an entire day, clearly suffering in silence, so he could be part of the production and we did what we could to consult with him where possible. In the end, we found a professional editor willing to edit for peanuts. James wasn't thrilled that we (the editor and myself) had cut down some of his script - it was just too wordy - but we kept the story intact. His script was about his own relationship with his father (Gary Weinberg, plays James' character) and he was pretty emotionally attached. I felt bad because this whole project was done to help him realize his dream of having a script produced, and yet sometimes it's hard for a writer to let go of extra dialog that just slows down the story and it's even harder for the rest of the team to not want to tighten it up.  We drifted apart after that and I set the files aside, waiting to hear what James wanted to do with the film. A few years passed in fact. A month ago or so I e-mailed James but didn't hear back. I did some research and found that he had passed away in 2011. His cancer had been in remission but it did come back. I was glad to see that James had made a documentary about helping others recover from Cancer in the time when we had been out of touch. It is called, \"VIsions For Wellness\".  James touched many lives and he was a genuinely good guy. I always felt happy to see him and he always seemed so grateful to be part of a group. He was the kind of guy that was just comfortable to be around. Kind of quirky, kind of nerdy, but passionate and knowledgeable about the subjects he loved. He was definitely the teddy bear, huggable type. He never had a wife or kids and perhaps not too many girl friends either, but he had lots of friends and people who adored him. I will always feel inspirited by James' passion for doing what he loved, even when he faced rejection and all sorts of things that we filmmakers and writers all go through. This is his story and his film. Not perfect, but pretty good considering the circumstances.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8AcWLYDEk8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8AcWLYDEk8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8AcWLYDEk8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8AcWLYDEk8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8AcWLYDEk8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":35,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"H8AcWLYDEk8"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"fQ_muFenfQ3n6EcJRXQxuZ0KTZQ","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLm1lVG5HdW1IS0pv","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-08-25T22:00:55Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"Empath-telepath: shared pain, emotions, sexual arousal:recognizing & handling it.","description":"EMPATH CLASS/LESSON  Author Debra Lynne Katz demonstrates how intuitive/unconscious processing of other people's pain, emotions, thoughts, sexual arousal and sharing of morphic energetic fields can be informative and useful, but also destructive and difficult to handle.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/meTnGumHKJo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/meTnGumHKJo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/meTnGumHKJo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/meTnGumHKJo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":36,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"meTnGumHKJo"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"XhbjQRaiV65znSQL9lVdGi9_dMg","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLkxjS01ueC1XS280","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-02-19T10:00:46Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"KATZ LADIES ALL ABOUT THE BASS","description":"Happy Birthday to my sister, Amy Katz, Mother, Nedra Katz, Step Mother, Dotty, and myself - all Feb Birthdays.

Join us for a sunset drive through the Mojave desert after a rare and welcome rain.  Experience what lies just beyond our backyard in Phelan, California, as we witness miles and miles of endless illegal dumping.  This is America folks, not a third world country! Hard to believe.    We've reported this to the police, we've called the code enforcement people, Phelan is unincorporated so there is no city officials to talk to.   As long as people have to pay for trash in rural areas where they can't afford it or don't care, this will continue. It's not just here but all over the deserts of California. Please help us contact our city officials in San Bernardino County (recently declared Bankruptcy) or state officials. This location begins just a couple hundred yards from the California Aquaduct where county workers drive by all the time! This may very well be where you all get your drinking water from if you live in California!  It's located in between Sheep Creek and Johnson Roads, starting at Luna and we only drove within a couple mile radius.  I shot this film using my Iphone (3G) and edited it using final cut and 3 versions of the same song. I'm calling it \"Desert Tears\" because I couldn't help but cry as we were filmming because even when I envisioned this project, I didn't realize how bad it was out there until tonight.  Also, the title is in reference to the Don't Litter Ads from the 1980's with the Native American shedding a tear as he steps in the same kind of mess we come across while enjoying the great outdoors. The saddest thing is not much has changed since then, at least not here.  This was completely shot on my IPHONE.                                             www.debrakatz.com  - UPDATE AS OF FEB 4th 2016 - GOOD News! This just arrived in my inbox in a newsletter from the county:\n\n:Six months after San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Robert A. Lovingood launched an inmate work crew initiative, more than 100 tons of trash and tires have been collected in High Desert communities. Inmate and county work crews cleared 131 parcels, collecting 94.5 tons of trash and 1,980 tires within the First District.\n   Lovingood gave special thanks to San Bernardino County Code Enforcement Director Andy Wingert and Code Enforcement Supervisor Ignacio Nunez for their work on the on-going project.\n   San Bernardino County Code Enforcement has a smart phone app that makes it easy to make illegal dumping, graffiti and other code enforcement reports in unincorporated areas. The app is available for the iPhone and Droid by searching “SB Code.”","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R9fQS0bZwHw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R9fQS0bZwHw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R9fQS0bZwHw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":42,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"R9fQS0bZwHw"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"hZ-mDCsYhiXoURdA--Cp5dg227o","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLlZnSTJ6RjdPWkdF","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2012-07-06T18:16:34Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"The Maiden and the Mime - Debra Lynne Katz - Mystery/Suspense/love story","description":"This is a quirky,  suspenseful love story/mystery filmed at over 18 different locations in Sedona, Arizona where I lived and attended the Zaki Gordon Institute for Indy filmmaking.

So This is a selection of scenes from the first television show I created and hosted that appeared on both The Arizona Channel and Geronimo TV, in Sedona, Arizona from 1999 to about 2002.  The show was called  \"The Psychic Explorer: Adventures of the Spirit\".  The show featured a variety of guests who discussed subjects related to the paranormal and metaphysical.  Guests included musician/chanter Krishna Das, Kazandra Martin, Rachel Mai, D.S. Baron, Tomas, several Tibetian Monks, Anodea Judith, various UFO researchers. Also it featured my own twin sister and my infant son, Manny Katz, (who is now turning 21) was featured in the opening credits of each show. This was prior to the release of my first book, You Are Psychic, at a time when I was just starting to teach clairvoyant reading and healing classes. This program is what motivated me to go to film school and also take broadcasting classes, as I wanted to make sure myfuture shows would have a higher production value and I'd learn how to present in a more polished way.

To see their responses visit www.sevethsight.org and look at blog post \"target 222222\".  \n\nOK HERE IS THE FEEDBACK!\n\nThe Target was a hiking/fishing expedition/day out to a wilderness area (not too far from some hotsprings, this is near Apple Valley, CA., not too far from the Cajon Pass, southern Califronia, where there are very large rocks, rock retaining walls lining the path (built by people long ago), mountainous area, deserty but with lots of desert vegetation and streams running all along. We had to climb over large boulder to get to the water, where there was sand and waterfalls.  There was myself, Danny, our friend Tony who look like Crockodile Dundee in his kakee clothes and my 13 year old son. The guys were fishing.  Tony was smoking something when no one was looking.  Our dogs, Artemis, a white husky and Tony's very large tan dog were with us.  To get to the area we parked, walked down a very long path, hiked in an hour or so and then reached the water where we fished, napped and ate some food from our backpacks.  We were all very happy to be out, but I was somewhat anxious about not wanting myself or others to get hurt.  Also, I was feeling a little ignored as the guys had made bets as to who would catch more fish and they were more focused on that then hanging out with me.  We don't get out much so all of us were very happy. This is near a canyon type area, so as you walk along and up from the water you see a vast wilderness area.  There is sometimes military exercises that go on in the area too.  There were campers and other hikers we passed, although we were not near a camping area, on the other side of the mountain there is at least one camp ground.  So depending on whether you were viewing from way up high or close you would have gotten a different perspective. Important things to get for this target:, people, water,land/water interface, fishing, sunny, warm day, outside, rocky, mountainous area, desert like but also vegetation, emotional states.\n\nAssigned by Debra Lynne Katz, author of YOU ARE PSYCHIC, EXTRAORDINARY PSYCHIC AND FREEING THE GENIE WITHIN (www.urpsychic.com).","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHDnIpZ2BKE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHDnIpZ2BKE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHDnIpZ2BKE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":48,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"YHDnIpZ2BKE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"rsMvJj2fF3tOfyhirjniZjMFuc0","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLldfdk1MZFZ4VmMw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-09-03T00:43:34Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"August 2, 2012 El cahon pass fire near 15, taken at 5 pm","description":"Fire right now seen from downtown  phelan where we live","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_vMLdVxVc0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_vMLdVxVc0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_vMLdVxVc0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_vMLdVxVc0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Debra Katz","playlistId":"UUfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","position":49,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"W_vMLdVxVc0"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Debra Katz","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"-g0_1P7Jn0aBOMZp7TrxvUCzBzQ","id":"VVVmekZJZW0wcTRMa0lOV3VZUGlfU0JnLmZYSmpGa1kyVmVV","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2011-08-26T20:16:14Z","channelId":"UCfzFIem0q4LkINWuYPi_SBg","title":"UFO PANEL on CNN,  Aug 24 2011 - PART 2","description":"PART II - FINALLY - A great panel on CNN discussing UFO's and disclosure and why the U.S. government doesn't want to admit there is something flying around their airspace that they can't control.

In this video, I make the case that the credit score is a weapon utilized by individuals and companies who have found a legitimate way to charge millions of citizens who are already experiencing tough times and are underprivileged even more money or even deny them essential services such as housing, utilities, insurance, jobs, etc.  These are the same citizens that are supposedly protected under the laws that make it a criminal offense to overcharge and deny services on the basis on race, religion, gender, etc.  (notice, I'm calling them \"citizens\" and not \"consumers\" as economists love to call us.  Consumers is such a horrid word!! The credit score is deadly to one's spirit because it reduces us to  number and makes people live in fear and shame when they choose to pay for their housing, food and medical care (and their children's) instead of their credit card debt.  Most people aren't seeking to purchase items without paying for them.  Most people these days know the evils of credit cards but are faced with the fact they can't raise their score unless they agree to get a card and put themselves into debt. If they can't raise their score, they are denied a place to rent, a rental car, a mortgage, even basic utility services or auto insurance or a job.   This constitutes extortion!  And no one is talking about this or very few are because most are too busy playing the game. And now, not only are citizens victimized by these reporting agencies that dictate the experiences of hundreds of millions of citizens, but the US government is facing losing it's AAA status and the value of the dollar hinges on whether or not the all mighty and powerful reporting agency of S & P decides to stick it to  Obama, or show some mercy.  The US government is being told to lower it's debt or else.  How to do this?  Tax the American People or take away their benefits, because after all, why do lazy folks like us need government handouts like social security and medicare when we are elderly?  Better take these away so we can make sure the guys on wall street get their bonuses.  Nevermind that is how the US got their debt, by bailing them out after they scammed us.  All cynicism aside, this talk is about empowering people to let go of the shame and put the blame where it's due.  At this same time, this talk demonstrates that even with everything working against us, we can still excel and achieve our dreams, no matter what our score. This is the first video in a series on the subject.  Please spread the word.  Many people you know are suffering from this shame game.  If you are one of the ones who has a good or great score, then all the more power to you.  This isn't saying people shouldn't be held accountable.  But this is not the way to do it.  It's a system gone haywire.\r\n\r\nThis is the precursor to a groundbreaking documentary and book that I am currently working on.  I promise the real documentary will not just be me talking!  I'm currently seeking funding for this project as well as an agent/publisher for this particular book.
