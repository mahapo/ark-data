insurance covers amalgam.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And the composite is a
little more expensive.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.178 align:middle line:90%
heavy metals would do this.

00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And mercury was one
of them I put in.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
I had no concern

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
about amalgam fillings, anything
regarding mercury toxicity.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And the results were dramatic.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Phenomenal data
that came out was

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that mercury and
only mercury would

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
cause the same
biochemical abnormalities

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
as you saw in
Alzheimer's disease

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
using our technology
for evaluating

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
the activity of certain enzymes.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
the problem changed.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It was no longer a scientific
problem that I ran into.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:90%
That was easy.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I could do that.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:90%
The problem was political.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
When I tried to get funded to
look at mercury as a neurotoxin

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and its possibilities of
contributing to Alzheimer's

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:90%
disease, they shut me down.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.728 align:middle line:84%
My grants were just
totally rejected.

00:08:18.728 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said
something to the effect

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Doc Haley has to
realize we don't

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.445 align:middle line:84%
need to see any more of
these kinds of studies.

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, I have
never gotten another NIH grant.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:90%
And that was soul destroying.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I had been funded for 20
some years of doing research.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
I couldn't get a grant.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I had no money to
run my laboratories.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I just
walked off a cliff

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and was hanging onto
that last branch.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was devastated.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And Sandy helped
me through that.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
When I first wrote
in those grants,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking to
Sandy about how important I

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:90%
thought they were.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Sandy is a good sounding
board, gives good advice.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And she helped me accept the
fact that my ideas were not

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.167 align:middle line:84%

Dr. Goldberg is

worked for, I would say,
about seven years, my last job

that I had before I got sick.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, even though we
don't agree on the issue,

From his education
and knowledge,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:84%
he has a difference of opinion
about what made me sick.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't say
that I'm not sick.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And he respects me.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.492 align:middle line:84%

my activism that I'm doing.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had blurred
vision in one eye.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
weird ringing in my ear.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I would be in a
conversation with someone,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and there's like this,
[BUZZING] in my ear,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
while I'm trying
to talk to someone.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest effect was
these deep, deep headaches.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were so deep, I
mean, deep, deep down in my--

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.803 align:middle line:90%
like in my brain.

00:15:15.803 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But when I would
go to the doctor,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and they would tell me all of
these possibilities of what

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
it could be, then that
would kind of make me feel,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.795 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is probably in my head.

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a culmination
of all those things together.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to be fine.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.098 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to ignore this.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So I would just go on about
my business and think,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're right, they're
right, they're right,

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:90%
and I'm wrong.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:90%
This must be in my head.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:90%
This must be in my head.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It was in my head.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It was in my teeth.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.115 align:middle line:84%
So I kept believing
them, letting

00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
it get worse and
worse and worse,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.876 align:middle line:84%

up and couldn't walk.

We were sitting in her car.

00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:90%
But I asked her to marry me.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I told her what
my goal was, was

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to go get a PhD in
chemistry and it

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
was going to be tough for
about four or five years,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going
to make a lot of money.

Sometimes, he's
gone once a month.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
He has sacrificed a lot in the

He doesn't do this
for monetary reasons.

to the cause.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%

that dental amalgams
were releasing

toxic amounts of mercury is
The International Academy

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of Oral Medicine and
Toxicology, because they

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
thought it was causing
a lot of medical damage.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And they were right.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I agree with them now.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't at the time.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
FDA nor the ADA

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
would allow anyone
to put something

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in the mouths of citizens that
released so much mercury vapor

I've given up a huge number
of my weekends with my family

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to go to meetings, because
this is a message that

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.283 align:middle line:84%
has to get out, that the
amalgams are toxic to people

00:18:48.283 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:84%

lot of problems.

Like my husband said,
you know, most people

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
don't know about
mercury poisoning.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't know anyone else
with mercury poisoning.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't read
about it in the news.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:90%
They don't hear about it.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So even though I have it,
they don't really understand.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they assume-- they
see me, I'm on my feet

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:90%

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%

FDA says it's safe.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:90%
The ADA really says it's safe.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%

how I could be sick from it

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:90%

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make them work.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It was beyond frightening.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I'd

out what was going on.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I called my husband, and
I said, honey, I can't walk.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.378 align:middle line:84%
I was home alone, and I knew
the kids were about to get up.

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:16.183 align:middle line:90%

I'm not going to be able

And the same doctor who
had been telling me it

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.247 align:middle line:84%
could be all these other things
and same doctor this day,

00:21:25.247 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:84%
after she ran a
couple of tests on me,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
she said just kind

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
well, you've either got
MS or a brain tumor.

And we'll get right on this.

00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my husband I both
looked at each other thinking,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
did we just hear what
we think we just heard.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been coming to you for
three or four months telling

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
you something's
wrong, and you're

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:90%
telling me everything's fine.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And now, you tell me I
have a brain tumor or MS?

00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
From there, we went
to see an MS doctor.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And he ran a bunch of
tests and came back

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and said, at this
point, we're going

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.577 align:middle line:84%
to hold off on treating
you with any MS medication,

00:22:04.577 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:84%
because we want to see you
back in six months just

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
to kind of see where
things are and kind of get

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
a better feel of how your body's
going to react to this disease.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, I am in tears.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Would you please give
me these MS shots,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84%
give me something,
slow this thing down?

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm raising babies.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:90%
I need you to stop this train.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't give
me any medicine.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.857 align:middle line:84%
And now looking back, that was
basically the hand of God just

00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
interceding right at
that moment and saying,

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
just hold on, hold on, just
wait, there's something better.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.419 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Matthew Young.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a general dentist here in
Hendersonville, North Carolina.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been here at this
location for 29 years.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I was a traditional dentist
for about 10 or 12 years

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and then found out about
the dangers of mercury

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and other dental materials.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So we became mercury-free, not
putting in any mercury amalgam

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:90%
fillings.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when I discovered
The International Academy

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of Oral Medicine and Toxicology,
then I became mercury-safe.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
What that means is we use
special protective engineering

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
controls for OSHA to reduce
the exposure of our employees

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and our patients to
the mercury vapor

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
when the old mercury
fillings are removed.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.522 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been
out here at Dr.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Young's office this week
installing a multipoint mercury

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
monitoring system that
continuously and sequentially

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:84%
measures from eight different
sample points throughout as his

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:90%
dental office.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of our other
clients that deal with mercury

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.487 align:middle line:84%
are required by OSHA and EPA
to measure their facility

00:23:36.487 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day to make
sure that their employees are

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
below the ceiling
limit, which is

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
100 micrograms per cubic meter.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Young has taken
a major step here

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
by being the first
dentist that I'm aware of

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
to install a multipoint
mercury monitoring

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.795 align:middle line:90%
system into his office.

00:23:50.795 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:84%
He's doing everything
that he can

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to keep his employees and
himself as well as his patients

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
save during normal
procedures that

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.645 align:middle line:84%
have to do with dental
mercury amalgam fillings.

00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:03.643 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was what the
OSHA regulation requires,

00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
is that the dentist is aware
of how much mercury is in his

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
office, that the employees
are educated about it.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a heavy metal
chapter in our OSHA handbook

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that the employees have
to read and understand.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And they have to wear
special protective gear,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:90%
so it keeps off their skin.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
allowed to breathe it.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And our machine keeps track
of how clean the air is here

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.962 align:middle line:84%
in order to stay below
these dangerous levels.

00:24:25.962 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's incumbent
ethically upon the dentist

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of those risks and
to also monitor and educate

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.475 align:middle line:90%
their employees every day.

00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:37.463 align:middle line:90%

00:24:37.463 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I just flew in
from Santiago, Chile,

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
where I gave a presentation
to a group of legislators

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and researchers down there.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow, I give a talk
to The International Academy

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:84%
of Oral Medicine and
Toxicology on how

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:84%
mercury causes some of the
biochemical abnormalities

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that we see in some of
the neurological diseases

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:90%
such as Alzheimer's disease.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.822 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.822 --> 00:25:22.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Haley is a
research scientist,

00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
an international lecturer,
is a former chairman

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
of the department of chemistry
at the University of Kentucky.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
He has numerous research studies
published in peer reviewed,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:90%
medical scientific journals.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.143 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome to the
program Dr. Boyd Haley.

00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:37.035 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.873 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Mercury and only mercury
causes the break down and deep

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
polymerization of tubulin
off of the neurofibril,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
producing
neurofibrillary tangles,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
which is the hallmark
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
published studies

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly show that the
widespread exposure of mercury

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and its effects on the brain
explains every single aspect

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It is the missing
piece of the puzzle

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that's been literally right
under the noses of researchers

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:90%
for all these years

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Metal amalgams release many,
many micrograms of mercury per

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
day into our bodies.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So you not only have a toxin
that can do the effect,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
you have it placed within
inches of your brain.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And how do you get
that across to people?

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And I think I do a decent job.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.484 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I'm not
so sure it's adequate.

00:26:39.484 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
they want my slides.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who asked for
them, have my slides.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
You give my talk, I don't care.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.558 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not information
that's secretive or anything.

00:26:48.558 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It's something that should be
out there for everybody to use.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.519 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:57.974 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:57.974 --> 00:27:02.393 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.393 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Here I was with six months
to do nothing but wait and get

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.483 align:middle line:90%
worse.

00:27:07.483 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
what else do I have to do

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
but maybe try to look
into this and figure out

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:90%
where all this came from.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The very next Sunday at
church, a guy in our classes

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
said, you know,
my brother treats

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
people who've been
diagnosed with MS.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
He treats them for heavy
metal toxicity related

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
to their fillings.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't
know much about it.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But I know that he's
had some success.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about
there's mercury or something

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:90%
in these fillings.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.785 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you
have any of those?

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, yeah,
I just got four new ones,

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and I have four old
ones on this side.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
That was my first glimmer
of hope, the first moment

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that I had been told anything
that even remotely sounded

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
like there might be some sort
of hope out there for me.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I could not believe I didn't
know that there was mercury

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
in these silver fillings.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.625 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, well,
this has to be a lie.

00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I think the majority
of people still

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
do not know what these dentists
are putting in their mouth

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and in the mouths
of their children.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:24.973 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.973 --> 00:28:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>> According to a 2006
nationwide Zogby poll,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
76% of consumers did not know
mercury was the main component

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:90%
of dental amalgam fillings.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But once informed,
92% of respondents

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
thought their dentist should
be required to inform them

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
about mercury and
non-mercury dental fillings

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:90%
prior to treatment.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
dentists are not aware

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that under the learned
intermediary doctrine,

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
health care
practitioners are bound

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:84%
by law to pass along
manufacturer warnings

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:90%
to patients.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that's
not being done.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's worse
than you think.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.305 align:middle line:90%
It's prohibited.

00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Regrettably, the American
Dental Association has

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a provision in its code of
ethics to stop dentists from

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
initiating communications
with patients about the risk

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
of mercury dental fillings.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:84%
This what I call gag
rule has unfortunately

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
been enforced by many
dentist-dominated state

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:90%
dental boards.

the Pennsylvania Coalition

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:90%
for Mercury-Free Dentistry.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
to patients going in

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:90%
to get free dental care.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And we were letting
them know they

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
were eligible to get a white
filling for no extra cost.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.256 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
safer for them.

00:29:54.256 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the dentists that
came out and dental assistants

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:84%
were putting their
eyes up in the air,

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
like they were aggravated
that we would come and talk

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:90%
to the patients like this.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I wish
somebody told me

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was breathing in
all these toxic fumes.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And these people in the
school that are being trained,

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:90%
they have no idea.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't remember
when I didn't enjoy fishing.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my granddad was a person
who liked to fish quite a bit

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and took me quite often.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It's always been a
major relaxation for me.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Went to graduate
school, we ate a lot

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of what I either caught
fishing, my wife and I,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
or what I shot bird
hunting with my dogs.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Catching fish was a
supplement to our diet.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And since we didn't
have a lot of money,

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
eating a fish was
probably better

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
than a lot we could buy
in the grocery store.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a big, big difference.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of sad that
today the kids are told--

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
everyone's told, don't
eat too many of the fish,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:90%
they're too toxic with mercury.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
There are fish advisories in
about almost all the water

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I think it's sad.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Why go fish, if you can't
eat the fish you're catching.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You're catching something
that's toxic, why--

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:84%
it just takes the romance and
the livelihoodness out of it.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
should do everything

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
we can to get our water
and air clean again.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
That means we have to
stop all kinds of mercury.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.822 align:middle line:90%
We can't blame just one group.

00:32:02.822 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that-- things that
you can do something about,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
like dental amalgams,
that should be done.

Environment Programme reports

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that 10% of global mercury usage
is for amalgam tooth fillings.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
This results in up to 340
tons of dental mercury

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
journeying into the
environment each year.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:84%

of elemental mercury.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
This accounts for roughly 32
tons of mercury used yearly

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to place amalgam
restorations, otherwise known

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:90%
as silver fillings.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Although the number
of amalgams placed

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
has decreased over
the last few decades,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:84%
dentists still use amalgam
without precautions.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%

exposure continues.

for separating different
forms of mercury.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.210 align:middle line:84%
We use that now in
clinical testing

to look at how different forms
of mercury go into the body

We've run about

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, most
mainstream dentists

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:84%
don't come to me to
look for testing.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
They're taught that there
is no mercury exposure.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the only
guys that I look at

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:84%
are the mercury-free
dentists, which means

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:90%
they're only removing amalgam.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They're not placing it.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And they even stick out
from the regular population

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:90%
as having higher mercury levels.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So if these guys, who are
taking every step they

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
can to lower all of their
occupational exposure,

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:84%

that they're required to
distribute their product.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But the warning essentially said
that mercury is a neurotoxin.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was at least
arguable that all the things

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that Kerr was warning
about happened to Burns.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So Kerr's position was,
this is a dangerous product.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.682 align:middle line:84%
We told you it's a
dangerous product.

00:39:02.682 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And the case ought
to be dismissed,

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
adequately warned.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, a little history here.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
When dentists go
to dental school,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
they're taught that mixed dental
amalgam is completely inert.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when a dentist goes in
to grind out an amalgam filling,

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.752 align:middle line:84%
he is creating
tremendous quantities

00:39:16.752 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:90%
of mercury particulate.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The particulate is bound to the
other constituents of amalgam.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But Burns was absorbing
tremendous amounts, thousands

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of micrograms of mercury a
day, and ultimately began

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to suffer a very
predictable consequence.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Back to our case, Kerr tells
us it's warning is adequate.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:90%
We say, no, it's not.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of the
mercury going into a system

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is from this mixed
dental amalgam.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
anyone argued with that.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So is the warning adequate
if it only tells them

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:90%
that mercury is poisonous?

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:middle line:84%
To my surprise,
the district report

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:90%
said, yeah, it is adequate.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The manufacturer didn't say
that the poisonous mercury would

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:54.300 align:middle line:84%
be any less poisonous when mixed
with the other dental amalgam

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.250 align:middle line:90%
constituents.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The appellate court
in a published opinion

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:84%
also felt that the
adequacy of the warning

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
was such that Burns was
or should have been aware

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that mixed dental amalgam
was completely poisonous.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.592 align:middle line:90%

>> I had been pushed by the
FDA, American Dental Association

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:84%
as somebody that's on
the lunatic fringe.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And what's lunatic
about, the fact

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that somebody is putting
a most toxic metal known

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.765 align:middle line:84%
to man in your mouth,
and I'm saying,

00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:32.265 align:middle line:84%
hey, we really need
to look at this.

00:40:32.265 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
This may be the cause
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:90%
We have to do something.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.075 align:middle line:84%
We have to come up with
something that's very dramatic.

00:40:40.075 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I am going to visualize the
mercury vapor rolling off

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of these amalgams when
you put a drill on them

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
or when you abrade
them in any way.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.550 align:middle line:84%
This will leave no
doubt in people's mind

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of mercury
coming out of dental amalgams,

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.460 align:middle line:84%
when you put them in,
when you take them out.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm very optimistic
this may change

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:84%
the entire attitude of the
American Dental Association.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.388 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.388 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Boyd Haley coming from
University of Kentucky up

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
at Lexington.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to help us
to put the box together,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.645 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to
visualize the mercury vapor.

00:41:16.645 --> 00:41:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the first smoking
tooth video shows a 25-year-old

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:90%
amalgam from an extract a tooth.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And they put it in front
of the mercury lamp,

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can see exactly how
much mercury is vaporizing off

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:90%
the filling.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
When you see this for the
first time, it's quite a shock

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to see the amount of
mercury and the volume

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.117 align:middle line:84%
that your patients are either
breathing or swallowing.

00:41:37.117 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I
knew that I wasn't going

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:40.033 align:middle line:90%
to place anymore amalgams.

00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And when I remove them, I
was going to do it safely.

00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I just think the
best thing to do

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:49.668 align:middle line:84%
is to keep in mind that our
ethical creed is to do no harm.

00:41:49.668 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest
inflection from anybody

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:84%
who first joins
the IAOMT is you're

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.020 align:middle line:84%
going to have to talk
to the same patients

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that you just put the mercury
fillings in maybe a year ago,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
two years ago, and tell
them that you've learned

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:90%
this new information about it.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.178 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to come to
terms in your own ethics,

00:42:06.178 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in your own heart as to how
you're going to communicate

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that and how you're
going to present that

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to patients without feeling
like you're contradicting

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.260 align:middle line:90%
your previous work.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:84%
The most beautiful part
about the whole transition

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.947 align:middle line:84%
is that your patient loyalty
really blooms tremendously,

00:42:20.947 --> 00:42:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because it seems like
the patients know more

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:84%
about this than the
traditional dentist do.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
We're finding out that
mercury's been taking out

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other medicines and
other industries in the world.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's soon
going to be removed

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:84%
from dentistry, according to
the UN treaty in 2013, we hope.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:40.451 align:middle line:84%
So when the times change,
it's wise to change with them.

00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a difference
between someone coming in here

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and being concerned about the
safety of the amalgam and after

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.858 align:middle line:84%
me educating a patient,
who's a lay person,

00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:51.400 align:middle line:84%
who's not in the profession and
may just have heard something

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.650 align:middle line:84%
from a fairly uneducated
journalist about this,

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that I will-- after
that discussion,

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.850 align:middle line:84%
they still feel that they
would like them removed,

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.406 align:middle line:84%
I might consider
doing it for them.

00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, this is going
to be a lot of money.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.990 align:middle line:90%
It sounds crazy, looks crazy.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And if this works, why
isn't everybody doing it?

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And where are we going to
find the money to do this?

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.302 align:middle line:84%
And what if it
doesn't work and we've

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.120 align:middle line:84%
poured all this money
down the drain, then

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and
I talked about it,

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:84%
prayed about it
over several weeks.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we decided that we needed to
get these fillings out and just

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.510 align:middle line:90%
see what happened.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And that was $10,000.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a real hard time
with is when you have doctors

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
espousing removals
of dental amalgams,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.435 align:middle line:84%
because they believe that some
systemic illness is the cause

00:43:45.435 --> 00:43:46.235 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:43:46.235 --> 00:43:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And within a week of getting
the silver fillings out,

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.052 align:middle line:84%
the mercury out of my
mouth, I was 50% better.

00:43:54.052 --> 00:43:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The science is
not very convincing.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you can find people
with these conditions

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.125 align:middle line:84%
without dental amalgams
in their mouths.

00:44:03.125 --> 00:44:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The dental industry promotes
a stance that on its surface

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.330 align:middle line:90%
seems simple and adequate.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It says that if she
got sick from mercury,

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.760 align:middle line:84%
then all the dental assistants
would be sick for mercury,

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:84%
all the dentists be sick from
mercury, but they're not.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you really understand the
complexities of biochemistry,

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.080 align:middle line:84%
genetics, and genetic
susceptibility,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that that's really
a flawed scientific stance.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Lead will increase the
toxicity of a known amount

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.415 align:middle line:90%
of mercury over 100-fold.

00:44:34.415 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when people say,
well, we can look at people

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have enough
mercury to be mercury toxic,

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:84%
well, I would say,
you're not that smart.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what
the lead concentration is

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:90%
in that person.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Every human body has
a genetic predisposition

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.665 align:middle line:84%
to handle toxicity
a certain way.

00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
so frustrating,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:84%
is they just feel
like they can dismiss

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.830 align:middle line:84%
all of this information,
and all of these studies,

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of the stories
like mine of people being

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.630 align:middle line:84%
cured because not everybody who
has amalgam fillings get sick.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a very strong
biological reason for this.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down to the
individual's susceptibility.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Most of this is
genetic susceptibility.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Certain people will get sick,
will have symptoms at much

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.052 align:middle line:84%
lower levels of exposure
than other people.

00:45:25.052 --> 00:45:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I personally
would not do is,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.570 align:middle line:84%
if somebody came in with, say,
multiple sclerosis and said I

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:84%
heard that if I remove all these
dental fillings my multiple

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
sclerosis is going to go
away, I won't do that.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I will tell them that I
do not believe that that

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.260 align:middle line:90%
is the science at all.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not convinced of it
and that I would perhaps

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.650 align:middle line:84%
be doing more harm to
them than good in trying

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:90%
to remove these things.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:46:00.255 align:middle line:90%


00:46:00.255 --> 00:46:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Dental amalgam has been used
in dentistry for over 150 years

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and was grandfathered into
use by the Food and Drug

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Administration.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, the
product was not classified.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
In 1976, Congress
passed a law mandating

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that the FDA classify
all products which had

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.270 align:middle line:90%
been grandfathered into use.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:84%
After 33 years of ignoring
the congressional mandate

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to classify amalgam
fillings, the FDA was sued.

>> Charlie Brown, National
Council Consumers for Dental

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Choice, our mission is to ban
the use of mercury-based dental

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.540 align:middle line:84%
fillings known incorrectly
as silver fillings.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And we sought a court order
to order FDA to classify.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The judge Ellen Huvelle
said that's enough.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.090 align:middle line:90%
You go into mediation.

You come back here
a week from Monday.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And you tell me what date you're
going to classify amalgam,

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.705 align:middle line:90%
said that to FDA.

is again going to look

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:84%

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.190 align:middle line:90%
already have.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The fillings in question
are the silver kind.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And the concern here is
mercury, which is an ingredient.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The American Dental Association
insists the fillings are safe,

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.140 align:middle line:84%
but many people believe
the mercury can lead

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:90%
to serious health problems.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:16.725 align:middle line:90%

In the beginning, it was hard
for him to understand this too.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky that Nick
went to a health conference

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and a holistic
dentist was there.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.610 align:middle line:90%
And he lectured.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And then my husband came home
and took his retirement money

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
out, so that I
could get chelation.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time
that I got the chelation.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So yes, he's been
really supportive,

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.190 align:middle line:90%

He's strong emotionally.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.630 align:middle line:84%
He just kept encouraging
me and telling me,

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.080 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be OK.

that is mercury vapor coming

This is a really
inexpensive experiment

can't be repeated.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:58.376 align:middle line:84%
laboratories that you can't
deny what it's measuring.

Dr. Matt Young and I are
going to make this box

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:90%

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Matty.

Thanks for coming.

My pleasure.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.140 align:middle line:90%
It's mercury vapor.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't see it
in the daylight.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you breathe it, you can't
taste it, you can't smell it.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
hoping is that when

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:38.100 align:middle line:84%
we make visuals showing this
mercury vapor rolling off

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of these amalgams when you put a
drill on them, that the dentist

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.150 align:middle line:84%
will all of a sudden, oh, my
god, these guys aren't lying.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
mercury coming off.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.160 align:middle line:90%
We can visually show it.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is an approach that's
been developed by chemists,

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.790 align:middle line:90%
who activate a mercury lamp.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.230 align:middle line:84%
A mercury lamp is a lamp
that contains mercury vapor

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that you run a current through.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that mercury emits a
light of a special wavelength

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that water and air
will not absorb.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.520 align:middle line:84%
However, if you place
in front of that lamp

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:84%
an amalgam in a tooth and
you activate that tooth

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.560 align:middle line:84%
by brushing it, then
millions and millions

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.380 align:middle line:84%
of atoms of mercury
come off of that tooth.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
When the atom of mercury
gets in between the screen

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and the lamp, it absorbs that
photon and blocks that light.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
there is a shadow made

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.430 align:middle line:84%
on the screen where the
mercury is absorbing the light.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
is really an absorbance

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of the photon by
the mercury atom

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.816 align:middle line:84%
that reflects as a
shadow on the screen.

00:52:34.816 --> 00:52:38.225 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition, there's a lot
of skeptics out there that think

00:52:38.225 --> 00:52:40.600 align:middle line:84%
this is water vapor coming
off the teeth and not actually

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.560 align:middle line:90%
mercury.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.210 align:middle line:84%
We want to prove
once and for all

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually mercury
vapor that's coming off.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.268 align:middle line:84%
We also have a hole in the
top of the box with which we

00:52:49.268 --> 00:52:50.185 align:middle line:90%
will insert our probe.

00:52:50.185 --> 00:52:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
go to the mercury 3,000

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.482 align:middle line:90%
mass spectrophotometer.

00:52:54.482 --> 00:52:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to go
into the top of the box

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.650 align:middle line:84%
like this, so that a sample of
the air during these procedures

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.378 align:middle line:90%
can be measured accurately.

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:07.323 align:middle line:90%

take the oath, Senator?

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:90%

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
To me, this means
operating an agency that

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:46.180 align:middle line:90%
is accessible and transparent.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.630 align:middle line:84%
The FDA has responsibility to

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> During her
confirmation hearing,

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.630 align:middle line:84%
she was asked of her
position on dental amalgam.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:08.088 align:middle line:84%
>> She's asked about the rule
in the Senate confirmation.

00:54:08.088 --> 00:54:10.130 align:middle line:84%
She should have said, I'm
recused from that rule.

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Instead she didn't.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Hamburg failed to
disclose to Senator Enzi that

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.290 align:middle line:84%
she was a board member
of Henry Schein,

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.800 align:middle line:84%
the largest distributor
of amalgam in the US.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.630 align:middle line:84%
After her appointment
was confirmed,

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hamburg inherited the
oversight of the amalgam rule

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.360 align:middle line:90%
already in progress at the FDA.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Hamburg had a conflict that
should have resulted in her

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.060 align:middle line:90%
dismissal as commissioner.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They made her sign an
ethics contract that said,

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I will not participate
in any matter affecting

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:41.545 align:middle line:84%
Henry Schein as long as I own
the stock or stock options.

00:54:41.545 --> 00:54:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So she checked the price
of her stock options

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.003 align:middle line:84%
a day before the
meeting that she knew

00:54:45.003 --> 00:54:46.510 align:middle line:90%
was being held, July 1.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.540 align:middle line:84%
She had the meeting to discuss
the amalgam rule with Susan

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Runner and other top FDA staff.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.280 align:middle line:84%
She went ahead and worked
on the Henry Schein rule

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.870 align:middle line:84%
while she owned
the stock options.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.630 align:middle line:84%
In mid July, she said,
OK, I'll recuse myself

00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:59.980 align:middle line:90%
for ethical reasons.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:84%
She will not disclose
how she recused herself,

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.500 align:middle line:84%
when she recused herself,
whether she recused herself.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.792 align:middle line:90%
We take their word for it.

00:55:06.792 --> 00:55:09.250 align:middle line:84%
You understand, a recusal is
normally a written phenomenon.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The judge says,
I'm off this case.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The commissioner says,
I'm off this case.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:14.770 align:middle line:90%
She never wrote down anything.

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.398 align:middle line:84%
Hamburg in the final
weeks before the rule,

00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:18.940 align:middle line:84%
wrote Henry Schein's
lawyer and said,

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I want to unrecuse myself.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Will you take back
the stock options?

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.805 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back in
and regulate for you.

00:55:24.805 --> 00:55:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to regulate for you.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I want it in my recusal
of anything affecting you,

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:31.898 align:middle line:84%
so I can go back, take
my stock options back.

00:55:31.898 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And the guy was happy to do it.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:37.672 align:middle line:90%

>> I knew from my research that
getting the fillings out alone

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.310 align:middle line:84%
was not enough, because the
mercury from the fillings is

00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:50.800 align:middle line:90%

just let me know.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:28.410 align:middle line:84%

I can already feel
my body's calm down.

It's not as agitated.

But I'm good, I can
live with what I've got.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.950 align:middle line:84%

to do anything else,

if I'm not supposed to go
get chelation or pursue

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.440 align:middle line:90%

that doctor's hand and just

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.570 align:middle line:90%
went with it.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I am seeing an
osteopathic doctor,

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
began intravenous
chelation of EDTA and DMPS.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.173 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like chemotherapy.

01:02:10.173 --> 01:02:11.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's like.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
You get an injection,
you get an IV,

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and you just kind of sit
there for a couple of hours.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
big bag of liquid

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.885 align:middle line:90%
being poured into your body.

01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's frightening.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I made it through the
whole day, and I felt normal.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I slept great
and woke up the next day,

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well,
OK, I survived it.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.772 align:middle line:90%
There must be something to this.

01:02:30.772 --> 01:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Then I went back for my next
treatment the next week.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
feeling so much better.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just had like
an extra kick in my step.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK, I'm
onto something here.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And each treatment
just reinforced

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
what I had researched in.

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it may not
work for everybody.

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certainly not
saying that it will.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there's something

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.470 align:middle line:90%
to be said of starting early.

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
In my case, we
arrested it early.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.063 align:middle line:84%
We arrested it, contained
it, stopped it, and I'm good.

01:02:58.063 --> 01:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
people who've been sick

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:00.647 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

01:03:00.647 --> 01:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
reverse damage if it's

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.840 align:middle line:90%
been going on for a long time.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%
I definitely felt vindicated.

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think I told
my husband that.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I feel
so vindicated.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, now, I mean, look
at me, I'm so much better

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:14.620 align:middle line:90%
and I can't even believe it.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm not
crazy anymore, you know?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I feel like this is valid.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:19.920 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
More people need
to know about this.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
husband started saying,

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
well, you need to tell people.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, honey, you know,
you sure are doing good.

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%

Could you state your name?

>> My name is Karen Burns.

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was a dental
assistant for 24 years,

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.430 align:middle line:90%
until I couldn't work anymore.

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%


01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
dental assisting,

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:56.040 align:middle line:90%
we didn't wear a mask or gloves.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We had a bottle of
mercury and silver pellets

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.760 align:middle line:90%
that we put together by hand.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We didn't understand that
these vapors were everywhere.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You must see the
damage that it's doing.

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Why should anyone have to
suffer this illness when

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
it can be totally eradicated?

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I hope you people just listen
and find it in your heart

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to really consider all of this.

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:04:34.532 --> 01:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> For the most part, I
generally approached it with

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
a skeptical eye.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I did not do
that necessarily

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
because of any ill will, but
because sometimes if you follow

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
a certain orthodoxy
that's wrong,

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%

theory or anything else,

you're not getting to truth.

our visualization box,

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
which is made out of everyday
materials that you can get

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
in any hardware store.

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Typically in most
dental schools,

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
it's been taught
that the mercury is

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
trapped within the
matrix of the amalgam.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we're trying
to visualize here and prove

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there is a
significant amount that

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
comes off during the
mixing, during the packing.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd have some
teeth with the amalgam

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:25.200 align:middle line:90%
that's been set for a while.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be removing that

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.222 align:middle line:84%
with a high-speed
dental drill in order

01:05:28.222 --> 01:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to visualize how much vapor
comes off during that procedure

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The American Dental
Association has made

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the argument that mercury is
fixed in the amalgam fillings

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't come out easily.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And what this research that
we're doing here visually shows

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:45.670 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you drill
on an amalgam filling,

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that it dramatically exposes
the patient, and the dentist,

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and the dental technician to
huge amounts of mercury vapor

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
that enters the body.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.415 align:middle line:84%
It's even worse than
what they imagined.

01:05:55.415 --> 01:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> 2,483 micrograms
per cubic meter,

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and I've never seen levels
of mercury this high.

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much unheard of
in any type of work environment.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it definitely
shows with just absolute fact,

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
hard science that amalgams when
they are heated with the drill

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
by drilling on them release
copious amounts of mercury,

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
of vapor into the air.

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Clearly, if you're
not measuring it,

01:06:18.867 --> 01:06:21.200 align:middle line:84%
you're not monitoring it, and
you're not educating these

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
employees, then the OSHA
regulations are not being

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
upheld.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I just ask the ADA,
don't you care about your own

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%
people?

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are people
who are members of the FDA.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're exposing them to
high levels of mercury vapor

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
by its still supporting
the use of dental amalgams.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The ADA's message
is just simple.

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's been this
for many, many years.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is that amalgam
is a safe and effective

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
dental material.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's disconcerting that,
despite all the regulations

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
regarding mercury
in the workplace,

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
mainstream dentistry still
promotes these fillings

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.880 align:middle line:90%
as perfectly safe.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> The science hasn't changed.

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:03.703 align:middle line:84%
The science has been
this way for decades.

01:07:03.703 --> 01:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
there's some groups

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
who don't accept
the science, who

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
like to rely on fear
and other factors.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The ADA is a group that just
dismisses and denies without

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.170 align:middle line:90%
doing any experiments.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They could be doing the same
experiments we're doing,

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
showing that mercury
doesn't come off.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I want to see them do that.

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What patient safety
and science shows us,

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
what science shows us now
is that patient safety is

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
absolutely protected with
general amalgam material.

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When a dentist goes in to
grind down the amalgam filling,

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
he is creating tremendous
quantities of mercury

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.932 align:middle line:90%
particulate.

01:07:36.932 --> 01:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So for that period
of time they're working,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
they're 100-fold over the
recommended levels for air

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in a workplace.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.738 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder that
people like Karen

01:07:47.738 --> 01:07:50.155 align:middle line:84%
are going to have an issue
with being in that environment.

01:07:50.155 --> 01:07:53.695 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe that
the vapors that are--

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
the come off from the removal
of an amalgam are going to put

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.360 align:middle line:90%
a patient in harm's way.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Nor do I believe it will
put me in harm's way,

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
although we have
masks, of course,

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.210 align:middle line:90%

us nothing about protecting

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
the dentist, the staff, or

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:12.010 align:middle line:90%
of mercury vapor.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:23.487 align:middle line:90%

because this is not

I mean, the exposure to
mercury to those people

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.112 align:middle line:90%
is just tremendous.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:43.664 align:middle line:90%


01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We are turning now to the
OSHA Hazard Communication

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Standard this is a
final regulation.

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:53.585 align:middle line:84%
And there is no escape
for it, for any of us.

01:08:53.585 --> 01:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone walking around
hazardous chemicals and other

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
toxic substances has a right
to know of possible dangers

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.259 align:middle line:90%
and how to protect themselves.

01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:06.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Health care professionals and
folks all over the country are

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
asking the Food and Drug
Administration to protect

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.729 align:middle line:84%
and inform the public about
the potential dangers of silver

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:15.020 align:middle line:90%
amalgam fillings.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Those include my
colleague Stacy Case.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've been following
Stacy's personal story

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
for months now, telling
you about her diagnosis

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.120 align:middle line:84%
with multiple sclerosis after
a routine dental procedure.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And tonight, Stacy is in San
Francisco sharing her story

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.594 align:middle line:90%
with the federal government.

01:09:31.594 --> 01:09:35.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Nearly four years ago, I let
a dentist talk me into having

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:39.979 align:middle line:84%
four 30-year-old silver mercury
fillings replaced because he

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
said they were cracked.

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Your agency at the
time, though, the FDA,

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
had done nothing to warn me,
an educated professional,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%
that this was a health hazard.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.069 align:middle line:90%
This is a great injustice.

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Seven months after that dental
work, I got out of bed one

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.770 align:middle line:90%
morning and could not walk.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
My children were two
and three at the time.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
My immediate concern was,
will I be caring for them

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
or will it be the
other way around?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I now know that I and
millions of other Americans

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
are genetically predisposed
to autoimmune disease.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And these mercury fillings
are the trigger in many cases.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I read several dozen
scientific studies.

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
One such study, 1990
University of Denmark,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
proved monkeys with
mercury dental fillings

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
stored it in their spinal
ganglia, pituitary gland,

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.380 align:middle line:90%
and many other organs.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:37.760 align:middle line:84%
This stuff seeps into the body
from the day it is implanted.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, you reach
the tipping point,

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.650 align:middle line:90%
like I did, and disease sets in.

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Your hand-picked
scientists in 2006 and 2010

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
have made you keenly
aware of the health risks

01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and the disease causation.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Please do not ignore them
or injured consumers like me

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.640 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.807 align:middle line:84%
You really want to help
this country get health care

01:10:58.807 --> 01:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
costs under control?

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Ban amalgam.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You really want to see a cure
for many autoimmune diseases?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Ban amalgam.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You really want to
ensure American moms

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
like me can play chase with
their children in the yard?

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Ban amalgam.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
After two decades in the news
business, I know the truth.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is silver mercury
fillings are causing disease.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And they are making people
sick, keeping them sick,

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.950 align:middle line:90%
so help me God.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Use your power and position
for good, Dr. Shuren.

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Leave a legacy.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Please right this wrong.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We've gone back and we
looked at the evidence.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell
you is we intend

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to come out with an announcement
by the end of this year.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Since that missed deadline,
the FDA has been silent

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.652 align:middle line:90%
on where the ruling stands.

01:11:43.652 --> 01:11:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, this has
been an emotional journey,

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:47.550 align:middle line:90%
but an important one.

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just hope that my
story affects change.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
In San Francisco, Stacy Case.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Scott, back to you.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.790 align:middle line:90%
[BEEP]

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We've gone back and we
looked at the evidence.

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell
you is we intend

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to come out with an announcement
by the end of this year.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And so 2011 came and went.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometime early in 2012,
I sent an email to my contact

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:12.860 align:middle line:90%
at FDA.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Response I got was,
we'd love to respond,

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
we sent our document
to HHS for approval.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we don't
have a response back yet.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
We sued FDA to compel them
to respond to our petitions

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
after waiting very patiently
for five, six years.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And they did so.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
In January 2015, they came out
with a document that completely

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
affirmed what FDA had found in
2009, which was that mercury

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:43.980 align:middle line:90%
fillings are completely safe.

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We, my team, IAOMT team, we
were all deeply disappointed.

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we get this
whistleblower document.

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a document
provided prohibitions

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
on placing mercury fillings
in tens of millions of people.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.660 align:middle line:90%


01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened here?

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:04.730 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
HHS came back and provided
a political solution

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:10.970 align:middle line:90%
to a thorny scientific problem.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
HHS put the veto on
this statement of policy

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that would have been
published by FDA,

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
but for HHS's
political decision,

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
not scientific, political
decision to not change the way

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
the game was played.

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But don't be deceived,
there are hundreds

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
of peer-reviewed published,
scientific studies

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
by top authors that associate
the mercury in fillings

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.520 align:middle line:90%
with systemic disease.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And so going forward,
what are we going to do?

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back to court
and take this document that

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
was issued way back in 2012 that
states what FDA really thought

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.888 align:middle line:84%
about all this and ask the court
to reinstate the 2012 document.

01:13:51.888 --> 01:13:52.688 align:middle line:90%
That's our plan.

01:13:52.688 --> 01:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%

01:13:59.162 --> 01:14:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Good girl.

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And so coming out here,
just very relaxing.

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Mandy.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%

[WHISTLE]

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever put mercury
vapor in an animal that

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:17.660 align:middle line:90%
didn't make that animal sick.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our government
says, but you

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
can't prove that it's toxic
just because it's there.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.380 align:middle line:90%
The science is there.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

Anyone that has two neurons
left to rub together

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
can look at the
research data and see

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that mercury should not be
placed in the mouth of a child

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.230 align:middle line:90%
or to anyone.

01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you can't get an honest
discussion with our government

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
or with the medical
authorities about this problem.

01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We have not had any success,
taken to them the most solid

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
So, no, I'm upset about it.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.433 align:middle line:90%

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that measuring and
visualizing mercury

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
vapor during routine
dental procedures

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
could be as easy as portrayed
in the movie, but it is.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you're skeptical
of the findings in the movie,

01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
we encourage every
dental professional

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.702 align:middle line:84%
to take the Mercury
Measurement Challenge.

01:17:05.702 --> 01:17:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Our organization has partnered
with Mercury Instruments USA

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
to offer a discounted
rental of their equipment

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
for any dentist who wants to
take the Mercury Measurement

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Challenge.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You will find that the
mercury vapor released

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.120 align:middle line:84%
during the placement and removal
of dental amalgam fillings

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.820 align:middle line:84%
exceeds occupational
safety limits that

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
requires employee protection.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The American Dental
Association recommends

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that dentists periodically
monitor their office

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.520 align:middle line:90%
for dental mercury vapor.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But that suggestion
does not go far enough

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to make dentists truly aware
of the risks of working

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
with mercury.

01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
It is important for
every dental professional

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of occupational
safety requirements

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to protect and inform our
staff from any toxic exposure.

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But it all starts
with being informed.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
visit The International

01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Oral Medicine
and Toxicology website.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:18.285 align:middle line:90%


01:18:18.285 --> 01:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) I watch it
fall down to the ground,

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
cut off the things
that weighed me down.

01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing left I'm
trying to hide, living

01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:27.480 align:middle line:90%
life now feeling free inside.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.390 align:middle line:90%


01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Feeling free inside.

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:35.129 align:middle line:90%


01:18:35.129 --> 01:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I see the beauty of the sun,
another day has just begun.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I start to dream
and start to see,

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
wonder what the
world has for me.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.860 align:middle line:90%


01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
What it has for me.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:55.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm moving on.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving on.

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And it feels wonderful.

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.260 align:middle line:90%


01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wonderful.

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.160 align:middle line:90%


01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving on.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving on.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And it feels wonderful.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:21.060 align:middle line:90%


01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wonderful to me.

01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
