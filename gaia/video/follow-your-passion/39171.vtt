00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I was a short order cook.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:90%
I got fired from that.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I was a baker's helper.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Got fired from that.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Jerry and I, we were
failing at most everything

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:90%
else we were trying.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to
go into business,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing we
liked doing was eating.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.498 align:middle line:84%
I think we've got
possibilities here.

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:90%
I like this combination.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You have a great business
when the goal of the business

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
is to meet the
need, is to create

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:90%
the product, not to make money.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
You make money as a
byproduct of meeting a need,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.475 align:middle line:90%
and doing a great job of it.

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:55.175 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Am I still dripping?

ASSISTANT: There you go.

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:00.285 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm a professional.

00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm an executive.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.906 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
keep your image up.

[SINGING]

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
A handmade hat is much better
than a mass-produced hat,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
maintaining an art.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.035 align:middle line:84%
I think hats are just my way
of speaking to the world.

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Anything'll hold
you up off the floor.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But a really good chair--
it feels good to look at,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%
it feels good to sit in.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And it feels good to
be a part of something

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that you believe in.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
For me, that's worth a lot
more than the pay I get.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.448 align:middle line:90%

WINEMAKER: Every once in while,
you get this time in your life

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that's sealed,
signed, and delivered.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be there forever.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of those times for
me was when I was probably

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:90%
in third or fourth grade.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my mom for
money, and she had no money.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And that broke my heart,
and I never asked her again,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
and I went to work.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got
to where I am today.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I started working,
and I never stopped.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I love growing grapes.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty good at it, and
I'm getting better every year.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of frustration.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.856 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of patience.

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:43.757 align:middle line:84%
And you can't learn how to
grow grapes in 25 or 30 years--

00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it takes a lifetime.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Every year, the whole
thing starts over again.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're powerless to create
spring or summer or fall.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's pretty amazing.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's what
living out in the country,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and living on a ranch
like this does to a guy.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It just puts you in the
middle of God's glory.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the first miracles,
if you believe in God,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
was where Jesus
was at a wedding,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and he turned the
water into wine.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And that, to me, is pretty neat.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Why was that his first choice?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.543 align:middle line:84%
It's because he liked
to drink, just like me.

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:27.958 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I think finding your passion
in life is important,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm lucky enough
to have found that.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I started out just drinking a
lot of beer and chasing women.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
have a plan for it.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:90%
I think it just happens.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think for me, I
believe it's in the vineyard.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what got me
started, and that's

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:90%
where I'd like to end up.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to die in a vineyard,
working the grapes.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
That's my retirement plan.
