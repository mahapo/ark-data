00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.311 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
UFOs. Unidentified flying
objects.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Scientists, researchers, even
military personnel and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.484 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
astronauts have been discussing
them for years.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:54.888 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Some people swear they've seen,
photographed and filmed them.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But all too often, the documents
remain secret.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:02.496 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In recent months however, some
major governments have begun to

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.932 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
make part of their files on the
unidentified flying objects

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:08.368 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
public.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.072 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
France began declassification in
March, 2007,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
followed by Great Britain in
May, 2007,

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:21.348 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and Ecuador in May, 2008.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the same period, the Vatican
gave its opinion on the matter.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Padre Jose Gabriel Funes
released a significant and

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
surprising statement.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A belief in the existence of
extraterrestrials does not go

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.597 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
against the Catholic faith.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Of the secret documents that are
now accessible to the wider

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:48.575 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
public, the Ecuadorian material
is perhaps the most significant

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.777 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and the most fascinating.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And soon the other Latin
American countries may take the

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
same step.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The extraordinary change in the
Ecuadorian government stance on

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
UFOs is due above all to the
work of investigative

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
journalist, Jaime Rodriguez.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.694 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Thanks to his tireless research
and his programs broadcast from

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the Ecuadorian TV channel,
ecuavisa.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His achievement, made together
with the head of state,

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:20.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Raphael Correa, is just the
latest step in a long journey.

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:29.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It took me 22 years, from 1983
to 2005, to try to explain to

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the military that the UFO
phenomenon should go from

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
speculative to official.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That is, if government
authorities get their opinions

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on many issues such as volcanic
eruptions, climate problems and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.202 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
agriculture, why could'nt there
be representatives of the

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
government who discuss this
issue which is so vital to us?

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Things being as they are, when
Colonel Lucio Gutierrez stood

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.884 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
for the presidency of the
republic, we managed to besiege

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
him, so to speak, with the
support of the media.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that's how he offered to
make a commitment, saying to me,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.762 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Mr. Rodriguez, don't worry,
because my government will be

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.565 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
completely different.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.169 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When he became President a
second time, we reminded him of

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.039 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the promise he had made, and he
confirmed his commitment.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He sent us to his personal
secretary Oscar Ayerve

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in Guayaquil, and we brought him
an informational file on the

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
issue, and the reasons why the
Ministry of Defense aught to

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:42.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
give it special attention.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:46.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so on April the 5th, 2005,
the CEIFO, or the

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Ecuadorian Committee for the
Investigation of the UFO

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:53.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Phenomenon was created under the
presidency of Colonel Lucio

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Gutierrez.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.343 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Once the committee was created,
the military began to work with

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
civilians on a convincing report
aimed at persuading the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
government to break the seal of
secrecy on the UFO documents.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:16.923 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But there were major problems
from the start.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.392 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The first problem was the funds
that were promised,

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.995 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
but then not granted.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The civilian researchers thus
decided to

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.066 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
find their own funding.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:32.339 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There were 6 civilians involved,
although officially,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
there were 3 of us.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The other 3 worked with us, and
thus in total

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.046 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
we had a team of 6.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The 6 of us collected the money,
and we spent 12,000 dollars

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in 2 years before we got the
dossier.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The second obstacle was the fact
that military personnel were

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:54.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
afraid of ruining their career
by making official statements,

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
since the UFO phenomenon was not
taken seriously.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The President had to intervene
to resolve the dilemma.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Thus we succeeded in obtaining
authorization from the then-

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:14.214 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Minister of Defense, Lorena
Escudero,

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which stated as follows: 

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.524 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
All military personnel may make
statements with

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:28.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
absolute freedom, and this issue
will not be to the addition of

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:31.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
any detail on their CV that
might damage their reputation.

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:38.672 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In this way, we managed to
overcome the second obstacle,

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which was very important.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The third problem that Rodriguez
and his colleagues had to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.747 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
overcome was also the most
difficult. It directly involved

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:51.117 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the US secret services, who
offered military personnel

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
significant economic and career
related incentives provided that

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:57.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they respected a series of
obligations.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Amongst these, they required
that information and documents

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
regarding UFOs should be
concealed.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the meantime, Raphael Correa,
had been elected

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
President of Ecuador.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In March 2008, a diplomatic
crisis with Columbia led Correa

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to discover that his secret
services had been corrupted.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:30.023 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
He discovered that US
intelligence had secretly

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:34.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
financed the Ecuadorian military
secret services.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:41.167 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So Correa took action. He
dismissed the entire military

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
structure directing the military
secret services, and through the

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:47.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
US embassy, he ordered the
expulsion of all the CIA

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:50.677 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
officers and all those who were
involved in

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
secret work in Ecuador.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This frightened the military
personnel enough that they

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:03.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ceased to conceal information.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:10.897 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The following week, the
President called a meeting in

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:15.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Consejo, the National Security
Council.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The meeting included the Air
Force Commander, the Army

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:24.811 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Commander, the Commander of the
Armed Forces, the Head of the

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:28.581 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Joint Command, and the Minister
of Defense.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:32.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He invited us to this meeting,
and in front of us he said,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Commanders of the Air Force,
Army and Armed Forces

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
must completely deregulate
information on the

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.597 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
UFO phenomenon.

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.167 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We don't want anything about
this issue to remain secret in

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
our country. The documents say
that Jaime Rodriguez

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is authorized to enter any
military structure in the

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.276 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
country to conduct
investigations and gather

00:07:56.276 --> 00:08:01.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
testimony on any case concerning
the UFO phenomenon.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:05.051 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Thanks to this authorization,
over 400 deregulated UFO videos

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are now available to researchers
in Ecuador.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.459 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Most of them were recorded by
civilians.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:15.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In fact, before President
Raphael Correa took a new,

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.697 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
sensational stance on the
subject, the military

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
confiscated all such videos. The
material was regularly

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:25.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
classified, and the public was
denied access to it.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.477 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The statement made by the Chief
of Air Staff,

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:33.747 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Colonel Zanoni Garcia Dominguez
confirms the reason

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
behind this situation.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.421 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Once we have obtained the
analyses and information,

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.024 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we'll be able to transmit all
these documents officially.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:52.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These are the first films of
Unidentified Flying Objects

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:56.603 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to be declassified by the
Ecuadorian government.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:03.309 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
While celebrating a birthday
party at the home of the former

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.379 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Vice President of the Republic,
Luis Parodi,

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
guests noticed an anomalous
object hovering in the sky.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The video was recorded in 1992.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.547 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the images, we can clearly
see the mysterious craft's

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:45.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
orange-colored glow, and its
tubular shape.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This video, also recorded in the
1990's, shows an amazing

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:02.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
glowing platform hovering in the
skies over Quito.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The video was recorded by
Francisco Navarro and his sister

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.724 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
from the terrace of their home.

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.738 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The videos may be the most
fascinating part of the UFO

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:42.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
material, but the direct
testimony made by military

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:45.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
personnel is of even greater
importance.

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:48.214 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
44 statements by military
personnel

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
were released to the CEIFO.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.052 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Today, they are part of the
public domain on

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:58.157 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the internet and YouTube.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These personnel are still in the
military. They have experienced

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the events described in person
whilst in service.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.235 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There can be no doubt as to the
veracity of these statements.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:16.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
While we were executing a flight
maneuver during an instrumental

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:20.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
exercise at the base in Manta,
we saw a light moving towards

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:28.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the Crucita sector near the city
of Crucita.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:32.091 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We notified the control tower
that unknown traffic

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:37.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
was approaching.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:47.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So when we got closer at about
2,000 or 3,000 feet,

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:50.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we veered left to get a better
look at the lights

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:54.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
we had in front of us.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.717 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Right then the 2 lights moved
into formation with

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:01.754 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
incredible speed and flew off
toward the Crucita Mountains

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:04.157 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
near the city of Crucita.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:11.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We flew over the sector but we
were unable to locate them.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:17.036 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We had begun our descent from
11,000 feet,

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I reckon that we had
descended by about 2,000 feet

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when I saw a very bright light
more or less around,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:28.081 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
how can I put it, at a position
of about 5 o clock- a bit lower.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I was in the back cockpit of the
airplane, and

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:35.888 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Major Enriquez was in the front
cockpit.

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:40.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I pointed it out to him and he
saw it.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Immediately afterward I called
the control tower to verify

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.898 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
whether there was an airplane,
to which the tower responded

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:49.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that there was no traffic.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:52.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We thought it was an airplane,
but in the moment we veered

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.973 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
toward this bright light,

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:57.076 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we saw that the object turned
toward us and divided into

00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:02.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
two very intense lights on a
collision course with us.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:05.051 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So the pilot in the front
cockpit, the Major,

00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
executed a maneuver to the left,
and while we were turning,

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:11.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we continued to watch what the
object was doing,

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and we saw that it stopped in
mid-air

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:17.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and moved down toward the
mountains.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.899 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We tried to fly over a small
mountain and the object crossed

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
us on this side and while we
tried to cross it from

00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:26.205 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the other side it disappeared
without a trace.

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:29.208 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We scanned the area but there
was no trace of it.

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We thought it was an airplane,
but the movements this light

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
made were very fast, very
erratic.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
An airplane can't do that, for
example,

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
turn and stop in mid-air and
descend- descend diagonally.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
No airplane can do that.

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The instruments we have enable
us to identify

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:50.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the objects moving in airspace
clearly.

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:54.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We can clearly distinguish a
commercial airplane

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:58.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
from a military airplane, or
from extraneous objects.

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:00.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have a lot of confidence in
the capability

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.408 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of these instruments.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.644 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Therefore, the information we
have available,

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
not just our information, but
also that coming from abroad,

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in particular from the United
States,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which is a very qualified source
of information,

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.355 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
makes me confident that we're
dealing with an area in which

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:20.493 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there are Unidentified Flying
Objects.

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:24.564 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In real terms, these are
extraterrestrial objects,

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:26.165 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and I'm sure of it.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We share the universe with other
beings.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Statements of such significance
have never before been made

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
publicly by military officials
in active service.

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And they show the level of
importance of the order that

00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.419 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
President Correa had given to

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Commanders of the Armed
Forces on June the 25th, 2007,

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:55.962 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with official document number
2007-0439 CSN.

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:04.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These events combined with Jaime
Rodriguez's role as a

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
television journalist began to
change civilian society's

00:15:07.707 --> 00:15:12.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
attitude towards the UFO
phenomenon in Ecuador.

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:19.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We've noticed that there's a
greater sense of maturity

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:22.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
among us now. The population has
a more mature attitude

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:26.859 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
towards the UFO phenomenon.

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This stimulates us to move our
work into the analytical part

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:33.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the subject, which is what we
really need to focus on now.

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:36.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Initially, civilians seemed to
be afraid to call me and say,

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:38.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I've recorded a video.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:41.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Now they do, and with new vigor.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.277 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
People are participating much
more now.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I get a lot of emails stating,
I've taken this photo,

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.881 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I've recorded this video.

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That is, we've noted an increase
in cooperation on the part of

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:56.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the civilian community regarding
testimony and evidence.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.157 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is the sense of maturity
I'm talking about.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So the sensationalist press,
which has often used this

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
subject to sell magazines or
other things, has

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
suddenly gone quiet. Completely.

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:15.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This change began to yield its
first fruits.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:20.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The example that Rodriguez
describes is emblematic.

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'd had a lot of problems with
the airport's radar director.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.751 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He was always annoyed with me
because

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
he didn't believe in UFOs.

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:30.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So this gentleman saw that I was
leaving and he called me,

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Hey, Jaime Rodriguez, come here.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:36.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And he said to me, seeing as
you're interested in

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.998 align:middle line:74% position:47% size:53%
these things, have 
a look at this photo.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was taken here, yesterday,
at about 6 pm.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And he gave me this photo.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.005 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
This is evidence.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:49.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was taken by the radar
director at Guayaquil airport.

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:52.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Even some young people from a
famous Ecuadorian

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:55.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
music group called los Chaucha
Kings contacted me.

00:16:55.548 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Their drummer, Diego Mino, had
taken a photo of it.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.122 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The same object photographed by
two or three people at the same

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:06.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
hour on the same day is even
stronger evidence for us.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's a substantial change in
behavior for those who had

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:15.301 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
denied and opposed the matter
before.

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Just think, now they're
contributing.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.405 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
They're providing evidence.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This is a real change in
attitude caused by this,

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:26.746 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how can I put it, this openness
in deregulating the information

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:29.882 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
on UFOs in Ecuador.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.885 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The photo shows a clearly
disk-shaped object

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.055 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
above the Guuayaquil city
airport buildings.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We can easily make out the UFO's
hexagonal structure.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.571 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
For a number of years
Unidentified Flying Objects

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:56.008 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
have often been detected near
erupting volcanos,

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:59.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or those that are about to
become active.

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:05.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have a volcanic chain, part
of which is active,

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.955 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the other part returning to
activity.

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:11.991 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Tungurahua attracts media
interest with TV stations

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:14.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
placing their cameras there to
film the volcano

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
each time it erupts.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.965 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And they show these objects
twirling in the sky.

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:21.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
TV stations get involved in this
phenomenon filming the UFOs

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:25.571 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
flying around the volcanos.

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.307 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
During an eruption of the
volcano Tungurahua

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:31.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the main national channel in
Ecuador, Teleamazonas,

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:36.215 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
films the extraordinary
spectacle.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Suddenly a glowing object
appears above the volcanic

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:43.356 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
crater, and then disappears
after just a few seconds.

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:49.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
At one point, a mysterious
glowing craft reappears.

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:54.567 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Cameraman Marco Ramirez and
Julio Avilar captured

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:57.336 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the incredible scene on film.

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:02.008 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The object is moving, the video
cameras are set on tripods.

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:10.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Shortly afterwards, flashes of
light

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
similar to lightning begin to
appear.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.123 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
When slowing down the images, we
can clearly distinguish

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:20.359 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
these flashes of light.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They seem to come out of the
light spheres.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.366 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Then, a series of even larger
and brighter flashes appears

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:30.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
at the mouth of the volcano.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.641 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In this still, one of the
flashes seems to come

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.844 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
from two side by side sources
while other smaller flashes

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
appear above them.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:45.851 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Here we can see three light
spheres,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:50.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and only one of them emits a
flash.

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.692 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Later, telemetric analyses
conducted in the United States

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:56.395 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
have revealed that the object
inside the crater

00:19:56.395 --> 00:20:00.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
had to have been at least 30
meters in diameter.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:03.836 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But what sort of technology
enables a flying object to stop

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:07.039 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
at the mouth of an erupting
volcano?

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:15.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The incredible objects we're
seeing in this video was

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:19.251 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
filmed by an Ecuadorian
government official.

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.861 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Once again, the video was
recorded

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:32.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
near Ecuador's volcanic chain.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:38.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the end, the witness and his
friends reach the panoramic spot

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:41.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in front of the volcano
Tungurahua,

00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
their original destination
before the sighting.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.016 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It wasn't the first time that
this type of UFO

00:23:04.016 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
had been sighted and filmed.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the 1990's Victor Chiluiza
sighted and filmed

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
this flying object in Ecuador.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It looks very similar to the one
we've just seen.

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When I realized that they
actually didn't seem to be

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
airplanes or balloons, I felt a
thrill, and I understood

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that it really wasn't what I had
expected. It was a UFO.

00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:42.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It must have been 200-180 meters
from here.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:46.058 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It was closer, and so it looked
larger. And, I don't know,

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:49.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
maybe the video camera helped me
to put it into focus enough

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:52.131 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to see the image clearly, and I
believe it was thanks

00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:55.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
to the video camera.

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:57.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And one thing that really caught
my attention was that

00:23:57.303 --> 00:23:59.038 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
it made no noise.

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I might have thought it was an
airplane, a helicopter,

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
but I couldn't hear any noise.

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:08.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that was what made me get my
video camera and start filming.

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.649 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But when I saw it through the
video camera,

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
when I saw it from close-up, I
didn't see the typical saucer

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
shape, but rather the shape of a
sort of star, a very particular

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:23.595 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
shape that I had never seen
before.

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I got the impression that it was
something out of the ordinary,

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:31.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
something that I would never
have imagined seeing.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It really struck me, the fact
that I saw something

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:37.843 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that's so rarely sighted.

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:41.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It seems natural to me, I mean
in such an immense universe,

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:46.118 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the third planet can't possibly
be the only inhabited one.

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've always believed it, and I
have to be honest,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.091 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I always wanted to see a flying
object.

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:55.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when at last I was able to
see one,

00:24:55.127 --> 00:24:57.663 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
it was a dream come true.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:06.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Another similar craft was
subsequently filmed in Mexico.

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:09.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The first was sighted and filmed
in Ticul Yucatan

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:13.312 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
on the 7th of August, 2004.

00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:11.904 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Another similar flying object
was filmed in Ticul, Mexico

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:15.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on the 12th of December, 2004.

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.889 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Another sighting confirms the
link between

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:35.561 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Unidentified Flying Objects and
volcanic areas.

00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:39.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This time it was filmed by a
truly exceptional witness.

00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:44.736 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The event took place near
Ecuador's capital, Quito.

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:49.041 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Here the wind can reach up to
140 km per hour.

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:51.743 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A family is on an outing in the
countryside

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:54.079 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
when something attracts their
attention.

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.114 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
An unusual object hovering in
the air,

00:26:56.114 --> 00:27:00.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
despite the strong wind.

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:03.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Filming the event is Ecuador's
Chief of Police.

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:47.699 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That same night, the staff of
Quito's Ecuavisa television

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
channel received several calls
notifying them of the presence

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:56.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of a mysterious brightly shining
craft right above the crater.

00:27:56.341 --> 00:28:00.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The station sent a team straight
away to film what was happening.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:04.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The following is their report,
which was later broadcast.

00:28:08.954 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now, we'll go back to the news
we gave you at the beginning of

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.894 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the program due to the large
number of calls we've received.

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:18.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The peace was disturbed at Quito
tonight by a phenomenon

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:22.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that has not yet been explained.

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:25.804 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Here we see the images recorded
earlier, a bright blinking

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
yellow and red colored light
appeared and disappeared

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:31.577 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in the skies south of the
capital.

00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:34.846 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The phenomenon was seen from
various neighborhoods in Quito,

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:38.417 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and residents primarily in the
southern area

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:40.052 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
have been calling our staff
continually

00:28:40.052 --> 00:28:42.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to tell us that they saw it.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:44.656 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Ecuavisa's video cameras
recorded the

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.525 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
images you're seeing now.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:53.198 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
By analyzing the images, we can
clearly see that the light

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:56.702 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
emanating from the UFO even
shines through the clouds.

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:12.351 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The mysterious object's varying
luminosity and its

00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:15.454 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
ability to hover proved that it
couldn't be a headlight

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:19.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
on an airplane, or any other
conventional craft.

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:33.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Quito was once more the setting
for another incredible sighting.

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:35.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's another important
declassified case

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:41.079 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which joins the already
extensive CEIFO archives.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On September the 5th, 2007, Dr.
Antonio Ozzorio witnessed

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a very special phenomenon.

00:29:48.754 --> 00:29:55.494 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
A flotilla.

00:29:55.494 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I was sitting down having lunch
and chatting with Patricia

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:00.866 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about the patients, as we always
do.

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:04.002 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Patricia came back in, looked
out of the window and said,

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:07.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Doctor, look. What could that
be?

00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I went to the window and I also
saw some...

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
they looked like airplanes or
balloons.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They seemed to me to be more
like aerostats, but I was amazed

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.286 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to see so many of them.

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:30.395 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I ran out, called my wife and
told her to come and see.

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:33.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was a really strange thing,
and I asked her

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:35.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
where my video camera was.

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:38.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I ran to get it, and we went out
onto the terrace

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:39.638 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to watch the scene.

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:42.908 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We can see a classic flotilla
composed of about

00:30:42.908 --> 00:30:45.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
57 white spheres in the sky.

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:49.081 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The video camera has recorded a
sound similar to the

00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:54.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
rattling of a train in their
presence.

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:56.354 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
CEIFO researchers checked
whether the

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:59.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
military aviation command or the
civil aviation office

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:01.359 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
had authorized the release of
aerostats

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.161 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
or other similar objects.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:09.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But their answer was negative.

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:12.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I thought that there were no
fewer than 50 of them.

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:16.108 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
At first sight they were moving
forward in a uniform way.

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:18.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But once I filmed them, it
appeared that

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:21.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they were brightly shining
objects and

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:24.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
apparently they moved very
quickly.

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I saw two objects fly by, flat
and oval shaped.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.056 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Curiosity drove me to go to the
window and I said,

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:33.892 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Doctor, come look at this. What
is it?

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we stood in front of the
window,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.362 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and when we saw what it was

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:41.566 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we noted that there were about
50 of them, so many of them.

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:47.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Dr. Antonio Ozzorio had always
been skeptical

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.141 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
about the UFO phenomenon.

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:50.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He would never have imagined
that

00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
one day he'd be involved in such
an event.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.317 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
No, I didn't believe them
because they've always said

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:02.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there are people who know how to
edit video in such a way

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:07.826 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
as to make us believe they're
real, but they aren't.

00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:10.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But now I believe it. I have
faith in it.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Nowadays, we're accustomed to
seeing security cameras

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.841 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
positioned at various points in
our cities.

00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're part of the scenery, and
nobody notices them anymore.

00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:30.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In Ecuador they call them 'eagle
eyes'.

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.683 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
We know the 
cameras are there

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:34.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to watch out for accidents
or criminal acts.

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:40.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But in Cuenca, Ecuador, they
recorded a rather unusual scene.

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:47.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In Cuenca, a city in the
mountains South Ecuador,

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:52.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there are surveillance cameras
in the streets.

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:54.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
One of these filmed some
children pointing to the sky

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:56.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
from the terrace of their house.

00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:01.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The person operating the
surveillance camera

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.915 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
zoomed in on the children and
moved it upwards

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.851 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to see what they were pointing
to in space.

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
By doing so he had located and
filmed a UFO

00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:15.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
moving toward the Cajas Lagoons.

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The model of video camera with
which these extraordinary

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
images were recorded is very
sophisticated and expensive.

00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:29.007 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
While the UFO was being filmed,
a second object appeared

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:32.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
at the same point, and they both
went toward Cajas.

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:34.446 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Here, the same thing that
happened in other cases

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:36.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
repeated itself.

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The UFO stopped- hovering.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.886 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
When the children pointed to it
and someone there

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:43.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
began to film it, the object
started to move.

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:46.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think that there was some form
of intelligence inside it.

00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:56.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
By analyzing the images we can
note how the first object

00:33:56.635 --> 00:34:00.005 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
begins to move the moment the
video camera pans over it.

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:08.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This becomes even clearer when
the second

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:11.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Unidentified Flying Object
arrives to accompany the first

00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:13.418 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
before they fly away.

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:24.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This video is part of the UFO
material that was declassified

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:28.066 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
thanks to President Raphael
Correa's order.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.902 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Therefore the authenticity of
these videos has been confirmed

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:34.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
by the Presidency of the
Republic of Ecuador.

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:40.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The great results that Rodriguez
has achieved in Ecuador thus far

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:46.084 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are unequalled in any other
South American country.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But even in other nations like
Brazil,

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:51.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the ufological community is very
active.

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But it sets itself similar
goals.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:57.329 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ademar Jose Gevaerd is the best
known Brazilian investigator

00:34:57.329 --> 00:34:59.698 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
following the UFO phenomenon.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:11.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The best known cases in Brazil
even on an international level

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:16.548 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
are fairly specific, distinct
cases.

00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:19.684 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For example, UFOs in the Amazon
area are a matter of frequent

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:22.187 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
discussion, and Brazilian
ufologists

00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:25.523 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
have been examining the cases
for some time.

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:29.594 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In fact, a constant alien
presence in the wild and nearly

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:33.031 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
unexplored Amazon area is
something of a legend.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
An ancient memory of contact
with beings from the stars

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.839 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
has been passed down in the
myths and traditions of

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
many cultures that some consider
primitive.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.713 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The Kayapo Tribe is among these
witnesses.

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:55.186 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We have indigenous nations, and
this is an incredible thing,

00:35:57.455 --> 00:36:00.392 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
entire indigenous populations
who base their rituals and

00:36:00.392 --> 00:36:03.294 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
folk celebrations on the
supposition that they are

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:08.867 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
of extra-planetary origins.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:13.071 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
For example, the indigenous
people of Upper Xingu believe

00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that they descend from a
mythical being called

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Bep Kororoti

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:21.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who came to Earth decades,
centuries ago,

00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:24.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
according to the cultural
traditions of that people,

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.818 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
leaving an extraterrestrial
legacy.

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:33.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They believe that they belong to
a civilization

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:36.161 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
from beyond Earth, and that one
day they will be brought back

00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:39.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to their homeland.

00:36:39.164 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In remembrance of their ancient
descent from the stars,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Kayapo celebrate a rite in
which one of them personifies

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the mythical Bep Kororoti, the
being from space who taught them

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:53.845 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
how to farm, and many other
things.

00:36:56.448 --> 00:36:59.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The costume used in the ceremony
is made of woven vegetable

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:07.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
fibers, and its shape suggests
more modern clothing.

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.527 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The headdress clearly simulates
a helmet,

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:14.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the rest resembles a
pressurized suit.

00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:19.237 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Is this just an ancient myth, or
could it be something else?

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
However you choose to view it,

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's an intriguing story for our
times.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One of the most important
ufological cases that took place

00:37:31.483 --> 00:37:36.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in the Amazon area directly
involved the Brazilian military.

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:40.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The operation known as Prato
took place in 1977

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:43.828 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the state of Para within the
Amazon area,

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:46.598 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and it achieved extraordinary
results.

00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:54.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The military became involved
after a remarkable number of

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.008 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
sightings and contacts began to
alarm the population

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:59.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and the local authorities.

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:07.018 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We reached such a serious level
that the local authorities

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:10.688 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
informed the Para state
government,

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:14.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which in turn requested that the
Brazilian air force intervene.

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:19.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So an investigation was ordered.
As a consequence, operation

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:28.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Prato was launched in September,
and ended in December, 1977.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.876 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It produced about 2,000 pages of
documents of which we have

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
over 200 filed in folders.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It also produced 500 photographs
of flying saucers, including

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
some taken from close range.

00:38:42.554 --> 00:38:45.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We have about two dozen of
those.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Operation Prato also produced at
least 16 hours of footage

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:55.533 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
showing flying saucers over the
Amazon area rivers.

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:58.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Brazilian ufologists, and in
particular UFO Magazine,

00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:03.208 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
have none of this material.

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:06.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Operation Prato, which means
'saucer', as in 'flying saucer',

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:09.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
was closed down by the Brazilian
military command

00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:11.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in December, 1977.

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:17.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The reason for this was puzzling
to say the least.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It was closed because something
happened,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the very thing that the military
was looking for.

00:39:24.996 --> 00:39:27.565 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Contact with extraterrestrial
beings.

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.901 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That was one of their
objectives: 

00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:32.237 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to attempt to establish contact
with

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:34.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the forms of intelligence behind
the phenomenon.

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They didn't think it could
happen.

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:40.812 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
When it happened, to put it
simply, when there was

00:39:40.812 --> 00:39:42.914 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
direct contact between an
official of the

00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:45.717 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Brazilian Air Force and the
extraterrestrial beings,

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:51.155 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
which happened around
mid-December, 1977,

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Brazilian Air Force simply
understood

00:39:53.091 --> 00:39:55.093 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that it might lose control of
the situation,

00:39:55.093 --> 00:39:59.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and as a consequence it closed
down operation Prato for good.

00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:06.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Gevaerd first received
confirmation of these

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
extraordinary events from
Colonel Uyrange Hollanda,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
the mission's commander.

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.114 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Colonel Hollanda mysteriously
took his own life

00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:19.083 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
sometime later.

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.953 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The incredible results achieved
by this military operation

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:24.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
pushed the ufologists to attempt
to persuade the government

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:27.959 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to release the documentation it
had produced.

00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:35.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Today, our mission in Brazil
aims to get that material

00:40:35.133 --> 00:40:37.802 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
finally declassified.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We've already had confirmation
from various military sources.

00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:42.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At the moment, it mainly comes
from

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Brigadier Jose Carlos Pereira,
former commander

00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the Brazilian Aerospace
Defense Command.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Commander Pereira not only
confirmed the truth

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:54.252 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
behind this operation and the
classified documents,

00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:56.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but also gave an assessment of
it from a strategic

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:57.755 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and a military perspective.

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:06.230 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The reports are kept in the
archive

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.732 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and classified as secret.

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:13.104 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now if I were to say during
operation Prato there was

00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:17.275 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
this or that contact,

00:41:17.275 --> 00:41:21.245 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I'd be violating the secrecy
imposed by law on my country.

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:23.548 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can't do it. I can't reveal
it.

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:27.685 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Otherwise I'd be committing a
crime.

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:33.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I can say, please change the
law. Please make a new law.

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The UFO matter does not
constitute a threat of war

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:40.765 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to any country.

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:42.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It doesn't threaten anyone's
safety,

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:45.203 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and doesn't cause panic amongst
the population.

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:50.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It doesn't even threaten
people's privacy.

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:55.947 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I see no reason why it can't be
completely opened and divulged.

00:41:55.947 --> 00:41:58.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Pereira's analysis even made
news

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:03.988 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on the international ufological
scene.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:06.724 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There is an extensive amount of
evidence and witness accounts,

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:12.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
not just in Brazil but
throughout the world.

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:15.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This evidence is quite valid and
carries great weight.

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:19.604 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Commander Pereira's words are
supported

00:42:19.604 --> 00:42:21.606 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
by the never ending stream of
cases

00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:24.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which continues to appear with
increasing frequency.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:31.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In the rest of South America

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.385 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the videos and photographs that
have been produced

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are certainly not as numerous as
in Mexico,

00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:38.423 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
but the material in existence

00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:40.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
provides researchers and
scientists

00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.727 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with increasingly extraordinary
material

00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:44.295 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
for their investigations.

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:48.966 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Peru has been the stage for
remarkable UFO appearances

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
since the 1990s.

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:53.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A very intense wave of sightings
took place

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:56.140 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
in the capital of Lima in 1999.

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:01.379 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The videos recorded at the time

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:05.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
caught the attention of both the
media and the Peruvian public.

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:18.496 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A number of very bright
unidentified objects

00:43:18.496 --> 00:43:20.231 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
flying at low altitudes

00:43:20.231 --> 00:43:25.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
generated unease in Lima's
population.

00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:27.872 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
People didn't know how to
explain what was happening,

00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:30.942 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the authorities were unable
to provide any clarification

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:34.011 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
regarding the nature of the
unknown craft.

00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:38.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
On the 20th of May 2007,

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:41.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a flotilla appeared in the skies
over Lima,

00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
rekindling interest in the media
and the Peruvian public.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.919 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This is the news report
broadcast

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:50.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
on the channel ATV Noticias.

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:53.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It was about noon when people on
the street saw this

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:55.459 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
spectacular phenomenon.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:36.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The event was also filmed from
another point in the city.

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:43.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
By analyzing the frames we can
clearly see

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:48.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the classic white spheres making
up the flotilla.

00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:52.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It doesn't happen often that
people in traffic stop

00:45:52.683 --> 00:46:00.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to witness a spectacular show of
Unidentified Flying Objects.

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.693 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The city of Treinta y Tres in
Uruguay

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:05.997 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
was at the center of one of
these rare cases.

00:46:05.997 --> 00:46:08.232 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The episode took place when
Georgio Bongiovanni

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:11.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
was visiting from Italy.

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He'd travelled there for a
series of conferences

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:16.474 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
regarding the presence of UFOs.

00:46:43.768 --> 00:46:47.204 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
In the video we can clearly see
numerous flying objects

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:50.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
hovering in the clear sky.

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:52.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They're flying at a relatively
low altitude,

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and are easily seen by the
people on the street.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.382 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The objects' movement clearly
shows their ability

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:02.219 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to move autonomously during
flight.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.221 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Yet another spectacular example

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:07.491 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of this unknown form of
aviation.

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:14.665 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Tarbaca is near San Jose, the
capital of Costa Rica.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Just before 4 o clock in the
afternoon,

00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:19.537 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Marvin Badilla, a young
carpenter, was working

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:21.205 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
when he heard a strange buzzing

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:24.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that distracted him from his
work.

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:27.211 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
To his intense amazement, the
young man saw

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:31.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that the source of the noise was
about 100 meters away from him.

00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:38.823 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was shaping this table here
outside. It was very cloudy.

00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:41.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I looked up and I saw some
sort of object.

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.761 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It was very bright. I looked at
it carefully

00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:46.430 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and took out my mobile phone.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I saw that it was giving me time
to film it,

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:52.937 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
so I started to record.

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I called my colleague who was
working with the drill,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
but he didn't hear me.

00:47:58.142 --> 00:48:00.044 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
I called him again.

00:48:00.044 --> 00:48:02.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I turned towards him, moving the
phone,

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:06.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and when I turned back

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:10.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the object had already gone.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:13.958 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The film that Marvin recorded
shows a classic flying saucer

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:18.062 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
hovering just a few meters from
the ground.

00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His colleague, William Rivera,
didn't hear Marvin shouting

00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:25.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
over the noise of the drill he
was using.

00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:29.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Thus he missed the extraordinary
spectacle.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[yelling and drill noises]
William! William!

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:49.160 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
William Rivera assures us that
Marvin was quite shaken.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
No, he wouldn't calm down.

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:55.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He was still very, very worked
up.

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You see, I believe that this was
a UFO.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.709 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I have no doubt it wasn't
manmade.

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:11.949 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And why was it here? We don't
know.

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.685 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The movements that the craft
makes and its appearance prove

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:18.689 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that it could not have been a
conventional earthly vehicle.

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.558 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
According to Marvin's
description,

00:49:20.558 --> 00:49:26.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the object was about as large as
the wheel of a large tractor.

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:28.632 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It wouldn't have been large
enough to hold

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
a normal sized person.

00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:33.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Oscar Sierra, the ufologist from
Costa Rica,

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
explains his theory to the
Teletica journalists.

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's not necessarily a driven
object,

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.549 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
it could be some sort of probe,

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:48.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
like those that human beings
sent to Titan not that long ago,

00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:54.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which were small, about 2
meters.

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:56.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Therefore they aren't
necessarily piloted objects,

00:49:56.927 --> 00:50:01.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
rather they could be some kind
of surveying probe.

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:05.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's hard to say whether this is
the correct explanation.

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:08.839 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But it's clear that the video
recorded by Marvin Badilla

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:12.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is among the best documents that
the investigators have today.

00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:24.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Continual sightings in South
America

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:26.023 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and in the rest of the world.

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:28.425 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The creation of an official UFO
investigation committee

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.527 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
in Ecuador.

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:33.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The declassification of secret
files in other nations

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:36.300 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
such as France and England.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The statements made by the
Vatican.

00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:40.404 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A new perception of the
phenomenon

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:43.908 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in ever wider areas of civilian
society.

00:50:43.908 --> 00:50:48.379 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They're all signs that something
is changing.

00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:50.214 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Various ancient prophecies
predict that

00:50:50.214 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
change is coming to humanity.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:57.254 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
For Jaime Rodgriguez, this hope
is a certainty.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.726 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Absolutely. We're at the
beginning of a new era.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:08.332 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In fact, we've got a lot of
responsibility.

00:51:08.332 --> 00:51:09.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I'm a person who truly
believes,

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.502 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that is I have a feeling that

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:14.538 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the predictions that the Maya
made for 2012

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:17.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
are of great importance.

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:20.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I believe that people's
conscience is going to change.

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.848 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Might this be true? Certainly

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:27.685 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we can hope that humanity might
soon be able to

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:30.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
unlock the mystery

00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:34.358 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of what seems to be an
increasingly frequent presence.
