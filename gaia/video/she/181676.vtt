00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I had this reoccurring dream
since I was four years old.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
There was this boogie man,
and everyone in my family

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.657 align:middle line:84%
had to run outside and hide
from this boogie man who

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
was going to get us.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we were outside
hiding in the garden,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and he was just right
around the hedge.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I knew he was there.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And he communicated to
me, and the communication

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
was what needs to be killed
for the rest of you to live.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I was a very intuitive child,
deeply connected to what

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I might call an inner knowing.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I could sense the things that
people didn't want to say,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
the things that were
unspoken in the room.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say these things,
and it was very uncomfortable

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that I couldn't
be held and made safe

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
having this kind of seeing and
having this kind of knowing.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I had to make a choice
that the rest of me

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
needed to survive to
adulthood, and this

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
was the thing that was going
to have to be sacrificed.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:02:01.153 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:10%
>> CHRISTINE PAGE: And I think
it's important to recognize

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:10%
that we are living in a world
of duality and that there is

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:10%
a masculine and feminine just
as is a day and night and a left

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:10%
and right.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't make one
better than another.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>> ALEX WARDEN: What I would say
is that feminine consciousness

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
is more relational,
is non-hierarchical.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:10%
It's embracing.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.695 align:middle line:10%
It focus on the things
that-- things and events

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:29.495 align:middle line:10%
have in common.

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The masculine approach is
much more classification.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.851 align:middle line:10%
It's much more focused
on the differences.

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY WENNSTROM: I think
men need to define reality--

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:10%
no, it needs to be a thing.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like masculine
and feminine bodies.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Masculine body's a thing.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Women's body is a space.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>>ANAT VAUGHAN-LEE:
A devotion quality

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:10%
is you can say this
was a feminine quality

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:10%
because a devotional,
somebody who gave themselves.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:10%
It means that they don't
put themself first.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:90%
So you can't hide it.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.305 align:middle line:90%
You're in touch with something.

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:90%
You're in touch with your heart.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:90%
You feel.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:90%
You feel the other, empathy.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.642 align:middle line:90%
It's a feminine quality.

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I'm just your
average American girl born

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in the middle class,
went to public schools.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
What was valued in my family
was intellectual intelligence,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
linear thought, verbal
communication skills.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
If you lost an argument,
you were not valued.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You were the loser
of the argument.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I was also a
competitive athlete.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:10%
So I had all these competitive
I win, you lose perspectives.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So all of these ways of being
negated another part of myself.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see it
reflected in the world.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see people going,
oh, I love how intuitive

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you are or creative you are or I
love how you connect to people.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.178 align:middle line:84%
It just wasn't seen
as something of value.

00:04:24.178 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got to
the corporate world,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
these feminine skills
that I had were being used

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.075 align:middle line:90%
to make somebody else money.

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody's embracing the
internet but not with the kind

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of fervor, not with
the kind of experience,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and not with the kind of
resources that IBM brings

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.625 align:middle line:90%
to the table.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I didn't value the feminine.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know it.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
the part to myself

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.118 align:middle line:84%
that made it possible for me to
actually function in the world

00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:90%
because they were hidden.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LLEWELLYN
VAUGHAN-LEE: As far as I

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:10%
can see the feminine has to
do with the whole mystery

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:10%
of creation, the feminine
is the mother out

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:10%
of which everything is born.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:10%
So the feminine is the
matrix of creation.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:10%
It is this divine
substance that gives birth

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.736 align:middle line:10%
to everything in existence.

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:10%
>>VANDANA SHIVA: The
feminine is in everyone.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:10%
The feminine is not about sex.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.886 align:middle line:90%
It's about a principle.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTINE PAGE: It's so much
easier to discuss the masculine

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
side, which I think many
of us carry, women and men.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:10%
And it has been heightened
over the last 3,000

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:10%
years, the patriarchal
society, the masculine society,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:10%
and the masculine
elements of doing,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:10%
going out, being more
assertive, more aggressive,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:10%
being more competitive.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.535 align:middle line:84%
Feminine qualities, however,
are the ability to receive.

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:25.242 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>>HILARY HART: They're
qualities of the feminine that

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:10%
are very interrelated
with women's bodies.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, when
women are having a baby,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:10%
the line between woman
and baby is very fluid.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So women have this
natural capacity

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to merge that affects the
rest of their lives, to merge,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to relate, to receive
information from,

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:90%
and to offer what's needed.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:10%
And that comes from
the body that we have,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:10%
which is able to
gestate a child.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLAND BISHOP:
Everything that receives

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
is a quality of the feminine.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:10%
For instance, hospitality is
a feminine art in our society,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:10%
not to degree that that
it's exclusively for women

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:10%
but the art of
hospitality is to be

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:10%
able to prepare a
space for the guests.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:22.702 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.702 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to be talking a
little bit about trying to find

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
your life's goal.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Are there some things that
people can do initially

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
to slow down and start
listening to their inner self?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.453 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.453 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I was successful in the
corporate world until my life

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:90%
fell apart.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:10%
But that's what happened was
that something wasn't being

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.425 align:middle line:10%
fed, and my life fell apart.

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:90%
I was at a startup.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%
I was working 10 hours a day.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have a day
offer several months.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It was just an adrenaline,
hard-pushing, hard-focused

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
environment where if you
take a lunch, you're a wimp.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.003 align:middle line:90%
You take a lunch, you're a wimp.

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I just pushed and
pushed and pushed.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain
point in my life,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.209 align:middle line:90%
well, the universe said stop.

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.795 align:middle line:90%
My partner committed suicide.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And then two members
of my family died.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.455 align:middle line:90%
And that was within three weeks.

00:08:50.455 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I crashed physically,
and I had what

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I would call a reckoning,
something where

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I had to look hard at
the way I was living

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and what my real values were.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no way to continue
down the path I was on.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:90%
It was just done.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:90%
That's done.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:84%
That is the end of
that part of your life.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was terrified
because I'd only known

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:90%
hard work and focus and drive.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:55.252 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY WENNSTROM: I think
of the feminine and masculine

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
like stars and the
black holes in space.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And in a way the black
hole being very feminine,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
it's like it can create a
star or it can consume a star.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It looks like nothing, but it's
a very powerful, hovering force

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
in nature whereas the masculine,
you might say, is a star.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It's what you see.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:90%
It's the external thing.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It gets the light
and the glitter,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have that inner
power that the feminine has.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:37.478 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HILARY HART: The feminine is
the aspect of every human being

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:90%
that wants to receive love.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:10%
So the feminine of longing.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The feminine says
I'm longing for love.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:10%
I want to know more of you, god.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's real.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And that longing
pushes a human soul--

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
male or female-- pushes a
human soul closer and closer

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:90%
to what's real.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.327 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STACEY LAWSON: I think
every man and every woman

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
has access to that
sacred feminine power.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not gender based.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:10%
If you move beyond even the
littlest bit beyond this sense

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:10%
of separate self where men and
women are different and simply

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:10%
look at the interior
landscape of any individual,

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.035 align:middle line:10%
there is both masculine
and feminine at play.

00:11:33.035 --> 00:11:39.504 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MAATA LYNN BARRON:
For myself, I

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
would say that my male
was far more developed.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:10%
And then at some point,
the female element

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:10%
started to move
more inside of me.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.206 align:middle line:10%
>> So how would you describe
feminine consciousness?

00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:24.998 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STACEY LAWSON: I
spent a lot of time

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in masculine settings
and masculine roles

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:90%
early in my life.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
very small logging

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and mill town that
was very blue collar

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and certainly
masculine dominated.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
My education was in the
traditional corporate business

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.627 align:middle line:84%
I went to Harvard
Business School,

00:12:46.627 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
which has a whole bunch
of models and ways

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about the world that
tend to be highly masculinized.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And from there I started my
first company when I was 25,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.665 align:middle line:84%
sold that, and worked
in public companies

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate boardroom
and the executive office

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that all seemed to be
driven by the sense of power

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and domination that the
prevailing model was how

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
do we conquer the marketplace,
overpower our competition,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
act in a way that will
assure victory in a very

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:90%
domination-oriented way.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.405 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I was
pretty good at that.

00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I went to interview Stacey
because I know she was very

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:10%
successful in the business
world, she was an entrepreneur.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:90%
She built companies.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:90%
She sold companies.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:90%
She did huge deals.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know she also had
this experience of something

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
was missing in her life.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.528 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STACEY LAWSON: There
was some natural tendency

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
or some natural integration
that wasn't happening.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I was living in compartments.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
During this whole
period, I actually

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
was also starting to
practice meditation,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.867 align:middle line:84%
and I would have these
deep intense experiences

00:14:04.867 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:90%
on the meditation cushion.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.807 align:middle line:90%
But that was my private life.

00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
done my business suit,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
pull my hair back in a
bun, put on my glasses,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
look as masculine as possible,
and go to close a $10 million

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.901 align:middle line:90%
deal.

00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I arrived at this question
what is the feminine because I

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:90%
didn't know.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the masculine was
because our culture's permeated

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
with that, but I actually didn't
know what the feminine was.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even
sure I still do,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that
that question was

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
something I needed to ask
because I didn't understand.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I decided to go to India.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
India to me represented
the feminine.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
You walk into an
intersection in India,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's in
the intersection.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:90%
There's camels.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:90%
There's dogs.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
There's ox carts.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:90%
There's motorcycles.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:90%
There's trucks.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:90%
There's people.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
There's-- and everybody is
in the intersection moving

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
together like one
mass of humanity.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's connected to
everyone, and it's a movement.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.444 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you have an agenda
and a plan that's linear

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
like then I'm going here
then I'm going here,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
India will mess you up.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that culture
expresses the feminine

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
in its dark aspects
and its light aspects

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and the aspects that serve
us and in the aspects

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
that we're terrified of.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:84%
You would see groups
of children destitute.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.208 align:middle line:84%
The poverty, it's
so heartbreaking.

00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
how to be with it.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:90%
They would surround me.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It was unbearable to be honest
with you, and I would run.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I ran from these
kids for five months,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
but I realized that if I'm going
to accept the wholeness of who

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I am and that is the feminine
doesn't reject anything,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
going to have

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to accept those things that
I saw as part of myself.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I stayed, and I
looked in their eyes.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:17:12.357 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.357 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In Europe, there's still a
connection in the unconscious

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
to the feminine, in the history
of the place of ancient culture

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:90%
that is still there.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.341 align:middle line:84%
When I came to America,
it was just another story.

00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not here.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It was not here.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:90%
It was not present.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You could not feel it
within the culture.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
In the Western culture
and in America,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
especially, I think women
had to compromise themselves.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
validate who they are,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
they had to adapt to the very
masculine mode in society

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and also a very strong
expectation what is a woman

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:90%
should be.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In this culture, unfortunately,
you have a Barbie doll,

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and you have those measurements
that you should fit into.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And your bum should certainly
fit in this perfect jeans,

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and then you are just right.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can walk into
street with confidence

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
because you know your
behind look great.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.945 align:middle line:84%
But really is this
what a woman is about?

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:29.715 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LLEWELLYN VAUGHAN-LEE: I
think part of the tragedy,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:84%
if you like, is that a lot
of women have been conned.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
They've been sold
something that is not true

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
either to them or to the
sacred feminine within them.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
North America, women

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly
liberated and more

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
free than in other
parts of the world.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet the freedom that
they have been given

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
is a masculine freedom.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
The ideals they have been
given, the patterns of behavior,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
the values they have
been given are masculine.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, they have
just been re-imprisoned.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They are promised independence
but masculine independence

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
real interdependence

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:90%
that belongs to the feminine.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way they have
been re-enslaved without even

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
being aware that they
have been re-enslaved.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>>ELINOR GADON:
For us in the West,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:10%
it means letting go of
so many things including

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:10%
the feminist agenda, which
is again about power,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:10%
but it's not always about the
right kind of use of power.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding of power is
the corporate understanding

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:90%
of power, power over.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
When you have power within,
you can used that power

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
in a way that not only
is beneficial for you

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
but for others because you have
tapped into the life force.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:90%
And that is something which is--

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:90%
transmits itself.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It's there like waves of
energy that come out of you.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Sadly in our way
in which women have

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
tried to reclaim for themselves
their own place in our culture

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
larger that required a
kind of quantum leap.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I fasted for a month,
and after the fast,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%
it became really clear.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I just got this hit that I
could jump in and let it all

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.810 align:middle line:84%
go and trust that
emptiness to carry my life.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that emptiness
embodies everything that

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:90%
was my own missing feminine.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So on the strength
of that clarity,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I destroyed all my work.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I gave everything I owned away.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I never asked
anyone for anything,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and I lived that
way for 15 years.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew the nature of
solid ground as a man,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:90%
as a willful, driven male.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I jumped off into a
whole other medium

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that I knew nothing
about, and I think

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
what I had to learn was
not necessarily to swim.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I needed to learn
the buoyancy of water

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
itself, which is the
feminine ability of nature

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
of the universe to
carry our lives.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:49.645 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANAT VAUGHAN-LEE: What does it
mean to have a feminine power?

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It is the yes, the yes to life.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:90%
The creation only has a yes.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:90%
How can be a no?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
You can see a beautiful
woman sometimes,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:90%
but she's so much in her head.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
it, but you can also

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
feel if you sit with
her that maybe--

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:84%
not every woman--
but maybe this woman

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:84%
there is another longing in her
to leave something else in her.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Or this part of her is
there, but it's blocked.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:46.415 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I've spent a lot of time
avoiding learning to listen

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.170 align:middle line:84%
inside because I always thought
that then I'd be a servant

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:84%
to my inner voice, and
I wanted what I wanted.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like a bit of a newbie
around listening to myself.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a struggle
every day, and I have

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to actually remember--
try to remember

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:90%
to ask myself the question.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:90%
What feels right?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
How can I orient myself
around what feels right to me?

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm right
at the place where I can

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:90%
remember to ask the question.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm just barely there though.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:01.237 align:middle line:84%
I'm barely at a place where
I can say how does this feel.

00:34:01.237 --> 00:34:07.698 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.698 --> 00:34:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ORLAND BISHOP: There's
a power in stillness.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.629 align:middle line:90%
I am available to myself.

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:90%
This is stillness.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
When I'm preparing to be
available to the world,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:90%
it's stillness.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is the feminine
in its highest expression.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm preparing myself
to be available

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:90%
to myself and to the world.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:42.781 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:84%
>>LLEWELLYN VAUGHAN-LEE: We
don't know what will be reborn.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
will be asked of us.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So to be prepared to
live in this state

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of acute vulnerability
really allows the divine

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:90%
to recreate itself.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTINE PAGE: It's a
heart that says to something

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that's never been done before.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Take a risk.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is
the part of me that

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.077 align:middle line:84%
will say nobody's doing
it out there but trust.

00:35:28.077 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's word--
the word courage comes

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.155 align:middle line:84%
from that is coeur, the heart,
a French word for the heart.

00:35:33.155 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't get
courage in our head.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.730 align:middle line:90%
We get courage in our heart.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:46.167 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAATA LYNN BARRON: Know
that you already know.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You know the answers to all
the questions that were asked.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:84%
You already know
just getting yourself

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:84%
into an aware enough
state that you can

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:90%
listen to how you would answer.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That you'll have to open up
space for that to happen.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Their lives are usually
pretty full and full of noise.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's how do you turn the
noise off in order to listen,

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and how do you do
that every day,

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.610 align:middle line:90%
not just every once in a while?

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.292 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.292 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some relief that
comes with learning how

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to integrate this part of
myself because the battering

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
of the mind is gone, this
you're not good enough,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what you're
doing questioning, questioning,

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:90%
questioning.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.560 align:middle line:90%
That's on the back burner.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:90%
And so there's spaciousness.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:57.060 align:middle line:84%
There's forgiveness for myself,
forgiveness for other beings.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say there's
more love in my life.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:32.737 align:middle line:90%


00:37:32.737 --> 00:37:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LLEWELLYN VAUGHAN-LEE: What
does this film mean to you?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that this
film is part of your journey.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what is
this story for you?

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.810 align:middle line:90%
What is this journey for you?

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.760 align:middle line:90%
What is this uncovering for you?

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:05.755 align:middle line:84%
>> The deepest call of my
heart, the deepest longing is

00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:06.555 align:middle line:90%
to serve.

00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.544 align:middle line:84%
Not that I don't
want stuff I do but--

00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.085 align:middle line:90%
That where I am now.

00:38:32.085 --> 00:38:50.695 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LLEWELLYN VAUGHAN-LEE:
What are these deep cycles

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of creation that
we're involved in?

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
If we can look for a moment
beyond cause and effect,

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.730 align:middle line:84%
beyond seeing a
problem and trying

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
to find a solution to something
deeper, to something more

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:90%
eternal, then maybe then can--

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.660 align:middle line:90%
a mystery can be born again.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:41:44.171 align:middle line:90%
