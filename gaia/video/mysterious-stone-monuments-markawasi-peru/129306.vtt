00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.697 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
High atop this remote plateau
in central Peru,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.535 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
hundreds of elusive shapes can
be found in the living rock.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.172 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
Some are recognizable
faces or animals.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:42.476 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
They even have names.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.111 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:25%
The rhino.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:49.016 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:21%
The dog.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:54.187 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
The Inca man.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:58.859 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
The Egyptian ruler.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.864 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:35%
The sea lions.

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:08.602 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:31%
The condors.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:15.475 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:31%
The griffin.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.277 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;I like the fact that
it's a huge head.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.447 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
That reads very well today.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;For some, these so-called
monuments are nothing more than

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.754 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
works of nature interpreted
by an overactive imagination,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.824 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
while for others the figures on
Markawasi are evidence of

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:36.363 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
a long lost civilization,
a culture which left its mark

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:40.400 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
in stone so they would not
be forgotten by history.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.811 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
There is a real mystery here.

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:55.349 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Could nature alone have produced
these sublime images?

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.486 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
The mysterious stone figures
of Markawasi are unique,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:04.725 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
even in Peru, a country known
for its awe-inspiring monuments.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:09.129 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
Yet here at 12,500 feet
in the Andes Mountains

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.399 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
is a mystery
of a different kind.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:16.403 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
No statues have ever been found
on the neighboring peaks,

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:20.073 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
but on the unusually flat
mountaintop called Markawasi,

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:23.276 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
hundreds of images
have been identified.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.645 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
Some of the figures
are familiar:

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.781 align:middle line:85% position:12% size:16%
a dog,

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.218 align:middle line:85% position:12% size:16%
a pig,

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:36.523 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
or a frog riding a turtle?

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.992 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
Yet many are reminiscent
of images found

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.395 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
only in remote parts
of the world

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
or distant periods of antiquity.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.932 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
A lion from Africa,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.635 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
a pharaoh from Egypt.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.742 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
How can this be?

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.182 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
To get to the bottom
of this mystery,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.584 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
a team of researchers has
gathered the best knowledge

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:07.654 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
and resources available
about this site,

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:10.757 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
which was virtually unknown
to the English-speaking world

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.692 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
a decade ago.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.363 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
We will meet the original
discoverer of Markawasi.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.966 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And in an exclusive interview,
hear his theory of who built

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:24.938 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
these enigmatic monuments
at a time before history began.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:28.542 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We will follow the investigation
of a world-renowned geologist,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.278 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
and hear his scientific
explanation of how

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.814 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
the structures
came to be formed.

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:36.183 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
We will hear from
an independent investigator

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:39.086 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
who has passionately
researched Markawasi,

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:42.322 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
and become one of
its greatest champions.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.692 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We'll watch as a
preeminent Peruvian archeologist

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.328 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
explores the Inca burial
chambers found on the

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
highest promontory at Markawasi.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:55.135 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And we'll meet a high-stakes
commodity trader from Chicago

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.337 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
who has excavated a hidden cave

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.340 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
on the western banks
of the plateau to find out

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.410 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
if the
legend of Sacsajili? is true.

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.216 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Computer graphics will aid
in the analysis of these

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:12.719 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
ephemeral figures
by enhancing without changing

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.955 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
their mysterious forms.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:19.626 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Perhaps the time has come for
Markawasi to reveal its secrets,

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:27.801 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;There's a large monster,
huge head, snout at the front.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:32.506 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
A very large beady eye,
and a very large mouth,

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.407 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
with probably some
big teeth sticking out.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.443 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
&gt;&gt;In his professional life,
Peter Schneider is

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.246 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
an internationally known
radio personality.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.515 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
His broadcasts have examined

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.718 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
many of Peru's ancient
mysteries, including a 20-year

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.754 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
investigation of Markawasi.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.625 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;The Markawasi Plateau

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.262 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
is about 3 kilometers long
and one kilometer wide.

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:57.564 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
As you walk around

00:04:57.564 --> 00:05:01.334 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
you see all these figures.
Small ones, large ones,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:04.237 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
some 10 feet high,
some 20, some 30 feet high.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:08.275 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
And they're all
spread around randomly.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:09.543 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
So you could come across

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.611 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:23%
a sphinx,

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.313 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
then you could come across

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.282 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
an animal
just 10 or 20 feet away.

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Then you would go around the
corner and find another animal,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.153 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
or you'd find the
head of a human being.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.989 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
So all the statues,
all the figures

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:28.361 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
which are well over 200, are all
concentrated on the plateau.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.431 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Perhaps the most famous
of all the statues is called

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.134 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
The Monument,
or Head of Humanity.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:38.271 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
It stands 85 feet high,
and it is claimed that

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:42.876 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
several races of man are visible
in this one gigantic statue.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.214 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
On its western side,

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:50.450 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
three distinct races
have been identified.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.852 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
A caucasian man faces right.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.023 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
A semitic man, 

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.492 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
with prominent nose
and deep-set eyes

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:28%
faces left.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
Near the center,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.270 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
a small skull-like face
could be negroid.

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:14.507 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
On the eastern side is

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:19.412 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
an asian profile,
according to some observers.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:23.383 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;The Head of Humanity
has eight different faces

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.752 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
depending on where
you're standing.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.355 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In front of it, on the side,
or behind it, or even

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
overlooking it from the top.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.426 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
The Head of Humanity
is as clear as a bell.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:39.299 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
You see a huge head
looking out towards the right.

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:45.071 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
You see hair, you see the skin,
the nose, the mouth, the eye,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:49.776 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
chin and the neck.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:53.179 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So when you look at
the Head of Humanity, you think,

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:57.183 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
Wow, now what is
this huge face doing

00:06:57.183 --> 00:07:01.788 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
right up in the mountains
of Peru at 4000 meters?

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.491 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
It shouldn't be here,
and yet there it is, staring

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.127 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
right at you.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:10.764 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
That is the big mystery,
and the most exhilarating

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:15.168 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
feeling, to stand there
and look at this huge face

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.905 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
built out of stone many, many
thousands of years ago.

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.776 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
The mystery continues
when one travels

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.246 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
around the plateau and discovers
recognizable figures

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:30.550 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
which were unknown to Peru
till modern times.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.987 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Many of the statues resemble
animals from other continents,

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:37.891 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
and mythological figures
from other cultures.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
Viewers have identified

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.661 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
an African lion,

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.931 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
an Easter Island moai,

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:49.569 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
the Egyptian goddess Thueris,

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.772 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
and even a species of tortoise
that has been extinct

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:56.376 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
for millions of years.

00:07:56.376 --> 00:08:00.547 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;On the Markawasi Plateau,
are a great number of figures.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:05.952 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Some of them recognizable as
being from other continents:

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.888 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
the Asian continent,
the African continent.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.592 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
So how is it possible
that ancient man,

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:17.597 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
or the ancient civilization that
supposedly built these figures,

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:21.835 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
were able to travel
around the world?

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.471 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It could only mean,
the only possible logical answer

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:28.341 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
is that there was interaction
between Egypt and Peru

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.778 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
thousands and thousands of years
ago. That there was interaction

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.748 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
between the ancient African
people and the ancient South

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:39.552 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
American people, even from as
far away as Asia, there was

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:43.690 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
connection between the Asians
and the Peruvians.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.228 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Maybe we were really, as Bob
Marley said, one world.

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:50.163 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
The burning question
of the last 20 years

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.032 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
since I've been investigating
the Markawasi figures

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:57.837 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
has been whether they are real,
in other words, whether they

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:02.041 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
were made by an ancient race
who used to live here in Peru,

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.179 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
or whether they are
just erosion.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.651 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
To answer this question, Peter
put together an expedition

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.889 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
to investigate the stone
monuments of Markawasi.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:19.125 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
At the end of the dry season,
in August, the team set off

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:22.462 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
for eight days and nights
on the plateau.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:28.802 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Peru is located on the Pacific
coast of South America,

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:34.541 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
surrounded by Ecuador, Columbia,
Brazil, Bolivia and Chile.

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
Within its borders are

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.149 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
coastal regions, deserts,
jungles and high mountains.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.286 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
50 miles northeast of
the capital city, Lima,

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.756 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
on the westernmost edge
of the Peruvian Andes,

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.258 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
sits the Markawasi Plateau.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:57.430 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
At 12,500 feet in elevation,
travel to Markawasi requires

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.433 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
many different forms
of transportation.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.238 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
The first leg of the journey,
from Lima to Chosica,

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:09.242 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
was a fairly luxurious ride
through the countryside.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:12.479 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
At the bustling town of Chosica,
the comfortable tour bus

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:15.582 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
had to be exchanged for
a more rugged vehicle

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:18.852 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
better suited to negotiate
the narrow roads and switchbacks

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:22.021 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that wind there way up the
mighty Andes Mountains.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.525 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The final destination before
reaching the summit of Markawasi

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:29.162 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
was the small town
of San Pedro de Casta.

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:32.899 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;The little village
of San Pedro de Casta,

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:40.106 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
which has 1,300 inhabitants, is
at 3,200 meters above sea level,

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:42.442 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
and the road ends there.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.879 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So if you go there you will get
off the bus at that point.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.213 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
And from there onwards

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:52.452 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
it's either on foot, on donkey
or on a horse.

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:55.622 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
In San Pedro de Casta, it's your
last chance to get a shower,

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:59.425 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
to get a loaf of bread
from the local bakery,

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:03.463 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and that's your last stop
before the adventure begins.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:09.302 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;After an arduous 5 hour drive
from Lima, the weary travelers

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:12.071 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
were greeted with a joyous
festival celebrating

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:15.074 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
their arrival,
and the opening of a new bakery.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.876 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
[people singing]

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.224 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
Peter was the guest of honor,

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
as he was instrumental in the
founding of the bakery.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.462 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
[people singing]

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:54.380 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The team got a good nights rest,
and began preparations to ascend

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
the remaining 3,000 feet.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.886 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Virtually everything they would
need had to be brought up

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
by mules or horses.

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The villagers know well that the

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:06.893 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
3 hour climb to the plateau
must be concluded well before

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:11.331 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
sunset when the temperatures
plunge to below freezing.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.436 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
While the guides headed up the
mountain with the team's

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.872 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
equipment and provisions,
Peter began watching the skies

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.275 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
for the arrival of the
helicopter and

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:25.278 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
the last two members
of the expedition.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.082 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;We are standing here in the
football field of the village

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:34.520 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
of San Pedro de Casta,
up in the Andes Mountains.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.291 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We're waiting for
a well-known American geologist,

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.528 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Dr. Schoch, and his assistant,
Logan, to arrive by helicopter

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
in a few minutes.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.568 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And I've invited Dr. Schoch to
come up to Markawasi to have

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:52.772 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
a look at the stone figures,
and give us his expert opinion.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.579 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
&gt;&gt;Peter greeted

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.715 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Dr. Robert Schoch, a geologist
from Boston University,

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.951 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
and his assistant, Logan.

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:12.425 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Dr. Robert Schoch has a PhD in
Geology from Yale University,

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:16.396 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
and is a professor of geology
at Boston University.

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.232 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He is perhaps best known for his
research on the weathering

00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:22.135 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
of the Great Sphinx of Egypt,
and his conclusion that

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.470 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
the Sphinx could be
thousands of years older

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.608 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
than history tells us, based on
an analysis of the erosion.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.112 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;I invited Dr. Robert Schoch
to visit Markawasi because

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:38.384 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
we need somebody who really has
an objective view.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:43.189 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
And Dr. Robert Schoch has
a worldwide reputation,

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:48.461 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
he's a geologist, and he's
an expert in ancient stones.

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:53.666 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So Dr. Schoch is absolutely the
perfect person to tell us

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:59.605 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
whether Markawasi is real,
or if it's just nature.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:03.609 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
So I came with an open mind,
honestly not convinced

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:07.914 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
that these sculptures, and I use
that term loosely, were actually

00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
human-carved artifacts versus
natural erosional features.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.556 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I came, I wanted to see what
things might look like

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:17.657 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:35%
on the ground.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.794 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
In order to better understand
the Markawasi mystery,

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.098 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
we must meet the man
credited with its discovery,

00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:29.602 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
a Peruvian archeologist
named Daniel Ruzo.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.838 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
This rare interview
was filmed at his home

00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:36.342 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
in Cuernavaca, Mexico,
when Dr. Ruzo was 91 years old.

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.145 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
His wife, Corola, translates
what was to be

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:42.215 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
his last interview.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.851 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
These are the first pictures
that he saw of Markawasi

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:46.519 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
in his friend's house.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:49.155 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Finally, his friend gave the
picture to him, and he decided

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:52.959 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
to organize an expedition.

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.395 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
While Ruzo was often credited
with the discovery of Markawasi,

00:14:56.395 --> 00:15:01.234 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
its mysterious origins go back
half a century before.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.137 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
It all started with the vision
of Peruvian scholar

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:06.305 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
Pedro Astete.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:09.709 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In 1905, Astete dreamed of a
forgotten ancient culture

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:11.644 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
called the Masma.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.348 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
According to Astete,
the Masma were wiped out

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:20.052 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
by the great flood some 6,500
years ago, but not before

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.388 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
they left their traces
on the planet.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.894 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
His dream became reality
when his scholarly research

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:31.297 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
confirmed the existence
of the Masma.

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.599 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
They were mentioned in the Bible
and known to the Romans

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:38.304 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
as a race whose history extended
beyond time immemorial.

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:42.642 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
Ruzo met Astete in 1924,

00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:47.413 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and using symbology and ancient
texts, they deduced that the

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.416 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Masma culture left prehistoric
stone sculptures around the

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.719 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
world to mark what they believed
were occult treasures

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:56.856 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
located in subterranean caves.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:03.596 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
For the rest of his life,
Ruzo searched the world

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.632 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
for evidence of the Masma
culture and the occult treasure

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.669 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
that they left behind.

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:16.175 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
When Ruzo first saw the photo
of the so-called Inca head,

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:19.312 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
he recognized immediately
that this could be evidence

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.248 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
of the elusive Masma culture.

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:26.886 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
In 1952, Ruzo mounted an
expedition to see for himself,

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:31.324 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and made the strenuous trek
up to the Markawasi Plateau.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:34.126 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
When he first saw the Inca head
he could not believe

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:38.264 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
the sheer magnitude and artistry
of the figure.

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But upon examining it from all
angles, he discovered

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.803 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
several different faces,
which represented

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:48.374 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
the four races of humanity.
He called this statue

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:52.511 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
The Monument of Humanity.

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:57.350 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Along with a local campesino
named Don Manuel,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.853 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Ruzo began to investigate
the rest of the plateau.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:04.323 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
To his amazement they found
hundreds of representations

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.526 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
of animals
from remote parts of the planet,

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
mythological figures
from various cultures,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.866 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
and bizarre effigies
that defied explanation.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.102 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
Over the next 8 years,

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:19.472 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Ruzo continued his
field studies at Markawasi

00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:22.775 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
while poring over ancient texts
and occult writings.

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:27.246 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
He concluded that Markawasi was
where the Masma culture

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.815 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
survived a cataclysmic flood 

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.884 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
by living in
subterranean tunnels.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:36.489 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Unfortunately, he was never able
to excavate the tunnels

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:41.294 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
he believed existed
under the Markawasi Plateau.

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:46.866 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Today, Peter Schneider
continues to explore Markawasi.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:51.704 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
As the leader of the expedition,
his immediate concern was

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:55.608 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
to get everybody up to the top
of the plateau before the sunset

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:58.811 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and the temperatures plunged
to below freezing.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:06.452 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
After 20 years of searching,
Peter is hoping that this team

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:11.290 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
will finally put to rest some of
Markawasi's greatest mysteries.

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:16.162 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Coming up to Markawasi,
we approached it by horse in

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:17.997 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
the afternoon, late afternoon.

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:21.167 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So we came up the northern end,
and approached initially what

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.803 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
has sometimes been called

00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:24.971 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
The Inca head, other times

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:26.238 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
it's been called things like

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
The Monument to Humanity--

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:31.477 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
a huge, I use the term loosely,

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.646 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
stone sculpture.

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:36.615 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that was the first of these,
using the term loosely,

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.318 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
sculptures or artifacts
that I saw.

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.253 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
Honestly, I didn't know
what to think of it.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.889 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It was late, we were all tired.

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.425 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
But it looked pretty
interesting.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:49.295 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Take a look at it here.
There's supposed to be

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.430 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
a face on the left,
a face on the right.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.533 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
There's, like, a little face
there, another face there.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.303 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;They're supposed to represent
a lot of different cultures.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:03.509 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;So, yeah, let's go here
and look, and continue.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.778 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Oh, yeah, here you can
see it even better, actually,

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:11.817 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
don't you? Right in here.
Looks very nice. Look at that.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.753 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
You can see the face on the
right side, you can see...

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:15.855 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
Oh look at the huge nose.

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:20.192 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Well especially on the face to
the way right, it does seem that

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.761 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
there's a natural fault line

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:24.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
accentuated along the cheekbone,

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.598 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
and someone may have just gone

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
in there and chipped out,

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.201 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
like you were talking about
earlier with tools

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
to accentuate a nose shape.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:35.007 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;I see what you mean. Working
along that natural weak zone,

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.443 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
and just taking it right off.

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And if someone saw that shape
and said, this is starting

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.916 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
to look like a face, but they
wanted to really make it look

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
more like a face, that would be
the natural thing to do.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.388 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;What are the chances that a
rock could weather

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.490 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
in that sort of pattern along
those... right with

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.260 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the nose and the mouth
and what seems to be a chin.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.528 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
&gt;&gt;Certainly you don't

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.963 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
see something like that
on a regular basis.

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.966 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
On the other hand we do see
things like...

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.868 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
In America, the things
that they will call

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.804 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
"The old man in the mountain"

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.907 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that everyone agrees is a
natural feature, but looks

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:09.708 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
a lot like a human face.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:13.345 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
If this is absolutely natural,
without any artificiality,

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.916 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
without any retouching to it,
it's still incredibly unusual.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.618 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
I mean, there seems to be
a face there, in my opinion,

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:25.024 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
whether it's totally natural
or if it's a combination of

00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:28.127 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
natural with some
artificial retouching.

00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:30.930 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
Now why do you see this
coloration difference

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
right around the area that looks
carved, or that could be carved?

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.402 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
See, I think that's very
important in this case

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:39.105 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
because that different
coloration, to me, it looks like

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:44.210 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
it means that rock is fresher,
it's been exposed more recently.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.212 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
I mean, that is still
a very old surface,

00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:49.882 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
so even if this
was occurring by some kind of

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:51.717 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
human intervention...

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:55.087 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
it's hard for me to estimate
without more data, without more

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.456 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
comparative analysis here.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.425 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
But I would think we're talking

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.461 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
at least hundreds if not
thousands of years ago.

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:07.066 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
So I think we're talking,
we're talking old either way.

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.869 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
&gt;&gt;So Dr. Schoch,

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:12.037 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
have you had the chance
to look at the statue here?

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.839 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;Well, it's been nice.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.442 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I spent the morning and early
afternoon really getting a feel

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.378 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
for the northern area
of the plateau here.

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:23.582 align:start line:74% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;I mean, I look at this
and it doesn't take

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.185 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
that much imagination
to see a face, a profile,

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:27.887 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
the face on the right side.

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:31.457 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Another profile of a face
on the left side, I think I see.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.093 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Yes, that's correct, yeah.
And then, if you walk around,

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:35.728 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
we're going to find more faces.
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:39.265 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Over the next few days, Peter
shows Dr. Schoch and the team

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:43.035 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
some of the other images
that Markawasi has to offer.

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:48.140 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Look at this here.
The Prophet.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.944 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We have in front of us the most
majestic of all the figures here

00:21:51.944 --> 00:21:54.246 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
in Markawasi.

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:58.851 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
We have a human head.
A male figure. And very clearly

00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:04.557 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
you see his eyes, and the pupil
of his eye. His eyes are open.

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:11.463 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
You see a long, Roman nose. As
you look down you see his beard.

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:15.935 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is an old man. You can see
the wrinkles on his face.

00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:20.606 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Then you can see the hair line,
you can see his whole head.

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:26.212 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And he's wearing some kind of a
headband around the top of

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
his head, which is very clear.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.382 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And he has a ponytail.
You can actually see the hair

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:34.353 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
tied up in a ponytail
on the back of his head.

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:37.289 align:start line:79% position:17% size:41%
He's looking out
over the valley.

00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:41.427 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;While Peter is very familiar
with the faces and figures

00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:45.364 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
having studied them for 20
years, Schoch remains committed

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:48.901 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
to an objective examination of
the geological features

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.469 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
of Markawasi.

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.705 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
If these images are
representative of

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.874 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
diverse world cultures,
it would seem to support

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:59.245 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Ruzo's theory of an ancient
civilization that was capable of

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:01.146 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
world travel.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:02.881 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
What is at stake?

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.784 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Peter thinks it may be time
to rewrite the history books.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:11.290 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
But is he right? And will Schoch
be able to supply the answer?

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:16.562 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
One of the most intriguing
aspects of Markawasi is the

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:19.465 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
possibility that some of the
monuments resemble icons

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:23.202 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
depicted by cultures
from around the world.

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:26.639 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Dr. Ruzo, who studied
ancient texts and symbology,

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:30.409 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
believed that whoever made the
monuments at Markawasi had a

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:34.079 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
direct knowledge of the
ancient civilization of Egypt.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.616 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
During an early expedition Ruzo
discovered on the southern end

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:42.221 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
of the plateau what he felt
was proof of this theory.

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:45.758 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Carved on a 200 foot outcrop
of granite, he identified

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
two Egyptian dieties.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.965 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Thueris, the goddess of birth,
personified as a hippopotamous,

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:56.168 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
and Sobek, the god of
death and rebirth,

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.704 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
personified as a crocodile.

00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:02.675 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Amazingly, these two figures
are often seen concurrently,

00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
with Sobec behind Thueris,

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
suggesting birth is followed
by death and rebirth,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.685 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
as depicted in these
New Kingdom hieroglyphics.

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:14.153 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Well you could say it's

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:18.590 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
the Egyptian goddess Thueris,
god of fertility.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.560 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
But we see some ears
sticking out on the top...

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.395 align:start line:74% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Right
&gt;&gt;...and then the face...

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:26.332 align:start line:74% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;...with another eye,
and a long snout...

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:29.301 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;...and a large, huge mouth.
&gt;&gt;Right, exactly.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:34.940 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Then the whole body,
which is kind of pregnant.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.375 align:start line:79% position:13% size:21%
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.
&gt;&gt;Right?

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:37.976 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Because she must be pregnant.
&gt;&gt;The pregnant hippo

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.612 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
often represents
the goddess of fertility.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Behind the hippo figure

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.688 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
we see a crocodile figure,
do you see that?

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.357 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Uh huh, yeah I do.
Right behind there.

00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:56.995 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;And Ruzo associates this
crocodile figure with Sobek.

00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:59.698 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;Oh, the god...
the Egyptian god Sobek,

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:04.670 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
that has to do with death
and the deceased and,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.439 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
actually, rebirth again.
In fact, that would make a nice

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:10.776 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
connection if that's correct,
if Ruzo's correct, between...

00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:13.812 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And you see that often in Egypt
where the fertility goddess,

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.949 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
the fertility goddess, birth,
is followed by the

00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
goddess essentially of death.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.488 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
So death and birth, rebirth,
resurrection, death again.

00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:26.291 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Essentially the life cycle,
I mean it's a very common motif

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.727 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
that you see in ancient Egypt
on many of the temples like

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:32.097 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
the Temple of Dendara, and
other great temples in Egypt.

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.901 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
But, these are African animals--
we are in Peru.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:38.337 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
These are Egyptian motifs--

00:25:38.337 --> 00:25:42.975 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
ancient Egyptian motifs.
We are in Peru. An ocean away.

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.611 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
What's going on here?

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:48.981 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;On a desolate island in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean,

00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:52.751 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
an ancient culture left behind
gigantic statues that have

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:56.622 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
intrigued researchers
for hundreds of years.

00:25:56.622 --> 00:26:00.793 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The moai of Easter Island exist
nowhere else on the planet.

00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:05.264 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Or do they?
Dr. Ruzo discovered what he felt

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:07.366 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
was an ancient replica
of an Easter Island moai

00:26:07.366 --> 00:26:10.569 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
on the Markawasi Plateau.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He recognized many similarities,
including the characteristic

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.943 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
top knot of stone perched
on top of the head.

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.778 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:31%
Was there an

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:24.450 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
ancient connection between
Easter Island, Peru and Egypt?

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.587 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Ruzo, like his contemporary,
the Norwegian, Thor Heyerdahl,

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:32.891 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
felt there was. In Heyerdahl's
famous Kon Tiki expedition,

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:35.394 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
he demonstrated
a possible connection

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:38.597 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
between Peru and Easter Island
by sailing across

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:42.501 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
the Pacific Ocean
in a boat made of balsa.

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:46.505 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
In his later Ra II expedition,
Heyerdahl sailed across

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:49.341 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
the Atlantic Ocean
from North Africa to

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.344 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
an island off the coast
of South America.

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:55.547 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
This boat was made of
a papyrus reed called totora.

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:59.618 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Today the totora reed is found
only in three places in the

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:06.592 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
world-- Easter Island, Egypt,
and Lake Titicaca in Peru.

00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:12.097 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
In one of those rare moments of
discovery, Peter captured

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:14.900 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
on film what he feels
is a likeness of an

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.936 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
Egyptian woman's
delicate features.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.776 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Another image from Markawasi
that Dr. Ruzo felt strengthens

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:28.580 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
the Egyptian connection is what
he called The Pharaoh.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.950 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;So here we have a very, very
curious figure.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:37.556 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
To me and maybe to you, too, it
looks like an Egyptian pharaoh.

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:41.527 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
If you look on the left hand
side you'll see the nemes,

00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:44.696 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
which is like a big headgear
which covered the ears of

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.266 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
all the Egyptian pharaohs.

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:50.135 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
If you look further up to the
top of his head you'll see,

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:54.072 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
like, a little snake sticking
out, which looks like,

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
we used to call that the uraeus.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:58.777 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
When you go down the face you'll
see his eyes, you see his nose.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:02.347 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
You'll see his frowning mouth,
and below that

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:07.920 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
a little goatee beard.
Again, typical of a pharaoh.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.624 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
So I ask myself, what is an
Egyptian pharaoh doing here?,

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:16.862 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
And, was there contact
thousands of years ago

00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:20.432 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
between the ancient Peruvians
and the ancient Egyptians?

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:23.902 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruzo theorized
that the Masma, a

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:28.373 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
technologically evolved culture,
existed before a great flood

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:32.511 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
devastated the Earth
6,500 years ago.

00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:35.647 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The current model of mankind's
development says that

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:39.217 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
no advanced civilization
existed at this time.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:42.387 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But controversial new evidence
in Egypt suggests

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:45.691 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that civilization could be
much older.

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:49.428 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Dr. Robert Schoch is perhaps
best known for his re-dating

00:28:49.428 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:57.336 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
According to Egyptologists,
the Sphinx is 4,500 years old.

00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:00.439 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Dr. Schoch contends that
the body of the Great Sphinx

00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:03.475 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
has been massively eroded
by rainwater.

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.877 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
However, there has been
no significant rainfall

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:08.981 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
in the desert
for over 6,000 years.

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:12.184 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Therefore Schoch concludes
the Great Sphinx is

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:16.822 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
at least 6,000 years old,
over 1,500 years older than

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:19.491 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
experts currently believe.

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:22.227 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
What advanced culture, then,
was responsible for

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:25.397 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
building the Sphinx?

00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:29.501 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Could it have been the Masma
civilization theorized by Ruzo?

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:39.111 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Well, we've seen several
African animals here

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.646 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
on the plateau of Markawasi.
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:42.114 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
But now I have something
very special for you.

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.549 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;OK?
&gt;&gt;The African Queen.

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.586 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;The African Queen?
&gt;&gt;The African Queen.

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:51.423 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Right up on the mountain
in front of us facing left

00:29:51.423 --> 00:29:56.461 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
you see a fabulous picture
of a lady, the African lady,

00:29:56.461 --> 00:30:01.767 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
with her forehead, her little,
small nose, her mouth, her chin.

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:04.569 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And the whole figure is
sitting on top of a large rock,

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.538 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
which would be her body.
&gt;&gt;I see it.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.407 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;And it looks like
her hair is pulled back.

00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:10.809 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
&gt;&gt;Yes.
It looks like she has

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.545 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
a large headdress, which gives
her the queenlike appearance.

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:21%
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.314 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
But you know what her profile

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
looks like to me? The profile of

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:19.951 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
the Great Sphinx in Egypt.

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:21.186 align:middle line:85% position:12% size:16%
&gt;&gt;Wow.

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.888 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;Very much so.
It reminds me of that.

00:30:22.888 --> 00:30:27.492 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
And our forensic expert
identified it as an African.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.796 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
When I saw that face,
immediately it reminded me

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:34.599 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
of my old friend,
the profile of the Great Sphinx.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:38.270 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Very, very similar.
Now, is there a real connection

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.806 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
here? Could there be
some kind of connection between

00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:44.242 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
Peru and ancient Egypt?

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:46.044 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
I would say it's very weak

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:49.381 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
evidence in and of itself,
in isolation.

00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:51.717 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But put together with
lots of other evidence we have

00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:55.187 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
for intercontinental connections
in ancient times,

00:30:55.187 --> 00:30:57.389 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
it seem to be just one more
piece of the puzzle.

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:59.458 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
Fantastic.
&gt;&gt;That was fantastic.

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:04.563 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;In two strategic locations
on the Markawasi Plateau

00:31:04.563 --> 00:31:09.201 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
are ancient ruins, which have
been identified as Incan.

00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:12.904 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Were the Incas responsible
for the statues on Markawasi?

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:17.442 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
To answer this question, Peter
invited Dr. Marino Sanchez,

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:20.879 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
the head of archeology at
the famous Inca stronghold

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.081 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
of Machu Picchu.

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.050 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
Dr. Sanchez wrote his
doctoral thesis

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.788 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
on Markawasi's irrigation system
and the people who developed it.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.359 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;We are in
the city of gods where

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:38.530 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the ancient Markawasi people
built these structures.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.867 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
They made them in
these high places,

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:43.201 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
and their dead were buried

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:46.304 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
in these buildings called
chulpas.

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:49.341 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
All of these chulpas
have been constructed

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:53.411 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
in a very simple manner.
They have stone roofs,

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:59.351 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
but if we use a compass, we see
the sun is rising from there.

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:03.889 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
It will enter the windows
and energize the dead.

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:07.692 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
For us they are dead, but for
the ancients they were living

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:12.998 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
beings, spirits who watched over
the people of the city.

00:32:12.998 --> 00:32:17.335 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;According to Dr. Sanchez,
these people were not the Incas,

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:22.574 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
but predecessors of the Incas
called Wallallo Carwancho, who

00:32:22.574 --> 00:32:27.579 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
subdivided into the Markawasi
culture around 800 AD.

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:29.481 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
They were a group of
astronomers and priests

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:31.850 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
who controlled the flow of
precious water

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.553 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
to the farmers below.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.557 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
The important thing to know

00:32:38.557 --> 00:32:41.593 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
is how the environment
with these natural figures

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:45.831 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
impregnated itself in the
consciousness of the people.

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:52.037 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
These people held them
as sacred things, spirits,

00:32:52.037 --> 00:32:55.373 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
gods of the sacred cosmos.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:02.747 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;While Dr. Sanchez maintains
that the images of Markawasi

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:06.651 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
were probably in existence many
years before the Inca,

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:11.323 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
the origin of these figures
remains a mystery.

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:15.727 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ruzo and Pedro Astete
theorize that the stone

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:18.763 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
sculptures of Markawasi were
markers left behind by

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:21.533 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
the lost Masma culture.

00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:24.669 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
The Markawasi Plateau, they
proposed, is the location

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:28.173 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
of subterranean chambers
which provided refuge

00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:32.043 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
from a cataclysmic flood,
and a repository for records

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:35.247 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
of their advanced civilization.

00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:38.183 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Today the search for these
chambers and the records

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:43.555 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
they could hold continues
due to one man's obsession.

00:33:43.555 --> 00:33:46.658 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Alan Matthew is an international
commodities trader.

00:33:46.658 --> 00:33:50.528 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Each day he trades millions of
bushels of grain and soybeans

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:55.333 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the high stakes world of the
Chicago Commodities Exchange.

00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:00.505 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
But for the last 18 years
his idea of relaxation

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:03.141 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
has been climbing to the top
of the Markawasi Plateau

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:06.511 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
to excavate a site known
to locals as 

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:10.582 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
The Infernino, or in English,
The Inferno.

00:34:10.582 --> 00:34:14.586 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
This unusual crevice near an
escarpment on the plateau's

00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:17.989 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
southern edge is rumored to be
a possible entrance to the

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.358 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
hidden chambers of the Masma.

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:25.764 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;After about 18 years of coming
here and hearing the mythology,

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:30.568 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
I decided that I'd go for it
and start digging, and see

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.437 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
if there was, you know,
anything down there.

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.172 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
&gt;&gt;Yeah.
&gt;&gt;And as you can see,

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:38.710 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
we've taken out literally
tons of dirt, massive rocks.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.278 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
We're down to about

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:44.316 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
38 and a half, 39 feet
from the surface here.

00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:48.753 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;OK. I mean, what I see here
geologically is you've got

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:51.790 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
some kind of weak thrown-up
fault, some kind of natural

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:56.328 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
opening in this igneous rock,
and it seems like this would

00:34:56.328 --> 00:35:00.031 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
have filled in with dirt,
filled in with soil and debris.

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:02.968 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And what you've done is you've
taken that out, taken out a lot

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:05.737 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
of loose rocks
and been going down.

00:35:05.737 --> 00:35:08.373 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And when I look down in there,
as we were down in there,

00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:11.776 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean, there's... you could go
down further, I think.

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.610 align:start line:74% position:15% size:35%
&gt;&gt;Oh, yeah, 
a lot further.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.312 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;You could go down
a lot further.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Now, what you expect to find,
I don't know.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.118 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Yeah. Well, what I expected
to find was really what

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:21.720 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
Don Manuel expected to find.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.459 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
I mean I started this based on
his undying belief that

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.894 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
there's a cave structure there.

00:35:29.894 --> -00:59:59.999 align:start line:74% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Now you said that he went down
this very spot before.

-00:59:59.999 --> 00:35:35.066 align:start line:85% position:13% size:21%
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.736 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;And you also told me, I
believe, when we were

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:39.204 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
down there, that in some cases
you would hit pockets where

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
fresh air seemed to come out.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:45.076 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
Yeah, we hit pockets
about maybe this wide,

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:47.512 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
and the air would just be
flowing out from it.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:50.081 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
And then, of course,
because they believe

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.751 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
in mountain spirits,
they'd immediately throw in

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:55.887 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
some coca leaves and smoke some
cigarettes and throw that in.

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.957 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;As a sacrifice?
&gt;&gt;As a sacrifice, a ritual, and

00:35:58.957 --> 00:36:00.959 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
then they'd start to dig again.
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:03.161 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;But the fact that you got
fresh air coming out suggests

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:06.531 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
that maybe there is something,
some kind of system

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:10.769 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
or some kind of pockets.
&gt;&gt;Well, it's so funny that all

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:13.605 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
these years they had this myth
that if you jumped over it,

00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:16.908 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
something bad would happen to
you, or something.

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:19.511 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Oh my gosh. I can imagine.
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.447 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Don Manuel tells
the legend of the Infernino

00:36:22.447 --> 00:36:27.452 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and accounts of hapless
travelers who got too close.

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:32.057 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Very well. There is a legend
about the Infernino.

00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
They are two rocks
not too far apart.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.564 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
If a person tries to jump across
from one side to the other,

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:42.834 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the rocks would open and the
person would fall inside

00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:44.469 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
into the abyss.

00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:47.238 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
After a few days,
the person would come out

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:49.307 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
in the valley below.

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:52.610 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The person would never be quite
the same afterward.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:57.615 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
He would be half crazy.
This is the Infernino.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.350 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;I always jumped over it for
fun.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.618 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Just to see what would happen?
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:04.556 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;That's good. I'm glad!

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:11.830 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Since 1952, when Markawasi was
first visited by Daniel Ruzo,

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
thousands of travelers have come
to San Pedro and made the trek

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.269 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
up to the plateau.

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.338 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Sure, working here with the
organization I've gotten the

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
opportunity to go visit several
of the villages in the area, and

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.609 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
even visit some of the ruins,
because most of the villages

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:27.712 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
have neighboring Inca ruins,
and I hadn't seen

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.348 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
anything like Markawasi anywhere
in Peru, for that matter.

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:33.251 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
So many different animals

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:37.222 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and faces and seemingly sculpted
rocks appearing up there.

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:40.258 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
It just seems like
there's too many of them

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
to sort of rule out the
possibility that they were

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.229 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
sculpted at one point in time.

00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:48.233 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;I'm not sure if
some civilization created these

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:52.470 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
figures on the plateau
in Markawasi.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.442 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
But I am sure this place is
sacred for these people.

00:37:57.442 --> 00:38:01.546 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And the first time that I came
here, for me it was the same.

00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:03.848 align:middle line:85% position:12% size:18%
Sacred.

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:07.152 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;In addition to the claims of
lost cultures and gigantic stone

00:38:07.152 --> 00:38:10.788 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
monuments, there are purported
healing energies said to

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
emanate from the plateau itself.

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:20.198 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
High atop a granite outcrop
overlooking an ancient lagoon,

00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:23.935 align:start line:79% position:17% size:41%
there is a cross
etched in stone.

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.940 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
It has also been claimed
that the center of this cross

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.944 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
marks a vortex of telluric
energies, which can be detected

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:34.913 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
with dowsing rods.

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:37.482 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Dowsing rods are simple tools
that are said to amplify

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:41.853 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
various Earth energies
otherwise too subtle to detect.

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:46.858 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
The team tested this theory
using simple dowsing rods

00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:50.662 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
made with coat hangers.
The results were compelling.

00:38:52.397 --> 00:38:57.135 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Your spine's right on it?
&gt;&gt;Yeah, my spine's right on it.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:58.703 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;People who have lain
on the cross

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:01.406 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
with their head at the north and
their feet at the south

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:05.276 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
have reported experiences
ranging from mystical visions

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.312 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
to miraculous healings.

00:39:07.312 --> 00:39:14.118 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Oh, my God! Oh, wow.

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:17.121 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Where'd you go?
&gt;&gt;It was some dimensional thing,

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:21.392 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
whatever.
I didn't know where I was,

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:24.395 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
I didn't have a clue.
[laughs]

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.831 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;It's called the healing cross.
I can't really comment,

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.301 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
as a geologist, whether
it has healing powers or not,

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:33.304 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
but what I do find interesting
is that when I

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:36.374 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
pull out my compass
and compare the coordinates of

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:38.376 align:start line:79% position:15% size:33%
the compass
to the cross,

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:42.981 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
this cross is very precisely
aligned north/south, east/west.

00:39:42.981 --> 00:39:45.250 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
So someone was really
paying attention to

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
what they were doing when they
were scraping this cross,

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.688 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
I would guess,
several hundred years ago.

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:55.026 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Peter explains what happened
to his friend, Carlos Secán,

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:57.595 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
after a debilitating
car accident left him

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
unable to walk.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.332 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
&gt;&gt;He couldn't move,
he was in traction.

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:04.936 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
And the doctors couldn't do
anything for him at all.

00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:06.904 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:35%
So in the end,

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:09.140 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
he asked his friends to carry
him up here on a stretcher.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.675 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And they literally carried him
all the way here,

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:13.244 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
and they left him
on this cross here.

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:15.513 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
And he was up here
for about 3 months,

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.148 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
for 3 months
he didn't come down.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:21.386 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
When he came down,
he came down walking.

00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:26.324 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Perhaps one of the most
bizarre images Ruzo identified

00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:29.761 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
on Markawasi is the one
he placed on the cover of

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:36.534 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
his book, a pair of figures he
calls 'the astronauts'.

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:39.003 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Well, we're going
to have to use our imagination

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.705 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
a little bit here, Dr. Schoch.
&gt;&gt;OK.

00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:44.809 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;When Ruzo, right at this very
spot, this very spot where we're

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:50.214 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
sitting right at the moment, he
saw two extraordinary beings.

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
They could be called astronauts.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.485 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Astronauts?
&gt;&gt;Astronauts from the future.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.621 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Wow.
&gt;&gt;And if you look carefully,

00:40:56.621 --> 00:41:00.124 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
you will see two beings
lying against a large rock

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:02.193 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
on the left hand side.
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:03.628 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
The further one away, you see

00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:08.366 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
a very large helmet, a man
wearing a helmet, shall I say.

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:12.236 align:start line:74% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Right. The large body -- one
single piece of rock,

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.872 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
one huge large body
wearing an astronaut suit.

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:16.641 align:start line:79% position:17% size:41%
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.
&gt;&gt;And then these

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:19.010 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
two legs below there,
a different shade.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.780 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Coming forward a little bit
on the left hand side, you see

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.149 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
another astronaut facing the
same direction, they're both

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.352 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
facing towards us here.
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:30.154 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;He has a
more complex structure.

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:33.291 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
He has his arms,
he has a very large helmet,

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.227 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and he has a head on top,
and he's looking towards us,

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:39.764 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
and there they are --
the two astronauts.

00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:41.466 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
&gt;&gt;Yeah, it's like

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the old is looking that way,
the new is looking this way

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.902 align:start line:79% position:15% size:33%
in this case.
&gt;&gt;Ah, yes.

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.904 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;They're facing each other.
That's extraordinary.

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.740 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
I mean, that hippo,

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:53.478 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
that seems to be from
ancient Egyptian times,

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
or at least it looks like
that type of motif.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.749 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Astronauts are completely
incompatible with that.

00:41:57.749 --> 00:42:01.018 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean, we're talking thousands
of years difference.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:04.622 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean,
I don't understand this at all.

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:08.226 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;The ancient and the modern.
&gt;&gt;The ancient and the modern.

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:12.296 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
But, if these are ancient
sculptures, how can we have

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:16.267 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the ancient and the modern?
If they're ancient sculptures,

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.636 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
do you think that
we've got things from Egypt

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:23.141 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
when we're sitting in Peru
at close to 13,000 feet?

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:24.675 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
That's incredible enough.

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:29.414 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
But to now tell me that
we're seeing astronauts here,

00:42:29.414 --> 00:42:31.849 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
that's like beyond belief.

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:34.285 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
&gt;&gt;Beyond belief.

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:39.357 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Now, where are we sitting
here? [laughs] It seems like

00:42:39.357 --> 00:42:42.093 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
this is a very comfortable place
to just sit.

00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:45.396 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;Yes, yes. Definitely.
The ancient builders

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:49.300 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
of this place took into
consideration that people

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.469 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
wanted to look at
their works of art.

00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:53.771 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And they put these little seats
all over the place so they could

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.873 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
sit comfortably.
&gt;&gt;So they could sit comfortably

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:57.809 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
and enjoy the view.
&gt;&gt;I like that.

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:01.479 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;All the figures here on the
Markawasi Plateau are either

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:04.615 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
facing out of the valley,
or they're facing directly

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:07.452 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
towards you,
or to left or to the right.

00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:10.288 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But right here where we are,
we have the most extraordinary

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:13.558 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
figure facing
up towards the sky.

00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:15.726 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Oh, looking straight up?
&gt;&gt;Looking straight up, yeah.

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:19.130 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
You see a huge head, in fact you
see the whole body starting with

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.300 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
the head on the left hand side 
with an open eye,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.136 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
a prominent nose, closed mouth

00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:27.438 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
with the lips closed.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Then we have a chin there
coming up after the mouth,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.777 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
and then we have kind of like
a small neck, very short neck,

00:43:32.777 --> 00:43:34.779 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
and then the whole body
which stretches out

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:37.348 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
to the right hand side
to where his feet would be.

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:39.684 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
And he could have
what we call a headdress.

00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:41.419 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
It looks like...
some people say they look

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:44.322 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
at this figure as he's wearing
some kind of a headdress.

00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:46.657 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Oh, on the very left there?
&gt;&gt;Yeah, well, where his head is,

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:50.261 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
there's something on his head.
&gt;&gt;Right, I see what you mean.

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.498 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Not necessarily the hair.
But looking straight up.

00:43:53.498 --> 00:43:58.002 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, some people say this figure
is similar to the figure,

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:00.304 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
the face on Mars.

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.639 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Oh, the face of Mars
from the Cydonia region on Mars.

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:03.307 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
&gt;&gt;That's right.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.543 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Because that face is also
looking up towards the sky.

00:44:05.543 --> 00:44:08.212 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
And this is the only figure,
one of the very few figures

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:11.282 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
here at Markawasi which look
straight up toward the sky.

00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:13.584 align:middle line:85% position:12% size:16%
&gt;&gt;Wow.

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:20.525 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;The ability to see figures and
faces in nature has fascinated

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:24.662 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
artists and mystics
from the earliest times.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.298 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Familiar images,
like the presidential faces

00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:30.201 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
which adorn Mt. Rushmore
in South Dakota

00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:33.404 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
are clearly manmade.

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:37.341 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But the source of images like
the Old Man of the Mountain in

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:40.645 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
New Hampshire are less obvious.

00:44:40.645 --> 00:44:42.914 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Figures like these have been
detected in cliffs and

00:44:42.914 --> 00:44:47.285 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
promontories all over the world,
yet their genesis is often

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.754 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
a complete mystery.

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:52.590 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
One explanation for these
impressions in nature,

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.260 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
found in such abundance at
Markawasi, is the interplay

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.964 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
between the human mind
and nature itself.

00:44:59.964 --> 00:45:03.334 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
This phenomenon is known as
simulacrum.

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:07.071 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
According to Cambridge scholar
John Michell, we are programmed

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:10.374 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
at birth to recognize
the human face.

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:13.578 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
In fact, a child's first drawing
is often a human face,

00:45:13.578 --> 00:45:16.747 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and as we continue through life
we see our own image,

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:22.653 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and animal images, reflected
in the world around us.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:28.593 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He claims this is a natural
function of human consciousness.

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:31.128 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
Furthermore, he believes
there is a corresponding

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:34.632 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
tendency in nature
to manifest repeatedly certain

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:39.236 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
basic designs, including
human and animal forms.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.906 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
In other words,
people are hardwired

00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:45.443 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
to see human and animal images
in nature, and nature is

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:49.614 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
predisposed to repeat certain
basic forms and designs,

00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:52.016 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
of which we are one.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:55.419 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Taking it one step further,
Michell has found many examples

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:59.056 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
of simulacra where
the image seems to embody

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:02.226 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
the spirit of the
surrounding landscape.

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:05.129 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
The Romans referred to this
as the genius loci, or

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:08.532 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
spirit of the place.

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:11.335 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
This image from Armenia
is said to represent

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.771 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
the martyr, Saint Vardan,
who was killed in battle

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:48%
near this location.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:19.343 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The delicate features of this
Welch maiden were found in the

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:23.681 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
mountains of North Wales near
the quaint town of Beddgelert.

00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:30.388 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Could the Monument of Humanity
be the genius loci of Markawasi?

00:46:30.388 --> 00:46:33.891 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Could the entire Markawasi
Plateau be the genius loci

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:37.628 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
of the human race?

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.797 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Some believe that the statues
on Markawasi

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:42.533 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
were made by the hand of man.

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:45.636 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Inside his head, we have a
big, large, beady eye...

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.707 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Others feel that they are the
product of nature itself,

00:46:49.707 --> 00:46:53.577 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
interpreted by the human mind.
Another possibility

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:58.849 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
is suggested by Javier Ruzo,
the grandson of Daniel Ruzo.

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:01.852 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
He explains how nature may have
provided the basic form,

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:05.389 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and that man later modified it.

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:09.193 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The artists that made Markawasi
wanted to finish the work

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:11.295 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
that nature began.

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.998 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Finishing the work of nature
does not mean to re-do it,

00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:17.835 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
nor does it mean to sculpt all
the stones. They only needed to

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.503 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
give some fundamental touches,

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:22.306 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
like with
The Monument to Humanity.

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:26.243 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
It is so big that you
only have to touch it a bit

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.913 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
to represent what it is.

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:31.582 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
It would be wrong to say

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:34.051 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
that all of the stones
have been sculpted.

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:36.754 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
There are many that
are simply natural.

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:39.724 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But that is what is so special
about Markawasi.

00:47:39.724 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
It's a mountain that is
full of natural figures

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.162 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
that have special shapes.

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:49.700 align:start line:79% position:17% size:43%
That is sacred.
It's truly magic.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.504 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Javier Ruzo is an artist
living in Lima, Peru.

00:47:53.504 --> 00:47:57.241 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
He carries on the traditions
of his grandfather

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.177 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
by incorporating themes of
mythology and symbolism

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:28%
in his art.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.683 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
&gt;&gt;When I was 16,

00:48:05.683 --> 00:48:09.787 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I went to Markawasi for the
first time with my grandfather.

00:48:09.787 --> 00:48:12.723 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He taught me to recognize
mythology and the symbols there.

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:16.627 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So, working with my grandfather,
I learned to see the

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:20.131 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
universal symbols which
represent the inner man,

00:48:20.131 --> 00:48:24.068 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
such as solar symbols,
which I use in my art today.

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:26.904 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
I am looking not
for what is current,

00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
but what is eternal
for the human being.

00:48:32.343 --> 00:48:35.045 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Symbolism is everlasting,
and Markawasi is

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:38.182 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
a great book of symbols.

00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:40.317 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
When you walk there at night,
you feel you are

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:42.653 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
surrounded by a mystery.

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.222 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Shapes that can take you
to your unconscious mind,

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:48.259 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
or can take you to the legends,
or it can take you to

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:52.730 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
the scenes
of a millennial theater.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.933 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;One of Daniel Ruzo's greatest
contributions to the study of

00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:58.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Markawasi was to map the precise

00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:02.673 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
viewing spots, and record the
exact time and date when the

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.476 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
statues are most clearly seen.

00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:10.815 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
As a result, he coined the term
'point of view statues'.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:18.088 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;The explanation is very
difficult, because it depends

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:20.624 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
on the light and
the point of view.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:24.562 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
If the point of view changes,
everything changes.

00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:26.797 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
The twilight shadows or
The Moonlight Reveal

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:30.301 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
carved on the stones
countless interwoven figures

00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:33.437 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
that are invisible in daylight.

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:37.274 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
A mind tries to find a logical
argument to explain this,

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:40.578 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
but there is an air of suspense
that leaves our mind naked

00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:43.714 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
and transports our souls
to the past.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:48.953 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The notion of point of view is
well illustrated by this figure

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:53.691 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Ruzo called
The Fallen Horse and Rider.

00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:56.093 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;The locals call this figure

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:59.697 align:start line:79% position:17% size:43%
El Caballo Caída,
The Fallen Horse.

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:02.333 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And if you look carefully,
you see what looks like a

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.502 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
horse lying down on the ground.

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:08.439 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
You have its feet at the back,
you have its long body

00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:12.843 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
in like a U shape,
and then its head towards us.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:16.247 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Ok, so it's sort of facing us,
and to the left.

00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:17.715 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Yes, that's right.

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:21.185 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
So we have the horse
in a horse position, as if it

00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:23.420 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
was lying down on the ground.
&gt;&gt;Ok.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.023 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;We have a horse's head
with a large eye

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:29.226 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
about halfway up
on the right hand side.

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.828 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.
&gt;&gt;And his nostrils at the front.

00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:33.330 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
It's like... looks exhausted.
Looks absolutely exhausted.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.299 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Right!
&gt;&gt;Now, let's go back a bit,

00:50:35.299 --> 00:50:38.869 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
and we can find
behind the horse, a rider.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.905 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Do you mind if we move back for
a second, Dr. Schoch?

00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:43.140 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
And you'll see...

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.341 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Where am I going?
&gt;&gt;About here's good,

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:47.745 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
here is very good.
Dr. Ruzo reckons,

00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:52.049 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I think so as well, that the
figure behind the horse, on the

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:54.251 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
other side there, is the rider.

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:56.453 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
If you look from exactly this
point of view you see

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:58.689 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the rider riding on the horse.
&gt;&gt;Oh, I see, because

00:50:58.689 --> 00:51:02.226 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
there's this line
splitting the figure in half.

00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:05.062 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And right beyond that line
there's that structure.

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:07.298 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
That's the rider.

00:51:07.298 --> 00:51:11.468 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now if this is a horse that
we're seeing in this structure,

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:16.874 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I mean, that's very interesting
because horses did not come

00:51:16.874 --> 00:51:18.275 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
until the Spaniards.
&gt;&gt;That's right.

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:22.646 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The native Incans and Pre-Incans
before the Spaniards came,

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:25.115 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
they didn't know about horses.
&gt;&gt;They had no idea.

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.317 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
In fact,
they were frightened

00:51:26.317 --> 00:51:27.818 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
by the horses when
they first came here.

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:29.553 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:38%
&gt;&gt;Right, right.

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:30.554 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;The horses didn't arrive here
until the sixteenth century.

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:32.056 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
Where did the horses
originally...

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:34.258 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;Oh, yeah.
They came from the Arabs

00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:35.726 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and from Europe, of course,
and then the Spaniards

00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:37.828 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
brought them over here.

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.763 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Right, because here at
Markawasi, one of the strange

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
things is, is that you always
have to be in the right spot.

00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:43.133 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;Mm hm.
&gt;&gt;Which means not only

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.836 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
standing in the right spot,
the right time of day,

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:48.639 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
even the right time of year.
Because if you came here,

00:51:48.639 --> 00:51:51.108 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
for example,
in December or January, you

00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:52.943 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
wouldn't see anything at all.
&gt;&gt;Wouldn't see anything at all?

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.445 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Wouldn't see anything at all.

00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:55.412 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
&gt;&gt;That's interesting.
That's interesting.

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Now this is, as I understand it,

00:51:57.748 --> 00:51:59.083 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
this is a theory developed by

00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:01.819 align:middle line:79% position:27% size:63%
Daniel Ruzo, Dr. Ruzo...?

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:04.555 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Dr Ruzo discovered Markawasi
in 1952. He spent 8 years

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:08.225 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
examining the statues, and this
is one of his favorites here.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.994 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Oh, really?
&gt;&gt;One of his absolute favorites.

00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:11.295 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;Oh, wow. That's very neat.

00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.664 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
&gt;&gt;We are following in
the master's footsteps.

00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:15.332 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:25%
&gt;&gt;[laughs]

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:19.470 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Now if we keep walking...
Ok, so now if we keep walking,

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.905 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
because I want to observe this.
We keep walking, now it goes out

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:24.408 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
of view again. Well, the horse
is still there. The horse is

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:29.313 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
still there, but the rider is
sort of offset and disappearing.

00:52:31.782 --> 00:52:34.985 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;From this simple ledge
the condors are seen.

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:46.196 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:3%
 

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:47.631 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
In addition to the many spots

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:50.801 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
which afford an ideal
point of view when standing,

00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:53.303 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
some of the more prominent
statues are best seen from

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:57.408 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
so-called 'viewing seats',
a comfortable depression

00:52:57.408 --> 00:53:00.344 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
or a bench in the landscape
that Ruzo claimed was

00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:04.114 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
directly aligned with the figure
you're intended to see.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.649 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
&gt;&gt;Yeah, it looks like...

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.951 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
what I'm sitting on,
it looks like a chair.

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:12.256 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
It sure enough looks like
a seat or a chair to sit here

00:53:12.256 --> 00:53:15.125 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
and view this structure.

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.728 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
I mean, it's absolutely
fascinating. This is

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:22.999 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
totally covered with the organic
lichens and other forms.

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.969 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
Very, very ancient surfaces.

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:30.841 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So this has been, clearly,
like this for a long, long time.

00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:37.881 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
And they maybe cut that out
in millennia gone past

00:53:37.881 --> 00:53:40.317 align:start line:79% position:19% size:48%
so that we could
sit down with this,

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.753 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
or did it just
fold out like that naturally?

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:45.622 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
But when I'm sitting here I have
this beautiful vantage point

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
of what... I mean,
you can view the camel a

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.863 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
nd then the valley beyond
and the mountains beyond that.

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.534 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;One of Peter's cameramen while
looking for a good vantage point

00:53:57.534 --> 00:54:01.805 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to film a figure on the edge of
a cliff found the ideal spot.

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:06.810 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
nd noticed the smoothed-out seat
directly behind his tripod.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.681 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Making use of this comfortable
vantage point, he filmed a

00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:15.652 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
sequence of this intriguing rock
formation known as The Pharaoh.

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:20.524 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
For Ruzo, point of view
meant not only the place

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:23.360 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
where you stand,
but also the time of day,

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.864 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
and even the time of year
when you see it.

00:54:26.864 --> 00:54:29.433 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
He noticed that most of the
figures are best seen

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:32.703 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
at the end of June,
around the summer solstice.

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:36.340 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
To test his hypothesis,
the film crew chose a figure

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.943 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
known as The Mexican Lion,
and did a five hour time lapse

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:45.582 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
sequence from 12 pm to 5 pm.

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:48.719 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
At noon, when the sun is
directly overhead, the lion's

00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:52.322 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
features were indistinct.

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.558 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
But as the sun crept west
and began to set,

00:54:54.558 --> 00:54:57.728 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
the shadows deepened,
creating what some felt

00:54:57.728 --> 00:55:03.400 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
was the face of a lion.

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:08.172 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Nobody can go to Markawasi and
be the same when you come back.

00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:12.442 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
Somehow the stones affect you.

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:14.845 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
They get into your mind,
they get into your brain,

00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
they come into your dreams.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.284 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And when you come back,
you're a different person.

00:55:20.284 --> 00:55:22.452 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
&gt;&gt;As Daniel Ruzo said,

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:28.258 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
the faces change or come alive
at different times of the year,

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:31.628 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
as the light hits them
at different angles.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:35.899 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I know it might sound a bit
corny, but for me it's become

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.634 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
a real metaphor for life.

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:41.004 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
If you see something
from one perspective,

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:44.308 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
or as Daniel Ruzo said,
point of view,

00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:48.412 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and then you see it from another
point of view, things change.

00:55:48.412 --> 00:55:52.683 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And so the enigma of Markawasi
for me is that simple,

00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:56.420 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
but that from one point of view
something looks very clear,

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.223 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and from another point of view
at a different time of the year

00:55:59.223 --> 00:56:01.792 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
it can look different.

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:06.763 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
&gt;&gt;The ancients had knowledge
that was passed

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:08.899 align:start line:79% position:17% size:43%
from hand to hand
like a jewel

00:56:08.899 --> 00:56:10.834 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that had to be transmitted
to the future,

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:13.971 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
because they knew that there
would be a flood that would

00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:16.773 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
obliterate this information.

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:20.143 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
So Markawasi is another sacred
mountain like the pyramids.

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:23.714 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
It is a pyramid made
of a mountain.

00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:26.149 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And they both store information
about the past times

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that we are just beginning
to understand.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.358 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;As a geologist I have to say,
over the years I have come

00:56:34.358 --> 00:56:38.128 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to even hate... I really hate
the distinction, in some cases,

00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:42.332 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
between natural and artificial,
human and otherwise.

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:44.368 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
Because we are part of nature.

00:56:44.368 --> 00:56:48.505 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So, yeah, if you want to put
them into the little pigeonhole

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.807 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
categories of
natural versus artificial,

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.809 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
Yes, they are natural.

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:55.279 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
But does that detract from them?
I don't think so.

00:56:55.279 --> 00:56:57.714 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
I don't really even think
that's a question now.

00:56:57.714 --> 00:57:00.951 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Yes, I came up here saying,
"Oh, I've got to figure it out.

00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:02.719 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
Are they artificial?
Are they natural?

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:05.222 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
It has to be one or the other.
We need to know."

00:57:05.222 --> 00:57:07.591 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
I'm now going away thinking

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:09.259 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
"That's not even
an important issue."

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.827 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
"That's not even
an important question."

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.297 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
What's really important is
"How do they affect us?"

00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
How are we transformed,
effectively, by coming up here

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.170 align:start line:79% position:18% size:45%
and spending time
in their presence?

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.411 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Daniel Ruzo passed away,
and his friends and relatives

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:31.782 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
returned him once more
to the plateau that he loved.

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:36.486 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
In a ceremony timeless in its
simplicity, his ashes were flung

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:40.724 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
into the air, so that his spirit
would unite for all time with

00:57:40.724 --> 00:57:45.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the wondrous forms of Markawasi.

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:48.999 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
The mystery of Markawasi
continues, but the meaning of

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:51.601 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
Markawasi is perhaps
best expressed

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:55.339 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
in Daniel Ruzo's words.

00:57:55.339 --> 00:57:58.842 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
&gt;&gt;"They wanted to express
themselves as a group.

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:02.145 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
They wanted to perpetuate
their common desires.

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:06.550 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
They wanted to make us aware
of their existence,

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:11.321 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
to remind us of their unity
in a human ideal."

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:17.761 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Markawasi, 12,000 feet above
the sea. Markawasi, which towers

00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:22.032 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
above the Pacific, and which
awakes in the souls of her

00:58:22.032 --> 00:58:27.671 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
visitors the most profound of
human emotions.
