00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.908 align:middle line:90%
Years ago, I had an experience.

00:00:47.908 --> 00:00:49.812 align:middle line:90%
An experience of light.

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
My whole body was
filled with light.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I felt connected by that
light to the universe.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I became conscious an
exquisite radiance permeating

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of all life.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.631 align:middle line:84%
I saw that every living thing
has its own special luminous

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
quality.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:40.194 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt a yearning
to understand it.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I realized from my experience
that the source of that light

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.275 align:middle line:84%
is reborn in every
moment of creation.

00:01:55.275 --> 00:02:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to see that
everyday light is just

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the visible aspect of
that infinite light,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
which in reality isn't out
there someplace, but right here.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.252 align:middle line:84%
We begin this journey
with the familiar world.

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:29.481 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:90%
The world around us.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
of light and shadow.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Light has many faces.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Fire.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:90%
A primal force.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:90%
A universal symbol of energy.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%

in every religion.

They say the rays of
knowledge rose like a light

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
above his head and around him.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.867 align:middle line:84%
The light of Christ begins
with the Annunciation.

00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.896 align:middle line:84%
Those whose lives were touched
by his shared his radiance.

Ancient Indian scriptures
say that we could

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.605 align:middle line:84%
become as gods, with the visible

were observed, revealing

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:12.665 align:middle line:90%

communicating
directly with humans.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.495 align:middle line:84%
Each ray extending a hand to
accept offerings and give life.

00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.735 align:middle line:84%
The sun, a fiery
sphere of light.

00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:90%
A mandala.

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
A mandala is a sunlike
form, a symbol of wholeness,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
a way of understanding
and experiencing

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.695 align:middle line:90%
different levels of reality.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Like the sun radiating
from a center

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:90%
its design ignites inner light.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there's a sea of
electricity in the human body.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%

metaphor, but an actual energy.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
While one part carries
a message of new birth,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
others complete their cycles.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.852 align:middle line:84%
And life is embraced by
the darkness of death.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Ancient texts to speak of
light in the afterlife.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:84%
From the "Book of the Dead"--
"Do not forget this secret.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
When your mind
and body separate,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
primary clear light."

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like a mirage--
subtle, but bright.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Do not be afraid.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.313 align:middle line:84%
It is the same light
you also radiate.

00:15:09.313 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.486 align:middle line:90%
Is there light after death?

00:15:15.486 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Similar reports come from
people who've returned to life

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:90%
after being pronounced dead.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Going down a tunnel
with a light at the end.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
At first, the light is dim,
growing gradually brighter.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And with it, a feeling of
great love and the infinite.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
To understand the intention
of physical matter.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes and yes and yes
again, cries out my heart.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.834 align:middle line:90%
Today, I touch the Earth.

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:16.948 align:middle line:84%
And willing and loving, she
then touches me in return.

00:18:16.948 --> 00:18:19.912 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great mother, guide me.

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Show me that pressing, lifting,
blinding light of love.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.208 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:30.522 align:middle line:90%
Born in eternity.

00:18:30.522 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And living in all that is.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
All that is, walk with me now.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.992 align:middle line:90%
Clear my mind.

00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:47.331 align:middle line:90%
Clear my eyes.

00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Clear this, my body, that
I might receive you fully.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And let me become
a giver of light.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:90%
