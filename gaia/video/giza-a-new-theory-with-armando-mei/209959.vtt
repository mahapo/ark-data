>> My name is Armando Mei, and I
am an investigative journalist,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:10%
self-trained
Egyptologist, and author.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:10%
I will read to you a new theory
on the origins of the pyramids

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.292 align:middle line:10%
of Giza, or what
Egyptologists call Zep Tepi,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:10%
the creation of ancient Egypt.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:10%
Until now, all researchers
focused their study

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:10%
on the Great Pyramid
or the Sphinx,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:10%
sometimes on the second
pyramid, the Chephren Pyramid,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:10%
never on the third pyramid,
the Mycerinus Pyramid.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:10%
The Giza Plateau has never
been studied as a whole,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:10%
considering the possible
existence of other monuments

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:10%
that were built at the same time
as the pyramids and the Sphinx.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have consistently
rejected the assumption.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:10%
But as we'll see that
new points of view

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:10%
is the key to understanding one
of the mysteries of the past,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:10%
and it opens the way to
material of the primary planning

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:10%
of Giza.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:10%
At the end of
'90s, Robert Bauval

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:10%
published "Keeper of Genesis,"
co-authored by Graham Hancock.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:10%
The book has been
so important to me

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:10%
because it prompted me
to initiate my research

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:10%
There is a question in
the book that struck me.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:10%
In one of the last
chapters, Hancock

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:10%
asked Robert, why do you have
the alignment between pyramids

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:10%
and stars dated at
10,500 before Christ,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:10%
and not a previous processional
time, such as 36,000 or 62,000

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:10%
before Christ?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Bauval answered very carefully,
because dating could affect

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:10%
the phases of human evolution.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:10%
I can understand why
Bauval gave that answer.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:10%
It was a very trying time for
him, being accused of heresy

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:10%
by Egyptologists.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:10%
However, Hancock's
question is fascinating.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:10%
His inquiry opened
my mind as I tried

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:10%
to join all clues
concerning the myth

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:10%
and papyrus, gods and kings
lists, lost civilizations

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:10%
and pyramids.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:10%
Everything was going to be
joined by that question.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:10%
My mind was flowing
towards new patterns,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:10%
and I understood that the
key was written in the stars.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:10%
They were waiting to
be read correctly.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:10%
Then another important
event took place in 2012.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:10%
I received an email from John
Ward, an English Egyptologist,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:10%
who discovered a very
interesting tomb.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:10%
At the end of the
email, he asked

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:10%
my opinion concerning
the so-called mastaba

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:10%
of Queen Khentkaus.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:10%
I have to say that it caught
me by surprise because I have

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:10%
never heard about that unknown
monument positioned southeast

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:10%
So I studied the monument,
acquiring lots of information,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:10%
and then I went to Egypt to
research its possible purpose.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:10%
After a challenging
investigation,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:10%
I discovered one of
the forgotten pieces

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:10%
of the primary planning of Giza.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:10%
Let's go in order.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:10%
The Khentkaus mastaba is
a fascinating monument

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:10%
with very particular shapes.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:10%
Before introducing
the analysis, I

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:10%
believe it's crucial
to understand

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:10%
who queen Khentkaus was
and when she took part

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:10%
in Egyptian history.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:10%
She was Mycerinus' daughter
and mother of the first three

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:10%
pharaohs of the Fifth
Dynasty, and she

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:10%
wanted her last abode
built on a ridge southeast

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:10%
We don't know why
she chose this,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:10%
but we can discern
some interesting clues

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:10%
through some investigation.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:10%
Two types of construction
stages characterized her tomb.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:10%
The lower part is
somewhat mysterious,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:10%
but Egyptians clearly built the
top during the Dynastic age.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:10%
The lower part is very
intriguing because

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:10%
of its shape.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's investigate the
mystery of the lower part.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:10%
First, from east to
west, the lower part

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:10%
is carved in the rock
and looks like a spiral.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:10%
Second, we know the spiral
is hermetically connected

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:10%
to the Great Mother's myth,
symbolizing fertility, growth,

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:10%
plenty.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Third, Khentkaus'
name means "who

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:10%
rules on the spirits," which
is the same function of Isis

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:10%
as Osiris' wife and
the afterlife goddess.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:10%
Fourth, the spiral carved at
the base of Khentkaus' mastaba

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:10%
results in a design that looks
like the star Sirius' orbit.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:10%
Fifth, if we observe the
west side of the ridge,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:10%
we see evidence of
water erosion that

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:10%
is very similar to
the Sphinx erosion.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:10%
We have some
evidence reminding us

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:10%
of the goddess who the
Egyptians worshiped.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, we can
assume that the lower carved

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:10%
part of the mastaba is the
same age as the Sphinx because

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:10%
of the same water
erosion presence.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:10%
But that is just the beginning.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:10%
I put my clues together.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:10%
But before coming
to any conclusion.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:10%
I needed to explore the sky
above Giza during the Zep Tepi.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:10%
It was clear that Bauval's
proposal didn't work,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:10%
so I shifted the
sky back in time

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.105 align:middle line:10%
to the preceding
processional cycle.

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:10%
In the following table, we
can see the sky above Giza

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:10%
in 36,400 before Christ.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:10%
At the vernal equinox dawn,
an entire processional cycle

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:10%
before 10,500 before
Christ, the monuments

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:10%
were perfectly aligned with
the constellations as follows.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:10%
First, at east, the
earliest sunshine rays

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:10%
disclosed the dawn.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:10%
Second, lion
constellation and Sphinx

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:10%
are closely connected to the
east, as in Bauval's theory.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:10%
Third, this is the
key to my theory.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:10%
The Orion constellation is
on the celestial meridian,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:10%
precisely above the pyramids.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:10%
But the difference is a perfect
connection between Alnitak,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:10%
the large star of
the Orion's belt,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:10%
and the Great Pyramid, the
biggest monument on the Giza

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:10%
Plateau.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:10%
As Alnitak lies on the
celestial meridian,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid lies in the
center of the emerged lands,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:10%
or rather at the main meridian
and parallel intersection,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:10%
or rather at the distance
of 1/3 between the equator

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:10%
and the North Pole, symbolizing
the natural zero for longitude.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:10%
Fourth, the correlation
between monuments and stars

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:10%
occurred only in that
astronomical configuration,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:10%
and in no one astronomical
alignment from the present time

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:10%
to 100,000 before Christ.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:10%
What is amazing is
the presence of Sirius

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:10%
in the sky at the
southeast, near the Orion

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:10%
constellation and visible from
Giza, because the star lies

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:10%
above the celestial horizon.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Its appearance in the sky
suggests a possible correlation

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:10%
with a monument southeast
of the pyramids.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:10%
Moreover, many
astronomical guidelines

00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:10%
prove the concept of
the new age beginning.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the Moon, it
is in the new moon period,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:10%
having just a few minutes of the
new lunar phase, its position

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:10%
at slightly below the
celestial horizon,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:10%
ready to follow the sun
across the ecliptic.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:10%
Then let's observe
the planets' position.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:10%
They are positioned along
the ecliptic in precise order

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:10%
in the southeast hemisphere.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:10%
Symbolically, they are
waiting for the rising sun

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:10%
as it moves along the ecliptic.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:10%
Moreover, in ancient
times, only the planets

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:10%
that were associated with the
days of the week were present.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:10%
It is very intriguing
to note that the planet

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:10%
of the rest, Saturn, is located
precisely in the southwest

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:10%
quadrant, the so-called
place of death

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:10%
for the ancient Egyptians.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Its disposition is fascinating.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:10%
Because of certain
Hebrew traditions,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:10%
they consider Saturday,
the day of rest,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to
celebrating the Lord.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:10%
Does it mean that
Zep Tepi memories

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:10%
influence Hebrew traditions?

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.765 align:middle line:10%
I think it is a topic to be
analyzed as soon as possible.

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:10%
Let's return to the primary
topic, the mysteries

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:10%
of Khentkaus' tomb.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:10%
The question is, could it be
as ancient as the pyramids?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:10%
And if yes, what
proof do we have?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the answer
was impressed somewhere

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient text.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:10%
After many months
dedicated to research,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:10%
I found some clues in
the Inventory Stela.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:10%
As for the kings
list, Egyptologists

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:10%
considered the Inventory
Stela a very dubious document.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:10%
The French Egyptologist,
Auguste Mariette,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:10%
found it in the middle
of 19th century.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:10%
The Stela is dated back
to the 26th Dynasty.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:10%
As I said, archaeologists
consider it unreliable

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:10%
because it refers to
controversial events

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:10%
during the Cheops Kingdom.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:10%
Notably, the inscription
compiled 1,500 years

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:10%
after Cheops' death
says that when

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:10%
he took the throne, the
pyramids and the Sphinx

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:10%
were already built. So I
decided to study the document

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:10%
and I noted that its
original translation seems

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:10%
to be incorrect.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:10%
Some basic mistakes
change the actual message.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:10%
That's why I believe it could
be vital in shedding light

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:10%
on the Giza mystery.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:10%
Let's read the inscription
according to Egyptologists.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:10%
Cheops found the house of
Isis, ruling of the pyramid,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:10%
was near the house
of the Sphinx,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:10%
above between the north
and west of the house.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we see the
hieroglyphic circle,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
it has been
translated just once,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:90%
meanwhile it is inscribed twice.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:10%
It means "near" or "beside."

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:10%
Then if we consider the original
translation is incorrect,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:10%
and the correct
translation is, he, Cheops,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:10%
found the house of Isis
was near the pyramid

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:10%
and beside the
house of the Sphinx,

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:10%
above between the north
and west of the house,"

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:10%
from the translation we
have two conclusions.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:10%
First, the house of Isis
was between the pyramids

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:10%
and the Sphinx.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Second, its
geographical position

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:10%
is from the north to the
west, through the Sphinx.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:10%
What monument corresponds
with that information?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:10%
As we can appreciate
from the image,

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.085 align:middle line:10%
it is the carved ridge on which
Khentkaus built her mastaba.

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:10%
From the position
of the monuments,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:10%
while the pyramids
are perfectly aligned

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:10%
with geographical points and
corresponding to Orion's belt,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:10%
and the Sphinx aligns to
the east and corresponding

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:10%
to the lion
constellation, the mastaba

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:10%
seems to have a
different alignment.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:10%
If we observe the blue line,
the monument's disposition

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:10%
seems to move towards
the southwest.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:10%
Is there a ratio?

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:10%
The answer is yes.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:10%
Suppose we join
with two red lines

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:10%
the northwest angles cited
in the Inventory Stela

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:10%
throughout the mastaba
center and the west side.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:10%
In that case, we obtain a design
that looks like the Canis Major

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:10%
constellation, having the
star Sirius as its vertex.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:10%
It could be considered an effort
to inscribe that constellation

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:10%
on Giza, explaining why
they built the mastaba

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:10%
with a different
geographical position

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:10%
than the other monuments.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:10%
But other clues suggest
the possible correlation

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:10%
between the lower part of the
mastaba and the Sirius star.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:10%
If we observe the
astronomical map at 36,400

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:10%
before Christ, to
the naked eye, Sirius

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:10%
is very close to the Orion
constellation and far away

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:10%
from the Lion constellation.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:10%
So if the mastaba is the
image of Sirius on Earth,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:10%
it must be closer to the
pyramids and farthest

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:10%
from the Sphinx.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:10%
The image suggests that the
distance among monuments

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:10%
are wrong because
the mastaba is closer

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:10%
to the Sphinx and farthest
from the pyramids.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Did the builders make a mistake?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.405 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely not.

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:10%
The image shows that
the position is correct

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:10%
because Sirius is
closer to Regulus

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:10%
in light years in the
Lion constellation,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:10%
and further than Orion.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:10%
Is it a coincidence?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, it
means that the builders

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:10%
had the perfect
knowledge of science,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and particularly of astronomy.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:10%
They knew about astronomical
distances between stars,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:10%
constellations, and planets.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:10%
But that's not all.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:10%
If we observe the
geographical position

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:10%
of the mastaba on
the Giza Plateau,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:10%
we can see that
it has an angular

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:10%
position of 67.39 degrees
than the east, more or less.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the alignment
at 36,400 before Christ,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:10%
the Sirius angular separation
from east is 67.58 degrees.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing confirmation of
their knowledge of astronomy,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:10%
and at the same
time, it is proof

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:10%
that the monument is an
ancient piece of the Giza

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:10%
primary planning.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:10%
And very probably, where
the Khentkaus mastaba

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:10%
was tens of thousands
of years ago,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:10%
there was a building
positioned similarly called

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:10%
Isis' House, which has
since been destroyed,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:10%
as the Inventory Stela tells.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:10%
Lastly, the builders
were so precise they

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:10%
joined the monument to
geographical and astronomical

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:10%
points.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:10%
What information could
emerge from the dimensions

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:10%
of the lower part
of the mastaba?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:10%
Could there be a possible
mathematical relationship

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:10%
with the star Sirius?

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:10%
I analyzed some comparable
parameters in royal qubits

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:10%
for a homogeneous relationship,
and the results are as follows.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:10%
The first column shows
the mastaba parameters

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:10%
and the third comparable
parameters of Sirius star.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:10%
The second and fourth columns
show data in royal qubits.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:10%
The fifth column shows
the mathematical ratio

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:10%
as the base of
relationship data.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:10%
The last column shows
the mathematic constants

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:10%
as the base of the
mastaba projects.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:10%
It means that the
builders already

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:10%
knew Sirius' physical
characteristics and dimensions.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:10%
So applying the mathematical
constant, pi, and phi,

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:10%
the universal constant,
one could apply everywhere

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:10%
in the universe they processed
an architectural model

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:10%
to build the monument,
giving it proportionally

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:10%
the exact dimensions
of the star.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:10%
This is the first mystery
I will try to unveil

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:10%
in the southeast of Giza.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:10%
There are also other
well-preserved mysteries

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:10%
to unveil on the east side
of the pyramids, where they

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.345 align:middle line:10%
built temples and the Sphinx.

00:18:17.345 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:10%
In 2014, I was engaged in an
archaeological campaign in Giza

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:10%
exploring the pyramids'
northwest area.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:10%
At the end of the
job, I spent two days

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:10%
visiting the temples
near the Sphinx

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:10%
because I was fascinated by the
buildings with large limestone

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:10%
blocks.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:10%
When you visit the
Sphinx area, you

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:10%
can feel that it
is a microcosm very

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:10%
different from the
pyramids, as it

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:10%
is composed of three
buildings-- the Sphinx

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Temple, the Temple
of the Valley,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:10%
and the Amenhotep II's Temple.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:10%
It is a world with its own
characteristics and messages

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:10%
to decode.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx is impressive
and the temples are as well.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:10%
They are positioned
symmetrically,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:10%
and they seem to be
similar in size and shape.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:10%
Egyptologists claim that
Khafre's workers built

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:10%
the so-called Sphinx
temples after building

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:10%
the second pyramid
and the Sphinx,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:10%
but I have many
doubts on that matter.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:10%
Instead, I believe the
temples and the Sphinx

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:10%
were built simultaneously
because of technical details

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
highlighting several symmetries,
similarities, and connections.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:10%
Egyptologists say
that the temple

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:10%
was built during Khafre's
reign because they

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:10%
found the statue in diorite
in a well in the temple.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:10%
However, this is the
only proof they have.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:10%
On the other side,
many clues suggest

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:10%
the temple is more ancient
than the Egyptian age.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:10%
For example, the Inventory
Stela tell us the pyramids

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:10%
and the Sphinx already existed
at the time of Cheops' reign.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:10%
As for the pyramids
and Khentkaus' mastaba,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:10%
the Valley Temple
lacks hieroglyphics

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:10%
celebrating the pharaoh
or deity of the time.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:10%
I investigated the
tables because I

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:10%
was intrigued by the
blocks forming them that

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:10%
are impressive for
their dimensions.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:10%
They remind me of the
blocks forming the pyramids,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:10%
and I believe they were
part of the same projects.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's have a quick
look at the monuments.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx Temple is
very ancient, more

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:10%
than Dynastic age.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.670 align:middle line:10%
It must be considered one of the
most ancient temples ever built

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt, perhaps in Earth.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Hundreds of limestone blocks
formed its basic structure.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:10%
What is impressive
is that each stone

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:10%
has an average weight of
200 tons, positioned one

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:10%
upon the other.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:10%
To have an idea
of this endeavor,

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:10%
we can make a comparison with
the famous archaeological site

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:10%
of Stonehenge in England.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:10%
Every monolith forming
the English site

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:10%
as an average
weight of a 50 tons,

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:10%
just a quarter of the
weight of the blocks

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:10%
used for the Sphinx
Temple in Egypt.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:10%
An in-depth
investigation suggests

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:10%
that the temple seems to be
built in two different stages

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:10%
because of the different type
of blocks the builders used.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:10%
At the beginning, the temple
was built with limestone blocks.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:10%
But during the Dynastic
age, Egyptian workers

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:10%
used granite blocks
for restoring

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:10%
the building, affected by
the wind and water erosion.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:10%
When observing the
blocks we can see

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:10%
that the granite was cut to fit
together with limestone blocks

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:10%
where they had strongly eroded,
an interesting detail that

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:10%
could confirm the
Inventory Stela contents

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:10%
and suggests that Cheops likely
had maintenance work done

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:10%
on this pyramid, but
he did not build it.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:10%
The second moment I visited
was the so-called Valley Temple

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:10%
that is very similar
to the Sphinx temple.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Built with limestone and then
restored with pink granite

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:10%
blocks, we don't know why,
but maintenance work was not

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:10%
completed and all of the blocks
have been seriously affected

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:10%
by the weather.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.340 align:middle line:10%
Lastly, I visited the unknown
Amenhotep II's Temple,

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.420 align:middle line:10%
built during the New Kingdom and
positioned on the little ridge

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:10%
northeast of the Sphinx.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:10%
It has almost collapsed.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:10%
Just a few elements
still stand--

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:10%
some columns, the entrance,
and the stairwell complex

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of the building.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:10%
Observing the temple, we can
see some details referring

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:10%
to the possible
existence of a preceding

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:10%
monument on which Amenhotep's
workers built the temple.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:10%
The floor, almost
destroyed, reveals

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:10%
pieces of an ancient basement
much older than the temple,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:10%
characterized by huge
blocks reminiscent of those

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:10%
forming the two temples
beneath the Sphinx.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:10%
All these details need
to be put in order

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:10%
to understand why east of Giza
all those monuments were built

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.825 align:middle line:10%
and what their purpose was.

00:23:57.825 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:10%
Once more, I found the answer
by observing the astronomical

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:10%
map at 36,400 before Christ.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:10%
It allowed me to fix
a perfect correlation

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:10%
between the pyramids
and Orion's belt,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:10%
between the Sphinx and
the Lion constellation,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:10%
and between Khentkaus' mastaba
and Sirius, as new factor

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:10%
not seen in Bauval's theory.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:10%
I believe it is an
excellent device

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:10%
to find out the truth
about the mysteries

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:10%
of the east side of Giza.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:10%
I used the same scientific
model for Khentkaus' mastaba,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:10%
which helped me discover
its correlation with Sirius.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:10%
Looking at the
astronomical map, I

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:10%
observed the presence
of two planets

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:10%
near Regulus, the greatest
star of the Lion constellation.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:10%
The two planets are
Mercury and Jupiter.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:10%
It was incredible to find
a possible correlation

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:10%
with the monuments.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:10%
It was a great clue, and
it was the first time

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:10%
that I was working on monuments
other than the pyramids

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:10%
or mastaba.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:10%
I had two temples
and two planets,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:10%
several data
points, and the need

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:10%
to bring new astronomical
data to check

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:10%
for possible
connections among them.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:10%
I knew that it would
be a stunning discovery

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:10%
if the results were correct.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the mathematical
constants pi and phi

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:10%
would play a key role, similar
to the Sirius-Khentkaus

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:10%
correlation.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:10%
In addition, I approached
the investigation

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:10%
using the same geometrical
and physical parameters

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:10%
I used for Khentkaus' mastaba.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:10%
I analyzed comparable
parameters,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:10%
having dimensions
in royal qubits

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:10%
for homogeneous comparison.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:10%
We have two tables
for each correlation.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Results are as follows.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:10%
The first column shows
the temple's parameters

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:10%
as the third for planets'
comparable parameters.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:10%
The second and fourth columns
showed that in royal qubits.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:10%
The fifth column shows
the mathematical ratio

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:10%
as base of data relationship.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:10%
The last column shows
the mathematic constants

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:10%
as base of the
temple's projects.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:10%
Results confirm the
doubts that builders

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:10%
sized the temple's
dimensions processing

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:10%
some primary
planets' parameters,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:10%
according to the
laws of mathematics,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:10%
based on the
application of the two

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:10%
main mathematical
constants, pi and phi.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.320 align:middle line:10%
The astronomical configuration
suggests a precise correlation

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:10%
between Jupiter and
Mercury with Regulus

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:10%
during the astronomical
time of the Zep Tepi,

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:10%
giving a kind of a microcosm
at the east of the pyramids

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:10%
involving the Sphinx
and temples as well.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:10%
Moreover, the results suggest
an elementary consideration.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.230 align:middle line:10%
The builder's
knowledge of astronomy

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:10%
was incredible at that time.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:10%
We have the last mystery to
unveil on the east of Giza.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:10%
What was the purpose of the
so-called Amenhotep II Temple,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:10%
or better, the building on which
Amenhotep II built his temple?

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:10%
The project seems
to have been avoided

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:10%
because it has no possible
correlation with the star,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:10%
due to lack of astronomical
element in the sky east

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Lion constellation.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:10%
Why did the builders
build it in that position?

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:10%
The first detail is
the anomalous position

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:10%
of the temple, then the
geographical points.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:10%
We all know that all monuments
of Giza pointed to them,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:10%
but the temple is
totally out of place,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:10%
much more than
Khentkaus' mastaba.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:10%
I worked very hard to
understand the ratio

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:10%
of the original building
on which Amenhotep II built

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:10%
this temple during
the New Kingdom.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:10%
I believe I found the key
to unveiling its purpose.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:10%
If we draw a circle from
the temple northeast

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:10%
corner toward the west,
and then another circle

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:10%
from the same corner
toward the east,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:10%
we obtain two
intersected circles

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:10%
forming a vesica piscis.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.470 align:middle line:10%
Exactly as the ecliptic crosses
the Lion constellation's pose,

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:10%
represented by the star
Regulus, so the two circles

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:10%
cross the Sphinx pose.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:10%
So its disposition
was not accidental,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:10%
but it had a precise function,
to fix the ecliptic plane

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:10%
at 36,400 before Christ.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.860 align:middle line:10%
The lost civilization of Giza
left a new incredible detail

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:10%
on Earth to convey the message
of their existence, a kind

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:10%
of message in a bottle
through the millennia

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:10%
to demonstrate their knowledge.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:10%
In this way, they signed
the Age of the Gods, when

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:10%
the Zep Tepi began,
during the Lion Age,

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:10%
in 36,400 before Christ.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.100 align:middle line:10%
During the '90s,
many researchers

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:10%
believe that two sphinxes were
built on the Giza Plateau.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:10%
But despite archaeological
campaigns at the time,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:10%
they found no evidence of
the second sphinx at Giza.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:10%
Then why did some
researchers believe

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:10%
that the builders conceived
the second lion in Giza

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:10%
tens of thousands of years ago?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:10%
I believe they were
misled by an image

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:10%
from the tomb of Tuthmose III
showing two sphinxes inscribed

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:10%
beneath a pyramid.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:10%
The image describes the core
of the Egyptians theology.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:10%
The pharaoh's soul travels
toward the region of the Duat,

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:10%
through the pitfalls of the
night, assisted by the gods.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:10%
Duat is the origin of the
afterlife that Osiris ruled.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Due to the stellar origins
of the Egyptians' theology,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:10%
Duat was associated with a
particular region of the sky

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:10%
during the Old Kingdom.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:10%
According to some researchers,
it was symbolically

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:10%
positioned between the Orion
constellation and Sirius

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:10%
or Taurus constellation.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:10%
Many scholars
suggest that the Duat

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:10%
was between the
constellations of the north.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:10%
In short, the matter
is still unclear.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, that image caused
many debates at the time,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:10%
and Zahi Hawass was
involved in investigations

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:10%
to find evidence of
an ancient basement.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:10%
On the east of Giza, a majestic
Sphinx is carved in the rock.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:10%
In the west, there is nothing.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:10%
Did the Egyptians make
a mistake describing

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:10%
two sphinxes in their
image of the afterlife?

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:10%
It would have been
the first time

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:44.890 align:middle line:10%
we had incorrect information
from the Dynastic Age.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:10%
I went to Giza in 2014
to study the area,

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:10%
looking for clues suggesting
a possible solution

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:10%
to the mystery.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:10%
After some weeks, I found
a possible solution.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:10%
I also found evidence
in the astronomical

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:10%
map I used to unveil the
mysteries of Khentkaus' mastaba

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:10%
and the temples to the east.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:13.640 align:middle line:10%
I have always believed that the
study of Giza is very complex.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:10%
One of the limits of
archaeo-astronomical

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:20.200 align:middle line:10%
investigations is
highlighted by the fact

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:10%
that they focused on only
one section of the sky.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:10%
They have never studied the
sky connected with monuments

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:10%
from east to west.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.630 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, if the lost
civilization of the pyramids

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:10%
built all monuments connected
with the stars, planets,

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.310 align:middle line:10%
and constellations, it
is possible they also

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:10%
built the monuments in the
west linked to the stars.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:10%
It is already apparent
they replicated

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:10%
the entire celestial
vault on Giza, exactly

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:10%
from east to west.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:10%
I was aware that there
was a monument connected

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:00.445 align:middle line:10%
to the primary planning.

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:10%
Now let's watch the astronomical
map at the alignment of 36,400

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:10%
before Christ.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:10%
We have already observed
the perfect relationship

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:10%
between the Sphinx and
the Lion constellation,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:10%
and between the temples and
two planets in the east,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:10%
between the pyramids
and the Orion's belt,

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:10%
and between the Khentkaus'
mastaba and the star

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Sirius in the south.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:10%
Now we must focus on the
west of the astronomical map.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:10%
In the center of the
map, let's consider

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:10%
the Orion constellation
as the starting point.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:10%
The green line is the ecliptic.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.150 align:middle line:10%
Now let's follow its path
until the point referring

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.630 align:middle line:10%
to the autumn equinox
in the west of the sky,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:10%
where the ecliptic
meets the horizon line.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Exactly west and slightly
below the celestial horizon,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:10%
the Aquarius
constellation is perfectly

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:10%
in a position to the
Lion constellation.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:10%
Therefore if the lost
civilization of Giza

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:10%
reproduced the celestial
vault on Earth,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:10%
it's very probable they
built a monument reminding us

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:10%
of the Aquarius constellation
and not the Lion.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:10%
The Aquarius position
in the sky slightly

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:10%
below the celestial horizon
has fascinating details

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:10%
because, first, the monument is
not visible from the pyramids,

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:10%
such as the constellation is
not visible from the point

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:10%
of observation, that is
to say, from the center

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:10%
of the west side of
the Khafre's pyramid.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:10%
Second, esoterically, it
has excellent symbolism

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:10%
because the west connects
to the place of rest,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:10%
the place of death,
the last step

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:10%
before entering a new
dimension, acquiring

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.130 align:middle line:10%
a new status of wisdom.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:10%
In this case, we have
an intriguing detail

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:10%
to investigate.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:10%
Aquarius and wisdom,
symbolically water and soul,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:10%
what is the
connection with Giza?

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:10%
In 1923, a German scientist,
Max Ludwig Paul Blanckenhorn,

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.530 align:middle line:10%
found clues of an ancient river
on Libyan-Mediterranean coasts.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.520 align:middle line:10%
He dated the river
to 50,000 years ago

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:10%
and he called it Ur Nil,
or "twinned with the Nile."

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:10%
The river flowed across the
desert between Libya and Egypt,

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and he noted that those
intriguing artificial conduits

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:10%
characterize the
river in some places.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:10%
It probably originated from the
sea and contains salt water.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:10%
Michael Hoffman confirmed
the study in his book, "Egypt

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:10%
Before the Pharaohs--

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:06.800 align:middle line:10%
The Prehistoric Foundation
of Egyptian Civilization."

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:10%
Also in 1929, the
University of Chicago

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:10%
published the results of
a geological research made

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:10%
by Stuart Sandford and
William Joscelyn Arkell

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:21.200 align:middle line:10%
in the Faiyum region
in the south of Egypt.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:10%
They also found ancient
conduits and minor rivers

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:10%
originated from
the Faiyum region

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.030 align:middle line:10%
and directed north of
Egypt across the desert.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:10%
Salt water characterized
those conduits.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:10%
So we have many clues indicating
a possible correlation

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:10%
between Giza, salt
water, and monuments.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:10%
But what is the
meaning of all this?

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:10%
Maybe in the ancient past,
the lost civilization

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids built
an artificial basin

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:10%
in the west of Giza.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.545 align:middle line:10%
And if so, where was it built?

00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx is 663
meters from the center

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:10%
of the second pyramid, with
a geographical direction

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.660 align:middle line:10%
of 277.5 degrees northwest.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:10%
Moving towards the west with
the same geographical direction

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:10%
and respecting the same
distance of 663 meters,

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:10%
we join the ridge close to the
NC2 Tomb, or Tomb of the Birds.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:10%
NC2 Tomb has fascinating shapes.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Its entrance is
carved from the rock.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:10%
After the entrance,
there are some chambers

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:10%
where the Egyptologists found a
great number of mummified ibis.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:10%
At the bottom, many natural and
artificial conduits originated.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:10%
They look like pipes going
towards the underground of Giza

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.790 align:middle line:10%
to the pyramids.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:10%
Many others are still
blocked and many others

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:10%
are still unexplored.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:10%
But some of them were
explored years ago,

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:10%
revealing some
intriguing traces.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:10%
The conduits have many
clues of water erosion

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:10%
and in some points are
so clear the evidence

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:10%
of sodium crystals.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:35.250 align:middle line:10%
It means that conduits were
full of salt water that

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:10%
flowed to the pyramids
in the distant past.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:10%
With that in mind, I can
assume that the so-called Tomb

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:10%
NC2, or Tomb of the Birds,
is the last wonder of Giza.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:10%
According to the
Hermetic concept,

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.380 align:middle line:10%
as above, so below,
the builders replicated

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.220 align:middle line:10%
the entire celestial vault
on the Giza Plateau, which

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:10%
involved the west
side with a monument

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:10%
correlated to the
Aquarius constellation.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:10%
What information can we receive
from the primary planning

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.070 align:middle line:10%
of Giza?

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:10%
First, the builders complete
the celestial vault on Earth

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:10%
to leave a precise
message of their time

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:10%
through the astronomical
correlation.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:10%
Second, the NC2 Tomb
gives a precise indication

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:10%
of the purpose of the
pyramids and the basic process

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:10%
for producing energy
by using nature,

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:10%
according to the
dimensionless number

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:10%
137 I discovered in
2011, in the section

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:10%
of the second pyramids of Giza.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:10%
Now we have all factors to show
the primary planning of Giza

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.290 align:middle line:10%
for the first time
after 38,000 years.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the
astronomical map

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:08.300 align:middle line:10%
seems to be drawn in
three different sections,

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:10%
as if they obtained the map
from three different observation

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:10%
points.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:10%
First, the east of Giza
with Sphinx and temples

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:10%
connected to the
east side of the sky,

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.400 align:middle line:10%
