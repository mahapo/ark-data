>> The secret is out.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a phenomenon
that's sweeping the world.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is it?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.180 align:middle line:10%
Some claim it's the key that
unlocks the greatest treasure

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.350 align:middle line:10%
chest of all--

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:10%
the power of the universe.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And it can be used to fulfill
all your dreams and desires.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Are these claims just
wishful thinking?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Or could there be some
truth behind them?

broken.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I learned about
the law of attraction.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:90%
And everything changed.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to attract the
love I wanted in my life.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In my line of work,
you don't make the sales,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:90%
you're out of business.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:10%
But everything
turned around when

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I learned about the secret
that controls the universe--

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:10%
the law of attraction.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> This is our dream home.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But we were almost going
to lose it, because we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:90%
couldn't make the payments.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
>> But thankfully, we discovered
the law of attraction.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
money in the bank.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Our home is secure.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are really looking
forward to our future together.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%

the power of the universe

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%

Some say you can by
using a powerful tool

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:90%
called the law of attraction.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
But what exactly is this law?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And why would the universe
want to grant your wishes?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
To find out, we'll follow three
of the most inquisitive people

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll ever meet,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Is this for real?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> We're about to find out.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have the power to
attract the success, wealth,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and love you've
always dreamed of?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Might you even be able to
make the world a better place?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And is there more to this
secret of the universe

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:90%
than you've been told?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Join us as we go
beyond the secret

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
so many people have
heard about to find out

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
what's fact, what's
fiction, and how

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you can make the law of
attraction work for you.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:90%

Everyone is looking for
a way to get ahead--

maybe even find a better future.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be
great if you could

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
have everything you wanted
just by thinking about it?

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction
says you can.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
But is it really that easy?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Meet Pete, Hope, and Eddie--

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
investigative reporters
for a college newspaper.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Their next assignment-- to find
out if the law of attraction

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:90%
really works.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do we start?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Is thee law of
attraction myth or reality?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.962 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we need to know.

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The law of attraction says
that everything that's come

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
into your life is what you've
attracted to you through

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:90%
your own thoughts.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And by learning to
control your thoughts,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
you can attract anything
your heart desires.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Can our truth seeking
trio find out if there's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:90%
anything to all of this?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, but--

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:10%
>> First, they'll need to find
out everything they can about

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:10%
this law of attraction-- like
how is it supposed to work.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Next, they'll need to determine
if it has any limitations

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.895 align:middle line:90%
or requirements.

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:90%
In other words, are there--

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --any rules of the game?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they'll
need to explore the power

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:90%
behind the secret.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.894 align:middle line:84%
Just who or what is
granting all those wishes?

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So where do they begin?

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Ask the experts.

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you really have
anything your heart desires?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a genie in
a bottle just waiting

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to grant your wishes?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more
complicated than that?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:84%
To find out, Pete,
Hope, and Eddie

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
have decided to turn to
the experts for what else?

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Some expert advice.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea of the law of
attraction is that people are

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that we live in
a world or in a universe

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:10%
that's full of
energy and that we,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:10%
being lesser energy fields
within a larger energy field,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.962 align:middle line:10%
that we actually interact with
that by virtue of the images

00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:10%
that we hold in our mind or
the thoughts that we hold

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:10%
in our mind.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And the suggestion is that both
positive and negative things

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
can be drawn to us, because
as we focus upon them,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:84%
something is sort
of emitted almost

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
like waves from the human mind
that begin to cause things

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.457 align:middle line:90%
to come to a person.

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they call
it the law of attraction.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Your focus, your
thoughts, your images

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that you hold in your
mind begin to attract

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
both positive and
negative things.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the simple principle
of cause and effect.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
A father gives his
daughter a gentle push.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
That push causes the
girl and the bicycle

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
to move through space.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The moon's gravitational
pull causes the ebb and flow

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
of the tides.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And man's understanding
and utilization

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.432 align:middle line:84%
of the laws of physics allowed
him to reach the moon itself.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:10%
>> That's one
small step for man,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:10%
one giant leap for mankind.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The same principle of
cause and effect is at work

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:90%
in the law of attraction.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It says that everything
that's come into your life

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
is what you've attracted to
you through your own thoughts.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Control your thoughts.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can attract
the things you desire--

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
everything from successful
careers and relationships

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to fabulous wealth
and possessions--

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in short, all the best
the world has to offer.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Just how is all this
supposed to be accomplished?

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
According to some law
of attraction fans,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics indicates
that everything in this world,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
even in the universe,
is really energy.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That means human beings
are composed of energy.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And the way in which that
energy flows out of you

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
affects your life
in innumerable ways.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you are the cause.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And your life, including
the house you live in,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the car you drive, the
relationships you cherish,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
even the amount of money
you have in the bank

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
is an effect or a result of
the way you use that energy.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Author Sandra Taylor, an
advocate of this view,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
has a theory on
how it all works.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, think
about it this way.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:10%
We're all like little
radio stations broadcasting

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:10%
our own signal about ourselves
and what we expect out of life.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
You see, our personal
energy moves outward from us

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and resonates with other
situations and people

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
of like energy.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And the people and situations
that match our energy

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
will tune into us and be drawn
into our life experience.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:10%
>> What quantum physics
indicates to me is that

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:10%
anything we imagine
can be surpassed.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Anything we think is the
limit of it all can be-- there

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:10%
can always be found
something beyond that limit.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of energy
controlling the world around us

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
is nothing new.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You see its cause and
effect at work every day.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:10%
If you key in the numbers
of a very specific signal

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:10%
to your cell phone and

they're ready to conduct

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:84%
the question, can we really
talk with the universe

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:90%
through energetic vibrations?

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Advocates of the law
of attraction point

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to a controversial
phenomenon in quantum physics

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
called observer
determines reality--

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
or some call it observer

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to support the idea that we can
manipulate the world around us.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Watch the coin as it
spins on the tabletop.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it heads?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:10%
Or is it tails?

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:90%
The answer is neither.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the coin is spinning,
we cannot determine what it will

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
be when it falls.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
But we can find out.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The laws of physics
tell us the coin did not

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
have a property of being heads
or tails while it was spinning.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But it did have the probability
of being one or the other.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
When the coin is
flattened on the table,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
it has a 50% chance of
being one or the other.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But the law of attraction says
we can determine the outcome

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%
without even touching the coin.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's all done through
our energetic vibrations.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.705 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say
Eddie wants the coin

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:46.505 align:middle line:90%

and by focusing on it,
change the outcome.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%

if by observing the situation,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
they can change the normal
outcome in some way.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:10%
we can only get negative back.

one that has been
around since man

all throughout

that when you put
something into the ground,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:90%
it brings something else.

Or when you sow something--
a kindness in your life--

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
it brings that
kindness back to you.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
In a very real way, the
law of sowing and reaping

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.243 align:middle line:84%
allows you to sort of
predict your life--

00:12:25.243 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to have a
better marriage, that you

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
can actually do some things
that will produce that better

marriage.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%

a better financial life,

financial life.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Then it seems that the
law of attraction--

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
why it's so appealing to the
masses is because it's really

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.142 align:middle line:84%
talking about people taking
charge over their lives--

00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
victims about everything

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that happens in the world, that
they can actually stop and say,

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I can do something about
my life and do something

about the tone of
my friendships,

the tone of my family,
the tone of my marriage.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%

it's very helpful.

about if you want a good crop,

you're going to have
to sow good seed.

talks about if a person sows
evil or plows evil things,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:10%
then they're going to reap
exactly what they sow.

the Bible.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a closer
look at that statement.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Jesus did not teach
the law of attraction

as it is being presented.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%

statements He made

could be interpreted as being
supportive of that concept.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
One prime example is the parable
of the unforgiving servant.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
A servant owed a king a
large amount of money--

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
10,000 talents-- which
according to some sources

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is about $150 million in
modern currency, a huge debt

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:90%
to say the least.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:90%
He had no money to pay.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And so he begged the
king for forgiveness,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
which he extended to him.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But then the same
servant went out

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and found a fellow servant,
who owed him a mere 100 dinar--

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
some say about $12
in modern currency.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
He took him by the throat and
said, pay me what you owe.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:90%
He had no money to pay.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So he had him sent to prison.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The king heard about it
and told the first servant

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.090 align:middle line:84%
that he would have to
receive the same treatment

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and be sent to prison.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
The illustration is this-- that
because he sowed unforgiveness,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:90%
like attracted like.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%

unforgiveness.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is
the universe that

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:90%
supposedly grants our wishes?

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Turns out, opinions vary.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:10%
>> In Eastern religions, such
as Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:10%
Taoism, and many new
age and yoga groups,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:10%
the chanting TO mantras is
considered can be a powerful

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:10%
tool.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The same phrase is repeated over
and over, sometimes hundreds,

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:90%
even thousands of times.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And practitioners believe that
by this repetitious statement,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
they can activate the
universal force that

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
will cause the concept within
the mantra to become a reality.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So Eastern religions try
to dial into something

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:90%
they call the universal force.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But that still doesn't
tell our collegiate crew

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:84%
what they're supposed
to be trusting in.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.188 align:middle line:84%
So is there anything
else to go on?

00:20:59.188 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're a believer
in the law of attraction,

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:10%
you put your faith
in the natural order,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:10%
which you also believe
is a spiritual presence

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:10%
and a spiritual order, whereas
in the great monotheistic face

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth--

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.280 align:middle line:10%
and that is the
belief in one God--

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:10%
they believe in God who is
apart from the created order.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:90%
So Islam believes in Allah.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They believe He was
a creator of God.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Judaism believes in Yahweh
and the God of Israel,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
who is the God of the
Old Testament, the Hebrew

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:90%
scriptures, who made all things.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Christians
also believe in that same God.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But they have a personal
faith in Christ.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those faiths
believe in a personal God,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:10%
who made the created order.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:10%
The law of attraction
believes in a spirit force,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:10%
who is the created order.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Proponents of the law of
attraction often try to give it

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:10%
a mainstream component by
quoting passages from the New

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Testament.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, Jesus
did talk about if you

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
have the faith of
a mustard seed,

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:90%
you can actually move mountains.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible says that if
you asked and pray believing,

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
you will receive.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.853 align:middle line:10%
Now this may sound like
the law of attraction.

00:22:12.853 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:10%
But it's actually not.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:10%
When you take the New
Testament in context,

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:10%
you're always asking
Jesus in the name of God

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:10%
to provide things for
you to glorify God.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The Bible clearly warns that
God does not promise to fulfill

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:10%
the requests of those who ask
in order to satisfy earthly

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.790 align:middle line:10%
or sensual desires.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
In The Book of James, it
says, you ask and receive not,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
because you ask
with wrong motives

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that you might spend
it on your pleasures.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Why, then, does it appear
that some people are very

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
successful in implementing
the law of attraction,

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
even if they have
no faith in God?

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Faith is a very
powerful force,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
even when it is not
directed toward God.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Even basically
atheistic people can

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:84%
see good results in their
life by implementing

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.740 align:middle line:90%
positive thinking.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the universe
that grants them their wishes.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.961 align:middle line:84%
It's merely the fruit of their
own positive thought life.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:10%
The currency at stake here,
I think, is who's in control.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:10%
Is it God?

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:10%
Or is it humans?

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And you know, from a
Christian perspective,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:10%
we want to look at
our lives as being

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:10%
sort of being part of a
story that God is telling,

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.524 align:middle line:10%
not a story that we're
making up for ourselves.

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:34.232 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
that, we come with sort

00:23:34.232 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
of an attitude of humility,
an attitude of openness,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
sort of wanting to
say, God, I don't

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
want to be the initiator, the
instigator of everything that

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I want, as Jesus taught us,
to pray, thy kingdom come.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:90%
not thy kingdom come.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:90%
My will be done.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, there seem to
be plenty of people who find

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
success with the
law of attraction,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
but profess no religious faith.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean there are
no limits to its power?

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
At first glance,
it might seem so.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But there is a catch that
even the secret's greatest

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:90%
proponents acknowledge.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:10%

desperation and urgent energy.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a function of the law
of paradoxical intent, which

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:84%
says that the more desperate you
are to achieve a certain goal,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the more that urgent energy will
push that goal away and create

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
the opposite or the paradox
of what you really desire.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one of the most
difficult aspects of the law

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:90%
of attraction to accept.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
According to some proponents,
the universe cannot distinguish

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
between our negative thoughts
and our positive thoughts.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if we
think positive thoughts,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
we draw positive
things to ourselves.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But if our thoughts are
negative or fearful,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
we draw these things
to ourselves as well.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:10%
So if we are asking the universe
to make sure something does not

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:10%
happen, it is the same as
asking for it to happen.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The mere fact that we
are thinking about it

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%

you've attracted to yourself,
what you're sort of suggesting

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
in the law of attraction is
not only are you a victim

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of your situations
that are negative.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%

But I mean, I think
that there are

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that we need to
own that we attract ourselves

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.952 align:middle line:84%
that would be negative, like
debt and bad friendships

Or what if I get sick and die?

from nagging concerns about
being judged to utter panic

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:90%
about being abandoned.

Thoughts such as, I'm not
good enough or I'm not worthy

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:10%
our view of the known world.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:10%
For the first time
in history, we

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:58.300 align:middle line:10%
know that something
truly exists--

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:10%
that there is an entity
which truly exists.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In the search for answers
to the question of the origin

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, has science
accidentally stumbled upon

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
the fingerprints of an
intelligent creator?

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a dilemma modern
scientists never anticipated--

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:84%
something previously reserved
for world religions, not

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:90%
cosmology.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But is there an intersection
between these spiritual views

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.120 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and the
latest scientific findings?

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And how does all this relate
to the law of attraction?

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Most religions
have at their core

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
a desire to communicate
with the divine.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:84%
How or if this
communication takes

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.045 align:middle line:84%
place depends on one's
belief in the nature of God.

00:35:43.045 --> 00:35:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>> In Eastern religions,
the universe is not seen

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:10%
as a rational, ordered
universe that actually reveals

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:10%
God's glory.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Hinduism,
the dominant belief

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.935 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
is an illusion.

00:35:58.935 --> 00:36:01.770 align:middle line:90%
The Hindu term is Maya.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Ultimate reality
is Brahman, that

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:84%
veils itself in the
appearance of physical matter.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.810 align:middle line:84%
But on the highest level,
the universe actually is God.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Absent from this
mindset is the concept

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of a creator having
authority over the universe

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and making moral demands.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
Judaism and Christianity

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
have at their core a belief
in a personal God, not

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.390 align:middle line:90%
an impersonal, universal force.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.920 align:middle line:84%
God has control over all things
and has a system of rules,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and yet amazingly still
allows for man's free will.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>> When you bring sort of the
goals and the mission that you

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.825 align:middle line:10%
believe in to bear in the light
of the creator and understand

00:36:45.825 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:10%
that there's a creator aback all
this and that the very impulse

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:10%
within them to want to care
beyond themselves is from God--

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:10%
and then if folks would
orient themselves,

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:10%
they'd find out that that
impulse would sharpen.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It would be less
selfish, oriented

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to wanting a personal
anything out of it.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And it would also have
a sense that you're

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
participating in
something that is

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:90%
a dream that the creator had--

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:90%
why we're here to begin with.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And it just simply
enriches and empowers

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:90%
what anyone wants to do.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.463 align:middle line:84%
I think we become
more fully human when

00:37:17.463 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
we connect with the creator.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as the law
of attraction goes,

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
does it make a difference
whether you believe

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in a personal God or
an impersonal universe?

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:84%
The experts say yes, because
by understanding the source,

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.640 align:middle line:84%
you can understand the
rules by which it operates.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's recap.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So far, OUR curious
college students

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
have discovered that when
using the law of attraction,

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the source that
grants the wishes

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.190 align:middle line:84%
requires pure motives,
an absence of fear,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and faith or trust.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But is there another
key that is needed

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:90%
to unlock the secret door?

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.750 align:middle line:10%
>> When people understand the
human application of quantum

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:10%
physics, they can see the
great power that consciousness,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:10%
intention, and energy
carries in the consequences

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:10%
of their lives.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
What they fail to comprehend
is the importance of love.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Love is a very real power
within both the universe

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:90%
and individuals.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy that can
be deeply felt, not just

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:90%
romantically, but in every way.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Its strong, vibrating,
creative force

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
moves freely and fluidly
throughout the world.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:84%
When we align our own
personal energy of love

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
with this universal current,
there's absolutely nothing

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.300 align:middle line:90%
we can't achieve.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:10%
>> We, with the
law of attraction,

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:10%
can begin to look at our
lives, look at our friendships,

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:10%
look at our families, look
at our jobs like our careers.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just
seeing what is,

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to
imagine what can be.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
engage in what can be,

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that sort of creative
force that, I think,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.125 align:middle line:84%
is a part of the
divine reflection in us

00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
as we're made in the
likeness and the image of God

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:90%
begins to come to bear.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And life begins to change.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like the universe
is some big vending machine

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that's going to grant all
your wishes no matter what

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.450 align:middle line:84%
your deeper thoughts
and motives are.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't expect your
wishes to come true

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
if those wishes show
no compassion, love,

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:90%
or concern for others.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> As the song goes,
all you need is love.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But how do we incorporate
love into our use

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.480 align:middle line:90%
of the law of attraction?

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
well-known examples

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.980 align:middle line:84%
comes from the New
Testament Book of Luke.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Speaking to his disciples, Jesus
put forth a radical notion--

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.240 align:middle line:84%
one that goes against every
natural human impulse.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Love your enemies.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Do good to those who hate you.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:10%
And lend to them without
expecting to get anything back.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Then in the Book of Matthew,
Jesus says, love your enemies.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:10%
And pray for those
who persecute you.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes life gets tough.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're having difficulties
with another situation

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:84%
or another person,
sending loving energy

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:84%
is a very valuable tool
in creating resolution.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.540 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:90%
You just repeat the word love.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Or you say a prayer for the
highest and best resolution

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.420 align:middle line:90%
for all concerned.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
In time, you'll feel your
own emotions changing.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you repeat
this process whenever

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the issue comes to mind,
you'll see a major shift

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
in the situation too.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:10%
>> An amazing thing happens when
you begin to consistently pray

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.570 align:middle line:10%
for your enemies.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:10%
It changes your heart.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:10%
It releases you
from the emotions

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:10%
of bitterness and hate.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:84%
As far as the law
of attraction goes,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:84%
proponents would say that these
negative emotions, these wrong

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:84%
thoughts are
blocking your ability

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to attract those
things, these desires

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:84%
you really want into
your personal life.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe what's really
happening on a higher

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.585 align:middle line:90%
level is this power of love--

00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not talking
about love as an emotion.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about love
as a decision, an action.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:90%
You're taking the higher road.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're changing the
situation by changing you.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
When we make the
choice to love people,

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.170 align:middle line:84%
it naturally moves us away
from those selfish desires.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not about things.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not, then, about
money or fame or wealth.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.640 align:middle line:90%
You're taking the higher road.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.848 align:middle line:90%
It's about benefiting others.

00:41:21.848 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The human life, apart from
any encounter with the creator,

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:10%
is sort of, as the great
theologian Augustine

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:10%
in the fourth century said,
we're sort of our wills are

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:10%
incurvadas.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
He meant that it's
curved upon itself--

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.995 align:middle line:84%
that we can't love
rightly-- that when

00:41:40.995 --> 00:41:43.120 align:middle line:84%
we say we love things, we
really don't love things.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.828 align:middle line:84%
We just love how the
things make us feel.

00:41:44.828 --> 00:41:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So the glutton doesn't love
how-- really love food.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The glutton just loves
how food makes him feel.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:90%
The miser doesn't love money.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The miser just loves how she
feels when she counts it.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't that we
can love anything.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:10%
And so a person
that's sort of running

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.190 align:middle line:10%
it using the law of attraction
apart from any kind of aspect

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:10%
of faith or any kind of
accountability to faith,

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:10%
I think you'll find out
that on some real way,

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be lots of
selfishness, lots of skirting

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:10%
around ethics at
points where you're not

That would refer to it
as a gambler's fallacy,

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.210 align:middle line:10%
because you're appealing
to an infinite sample

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:10%

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, the theory
of general relativity

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:84%
tells us once you've got
observers in universe A,

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the spacetime envelope can never
overlap the spacetime envelope

existing universe.

the universe reincarnates.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:90%
and the next beginning.

or cosmic forces creating
within space and time that

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.290 align:middle line:90%
always exists.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.960 align:middle line:10%
The Bible is unique
in that it makes

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.900 align:middle line:10%
the comment that God creates
independent of space and time.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what I find

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.890 align:middle line:84%
all the fundamentals
of Big Bang cosmology

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.800 align:middle line:84%
were stated in the
Bible thousands of years

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.690 align:middle line:84%
before any of these concepts
were even dreamed of--

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:01.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, the concept of a
continuous expanding universe.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:84%
That was unique to the Bible
until the 20th century.

a holy book actually predicting

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, oh, wow.

00:56:05.496 --> 00:56:06.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:56:06.452 --> 00:56:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, enjoy.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Have fun.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Be happy.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I will.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so cool.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems in the end our trio
got the positive results they

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.210 align:middle line:90%
were looking for.

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.435 align:middle line:84%
Just not in the way
they had anticipated.

00:56:18.435 --> 00:56:20.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Law of attraction--

00:56:20.534 --> 00:56:22.025 align:middle line:90%
myth or reality?

00:56:22.025 --> 00:56:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Looks like a reality to me.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the law of
attraction work?

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The evidence seems
to point that way.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But as Eddie, Pete,
and Hope discovered,

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:38.660 align:middle line:84%
there is more to it than
just thinking good thoughts.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The big question, of course,
is, can it work for you?

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Can you now use your
inside knowledge

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of the law of attraction to
communicate with the real power

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.680 align:middle line:90%
behind the universe?

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Will your heartfelt
prayers be answered?

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the best way
to find out is to try.
