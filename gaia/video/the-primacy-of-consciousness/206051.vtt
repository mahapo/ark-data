00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Brenda
Dunne, and for 28 years,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I served as the laboratory
manager of the Princeton

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Engineering Anomalies
Research, or PEAR program,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
at Princeton University.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I worked with
Professor Robert Jahn,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
who spent 15 years as dean
of the School of Engineering.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:90%
He was an aerospace scientist.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:10%
He had become interested
in looking at human machine

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:10%
anomalies, and he was
able to get funding for it

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:10%
from a colleague of his in
the aerospace business, James

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:10%
McDonnell, who was the patriarch
of McDonnell Aircraft Company.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:10%
He felt that it was important
for an aerospace point of view

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:10%
to understand this because they
were so-called gremlins that

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:10%
were observed sometimes
in aircraft under very

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:10%
tense emotional
situations, and he thought

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:10%
we needed to understand it.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:10%
He told Bob, if you set
up a program at Princeton,

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:10%
I'll fund it.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And then when Bob and
I met at a conference

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
where I was giving a talk
about my remote viewing work,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
he told me he was
setting up the program,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
asked me if I'd be interested
in working with him.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I sure would.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's
how we started.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%
This was back in 1979.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
People came in and always
looked surprised to find this

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:90%
in the engineering school.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:10%
We had three main
portions-- one of them

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:10%
was a series of experiments
in what we called

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:10%
a human machine anomalies.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
These were a function sort
of like coin flipping.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
If you flip a coin,
you have a 50-50 chance

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:90%
of a head or a tail.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
In these experiments, you had a
50-50 chance of a one or a zero

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
or a ball that bounced to
the left or to the right.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And people would just try to
get more ones or more zeros

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:84%
or just let the machine run
in a controlled condition

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:90%
without thinking anything.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:10%
So the primary variable that
we studied in these experiments

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:10%
was human intention,
and the intentions

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:10%
were recorded ahead of time,
both in a computer file

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:10%
and in a log book.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
All of the devices were
very carefully calibrated

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
so we knew that we were
dealing with processes that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
were reliable, that
left to themselves

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:90%
would produce a random output.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The idea was we would just
tell people, try to get

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:90%
the mean high or the mean low.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:10%
It was a statistical process.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:10%
But over many hundreds
or thousands or indeed,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:10%
millions of binary
events, you could

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:10%
get a distribution output.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:10%
And you could see that the
mean of that distribution

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:10%
was ever so slightly shifted,
correlated with the intentions

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:10%
that people had determined.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:10%
As I say a very tiny effect, but
over many millions of trials,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:10%
a highly significant effect
that could not occur by chance.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Particularly if the machine is
going this way when people want

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
it to go that way and
going this way when

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
they want it to go
this way, there's

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
no way that you can
explain that otherwise.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's also important
to point out that when

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
we talk to our participants,
they frequently would tell us,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
there's more to having an
intention to make this work.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I have to have an emotional
connection with the process.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I have to feel like the machine
is an extension of myself.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to develop a relationship
with the device that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:90%
is meaningful.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just intention.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We realized very early on
that although we thought

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we were studying,
or we had set out

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:84%
to study the effect or the
vulnerability of engineering

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
systems, we realized
that we were looking

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:90%
at something far more profound.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at
how can consciousness,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
how can non-sensory
intention have

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
a tangible and measurable
effect on a physical system.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
our program was a body

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
of research in remote viewing.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
There would be two
people involved.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
One would be an agent
who would go out

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to some assigned-- randomly
assigned location somewhere

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:90%
without knowing ahead of time.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.244 align:middle line:84%
Just get an envelope that
would say go to the duh, duh,

00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
duh, duh at such
and such a time.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:10%
The other person is
called the percipient

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:10%
would be somewhere else,
sometimes thousands of miles

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:10%
away.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Their task was to
try to visualize,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
try to sense where the agent was
located at the assigned time.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So we explored probably
a couple of dozen

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
different analytical
algorithms or recipes.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We felt we wanted to get
a more quantitative handle

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
on how much information
was actually acquired.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
In the course of that, we
generated some several hundred

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:90%
trials.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And even by any
standard, the results

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
came out to be way beyond
what chance would predict--

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
what you would get if
you were just guessing.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness can
acquire information

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
without any sensory
input independently

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of time or distance,
then consciousness

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:90%
is not in the brain.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness
somehow is out there,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:90%
and we are tapping into it.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:90%
It can't be the brain.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it seems to work best
when you turn your brain off.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're quiet and you stop
thinking and stop trying to--

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
where would he be likely to
be, what do I know about him,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:90%
but just shut it down.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes have
told people, try

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
imagining you're
in a movie theater

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and there's this dark screen.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
a movie is going

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to come up on that screen,
and you're going to see it.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to predict what
the movie is going to be.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Just wait until it
starts showing itself.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It worked more often than--
it shouldn't work at all.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Logically, it shouldn't work.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
The third part of the
program was our attempt

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out what was
going on because it was clear

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that these phenomena
could not be explained

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
by any known model or concept,
so that was kind of fun.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there has been
criticism of the PEAR work

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There still is because
what we are demonstrating

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is inconsistent with the
prevailing worldview,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
particularly the prevailing
scientific worldview.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:10%
We have had criticisms
that have dealt

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:10%
with the design
of our equipment,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:10%
with the protocols we've used,
with the analytical techniques

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:10%
we've used.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But we have been
very, very careful

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
those were not factors.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:90%
There is a saying--

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it was from Friedrich
Nietzsche, the philosopher, who

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
said, I should love my
enemy because he brings out

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%
the best in me.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And because we knew
that people were always

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:10%
going to look for some
slip up, some error,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:10%
we were very, very careful.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
All of the devices
were very carefully

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
calibrated to be sure
that they were not

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
subject to any kind of artifact,
temperature, vibrations, air

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:90%
pressure, whatever it may be.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
the experiments we did

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
consisted of very
large databases.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
There was somebody
who once said,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
this is something I wouldn't
believe even if it was true.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
How do you argue
with that logically?

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:10%
There is a big difference
between science

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:10%
as a method of
learning and scientism,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:10%
which is a dogma that
says, we know everything

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:10%
that is necessary to
know, and anything

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't fit into our model
has to be wrong by definition.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I am a big fan of the
method of science,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
which I think is a great
way to learn and to discover

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
new insights in a
particular phenomenon.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:90%
I am a great enemy of scientism.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that from people
who said, but if you're right,

then I'd be wrong.

And I'd say, no, just
you'd be incomplete.

There's more.

The quantum mechanics
principles even

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that observation
is an important part

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.330 align:middle line:90%
of the construction of reality.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
The scientific community,
which, by the way,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
would not even allow the words,
"consciousness" when we started

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in 1979, now accepts that
consciousness is important,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
but their way of going
about trying to study it

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
is to look in the brain.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
They are persuaded
that it's something

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that the brain generates
through its neuronal activity

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
They're having fun doing
it, but they're not

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:84%
going to find consciousness
inside the brain.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
something much vaster.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And I think many
of the phenomena,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:10%
such as out-of-body experiences
or near-death experiences

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:10%
or precognition, indicate
that consciousness is not

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:10%
dependent upon the
brain, but the brain

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:10%
is dependent upon consciousness.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It's as if our brains
work sort of like a radio.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
frequencies and amplitudes

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
filling this room,
but we're not going

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to pick up on them unless we
have a device that we can tune

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
into a particular
set of signals,

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:90%
and then we can pick that up.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But the program
isn't in the radio.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The radio is just a
transducer of those signals,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
think our brains do.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The universe, if
you will imagine,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
is just this vast
field of potentiality.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Nothing absolute but
just possibilities.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Then consciousness
comes and organizes

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.695 align:middle line:84%
that into whatever
it wants it to be.

It's really rather sad that
from the time we're very young

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and we start to
learn language, we

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:10%
tend more and more
in recent years

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:10%
to emphasize the
analytical processes.

What happened to imagination?

What happened to poetry?

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
What happened to music?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Children should be
allowed to just play.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
They should be allowed to
go out and look at nature

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and experience it and look at
the flowers look at the birds.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet we're told, oh,
don't worry about that.

And it's denigrated.

The most creative side of
our being is dismissed,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
and this, I think, is very sad.

sense of meaning, a sense

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
of connection with the world.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't know how to dream.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:90%
We have two basic modes.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:10%
There's a subjective
mode of experience

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:10%
that allows us to
immerse ourselves

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:10%
in a beautiful sunset,
in a concert, in love.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And somehow or other, we have
lost our sense of identity,

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:90%
and we have become one.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
analytical side that says,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I've got to try to describe
this piece of music.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got to try to describe
how I feel about my loved one.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But the description
isn't the experience.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to do both.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
If all we're doing is
describing abstract stuff,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:90%
we're not living.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if all
we're doing is experiencing

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're not describing,
then we're sort of airheads.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think it all comes
from the same dynamic, what

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the ancients, the Taoists,
call the yin yang.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They're not separate.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
They're just two ways of
perceiving or interacting

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that come together,
and that dynamic

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is the source of
everything that becomes.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:10%
One of the most important
parts of the PEAR lab

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:10%
was the dynamic between
Bob and me, yin and yang.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:90%
We were very different.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Bob was very much
the scientist--

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:90%
very analytical, very rigorous.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very much the philosopher,
the mythology reader.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:90%
But we complemented each other.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:10%
We each brought to the program
a different perspective,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:10%
without which the program
never would have happened.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We actually wrote a book
called "Molecular Memories"

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:90%
that described some of this.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the molecule
tends to be greater

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
than the sum of the energy
of the constituent parts.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Neither of us could
have done PEAR alone.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But coming together
and sharing that

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and working together and
respecting one another,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:90%
which is very important.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who interacted
more with the participants.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
I encouraged them.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I made them feel at home.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I made them feel comfortable.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:90%
That was important.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They were part of our family.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Bob was the one that was very
scrupulous in checking out

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the statistics and the
analysis and the technology.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:10%
I think we need both of those.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
For many millions of years,
we didn't separate ourselves

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:90%
from our environment.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
In order to survive,
we became familiar.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We resonated with
the natural world.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
We understood the
intelligence of the animals.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
We understood the nature
of the changing seasons.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think my consciousness
is separate from the world.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:90%
I feel as if I am a part of it.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And through that
sense of connection,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I can have a feeling about
what is going on around me.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
One has to have a
sense of connection

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and belonging to
the bigger picture,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
we need to learn.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to go back to some
of that early knowledge, some

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
of that intuitive knowledge.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We are not only
thinking creatures,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:90%
we're intuitive creatures.

There is nobody
that I can imagine

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't at some point
say, I don't feel good

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
about this situation, or this is
a very attractive opportunity.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
What makes it attractive?

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:90%
What makes it not feel good?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
intellectual, or is it

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
a gut feeling that makes you
be drawn to some situations

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to avoid others?

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:10%
One of the books that we
published through our ICRL

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:10%
Press is called "Syntrophy--

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:10%
The Spirit of Love."

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
It postulates that there is
a principle called synthropy,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
which is the complement
of the principle we

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:90%
know called entropy.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So entropy comes from
the past to the present

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and makes things
more and more complex

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and eventually breaks them
down and eliminates them.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:90%
They becomes chaos.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Syntrophy comes from the
future, from a completed event

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
with the energy that goes
back into the present.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And we'll draw from
the present, whatever

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
is needed to fulfill and
manifest that completed image.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, entropy is
the spirit of division.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Syntropy is the
spirit of integration.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's not either.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:90%
They're complements.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
The world consists
of this dynamic,

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
of things falling apart
and things coming together.

That is difficult.
It is very hard

to convince somebody to take
on a different worldview.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I had this
conversation with Bob Jahn,

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:90%
and we talked about this.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, given
human nature, given

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
its greedy, self-serving
style of being,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:84%
how are you ever going to
convince these people to love?

have been these

have come along and preached
how we should love one another,

think was very profound.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
He said, the only
way you're going

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to get people to love one
another is when you can

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
persuade them that it's in their
own greedy, self-serving best

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:90%
interest to do so.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They need to recognize
that if they don't do it,

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:90%
they're in deep trouble.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:90%
You do it because you have to.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
You do it because it's the
only option you've got left.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
When the despair
becomes so great,

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:84%
either you're going to
get depressed and end up

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
committing suicide,
or you're going

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind
of an epiphany,

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an insight
that suddenly white light,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and you go, oh.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember a story
a friend of mine

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
told of her father who had
been a career Marine, this very

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
serious old guy,
but he was dying.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting at his
bedside, holding his hand.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:90%
He was asleep.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
he opened his eyes,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and he looked at her very alert.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you know what?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all about love, isn't it?

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And it has to come like that.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell people that.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:90%
You can't preach it to them.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
In my own experience, it
was that kind of a thing.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I was very depressed.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I was a very unhappy
young person.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I just felt that nothing
was going to happen.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I had spent my life trying
to please other people.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how hard I tried,
I wasn't able to please them.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They were always critical.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
sudden insight that said,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
you've got to stop trying
to please other people.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you
do, it's not you

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to accept.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
They're accepting that false
face that you're putting on,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's not going
to make you happy.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you be better off
just being who you really are?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And then if people don't like
you, they don't like you.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But the people who do
like you really like you.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We spend so much of
our lives reacting

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
to this terrorizing threat
of what will people think.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But pleasing somebody by
being false is not love,

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and demanding that somebody
behave a certain way

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
so you would love them,
that's not love either.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Love is being who you are
and accepting other people

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%
for who they are.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
How do you get there?

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
There were days when I find the
circumstances in our society

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:90%
terrifying.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Other days, I find
it hilariously funny.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's so bad that
it's really funny.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of us
that is destructive,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that wants to break things
down and create chaos.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And there is a part
of us that wants

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to be drawn together, to
be part of a social group,

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to be in love, to be
part of something bigger.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to choose which
path we're going to follow.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They're both there
potentially, and we're all

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
going to have days when we
go this way and days when

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
we go that way.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But at some level,
we have to choose

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
which path we're going
to make a commitment to.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:90%
What does that?

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
What is it within us that makes
us choose which path to follow?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think we do
have free will.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:90%
I think we can choose.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier, I had
a very unpleasant childhood.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, I was not a happy kid.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I know people who
have had experiences,

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:84%
early experiences akin to what
I had and they become bitter.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They become angry, resentful,
and they carry that pain

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
with them all their lives.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I kind of got out of it
and decided this is not

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:90%
a very productive way to go.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not hurting
anybody but myself.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be
able to love others

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
until we can love
ourselves, and we're not

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:90%
taught to love ourselves.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to be
critical of ourselves.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:90%
We're taught to compete.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to live up to
other people's-- we don't love

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to love ourselves

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
until we accept ourselves
for who we are and say, hey,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I may not be
perfect, but I'm me.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
My colleague, Robert Jahn passed
away almost two years ago.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
His brain is no
longer functioning,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:90%
but I feel his presence.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel his consciousness
because we were so close.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
We worked together.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:90%
We understood each other.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We had such an intense
dynamic for so long.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I know his consciousness
is still there,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and there are times
when I have a thought,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and I get a sense of,
no, that's not right,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's
Bob talking to me.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of evidence
that consciousness is not over

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:90%
just because the body is.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way you're
going to convince people

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
who are skeptical of it,
and I don't feel the need

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.492 align:middle line:90%
to try to convince them.

00:22:23.492 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
We are expressions
of the life force.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We are the manifestation of this
dynamic between consciousness

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and potentiality, the universe
wanting to experience itself.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
There's something precious
about being a part of the whole

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that
there is a whole.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not here all alone.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just here without some
purpose, or why am I here.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.052 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:22:55.052 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make?

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should shoot myself.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
No, I have a purpose
to serve and that

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
is to contribute in whatever
way I can to this whole.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
To be as good a
little cell as I can

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:84%
be because that will
enhance the health

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
of the big organism
in some way even

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:90%
though I don't understand it.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Where people get into a
different state of mind,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they see that
everything's really connected.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:90%
It isn't all separate pieces.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all one big unit.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You just realize that
you're just one little piece

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of the whole, and all of
the pieces are connected,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
and it's beautiful.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It gives you such a
wonderful warm feeling

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%
of purpose and meaning.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't last very long.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:84%
You usually come back down
to Earth, so to speak,

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and you remember that you've
got to go to the grocery store

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
or you've got to
go wash the dishes.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But it carries back
with you some harmony,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
some piece of that that
says, I had that experience.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to doubt it.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry
about somebody else

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or depend on someone
else describing it.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it, I've known
it, and I know it's real.
