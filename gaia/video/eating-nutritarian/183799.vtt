00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Fuhrman,
and I congratulate you

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.570 align:middle line:84%
on your interest in achieving
great health and longevity.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The right food is truly
the best medicine.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you adopt the
principles I share with you

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in this program, you
can prevent and even

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:84%
reverse many chronic diseases,
such as heart disease,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, high blood
pressure, and why not get

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:84%
your body in incredible health
and avoid the tragic diseases

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that afflict most
everyone eating

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:90%
the standard American diet?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The standard American diet,
abbreviated SAD, sad, isn't it?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that
the standard way

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
most people eat in the
United States today

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
virtually guarantees they
will develop heart disease

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and cancer.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't have to be you.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Nutritional science has
made dramatic strides

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in recent years and by
utilizing the knowledge that I'm

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
going to share with you,
these health tragedies simply

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
do not have to happen to you.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
During the course of my
medical practice, which

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
spans over 20 years and
over 10,000 patients,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I have observed the miraculous
power of superior nutrition.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
By taking action now, you don't
have to have a heart attack,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
you do not have
to have a stroke,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
you do not have to get
demented when you get older.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You can apply modern
nutritional science

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:90%
to earn a better, longer life.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, most
Americans are in trouble.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We have the most
overweight population

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the human
race and almost everyone

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
over the age of 60
is taking drugs.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And today, over 60%
of the American diet

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is made up of processed foods,
such as cereals, white flour

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
products, candy bars,
oil, soft drinks,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and other sweetened and
salted refined foods.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
About 30% of the American
diet comes from animal food,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
so less than 10% of the
average person's diet

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is derived from fruits,
vegetables, beans, nuts,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and seeds.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
With a diet like this,
Americans are not

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
getting the micronutrients,
antioxidants,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
and phytochemicals they need.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Micronutrients, which
are vitamins, minerals,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
and phytochemicals, are
deficient in the diet

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
of most Americans.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember, both refined
foods and animal products

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
do not contain a significant
load of antioxidants

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.627 align:middle line:90%
and phytochemicals.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Yet, these are the
micronutrients that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
offer protection against both
heart disease and cancer,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and because of this,
about 40% of Americans

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
die needlessly of heart disease
and strokes, while about 30%

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:90%
die of cancer.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Said in another way,
heart disease and cancer

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
are caused predominantly by a
fruit, vegetable, nut and seed

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.043 align:middle line:90%
deficiency.

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest health
issues facing this country

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:90%
is obesity and related diseases.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Not only do people have trouble
losing their excess weight,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
but when they do lose some
weight counting calories

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
or points, in more than 95% of
cases, they gain it back again.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The popular diets are focused on
reducing calories, so reducing

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:90%
carbohydrates, fats, proteins.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, those macronutrients
are where calories come from.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Some popular diets attempt to
adjust the ratio of one calorie

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
source to another, more protein,
less carbs or more carbs

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%
and less fat.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, while dieting may produce
short term weight loss,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
they do not solve the problem
of food cravings and food

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:90%
addictions.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Without meeting the body's
micronutrient needs,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
people develop food addictions
and get an overwhelming desire

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
to consume more calories
and eat too frequently.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The diet cannot be maintained
long term against the backdrop

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
of unrelenting food cravings
and food addictions.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And any weight loss
is certain to return.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The problem is without
addressing the nutrient quality

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
of one's food choices, the
body remains unsatisfied,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and the drive to overeat
remains simply overwhelming.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
The only effective
strategy for weight loss

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that will be effective,
last forever, and result

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
in excellent health
is to consume

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
sufficient micronutrients found
in fruits, vegetables, beans,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:90%
nuts and seeds.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This strategy will
blunt your desire

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
for non-nutritious foods,
food cravings, and overeating.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
In addition, a
micronutrient rich diet

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
reduces inflammation,
boosts the immune system,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
and slows the aging process.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The most nutrient dense
foods are fruits, beans,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, especially
green vegetables,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
which are the foods most
missing in modern diets.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Nutrient dense foods contain
vital nutrients, vitamins,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
minerals, and phytochemicals
essential for boosting

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
immunity, detoxifying the body,
and delivering permanent weight

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:90%
loss.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But you must eat the real
foods to get the thousands

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:90%
of nutrients food contains.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Processing and refining
foods destroys or removes

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
most of the fragile
protective nutrients.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, the standard
American diet, or SAD,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
contains almost no disease
fighting and health

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
promoting antioxidants,
lignins, and phytochemicals.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, an SAD
diet doesn't even

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
supply 1/10 the
micronutrients humans require

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
to prevent disease and
obtain excellent health.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Without those nutrients, we
promote cellular inflammation,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
leading to heart disease and
brain disease, premature aging,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and of course overeating.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I hope this
presentation encourages

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
you to read one or
more of my books,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
such as "Eat To Live"
or "Super Immunity,"

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of all the food

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
factors that are so vital
to guarantee your success

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and more of the
fascinating science.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.013 align:middle line:84%
We finish our formal education
at high schools and colleges,

00:05:38.013 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and the most
critical knowledge we

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
need to protect our precious
health goes unmentioned.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I hope I can encourage
and motivate you

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to become a nutritarian,
a person who

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
has a preference for foods
that are high in life

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:90%
sustaining micronutrients.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Nutritarians eat lots of
nutrient dense healthy foods,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
such as green vegetables,
fruits, beans, berries, nuts

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and seeds, and they eat
less animal products

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:90%
than conventional eaters.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
They eat almost no white flour,
white sugar, and refined foods.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, I hope
you will come along

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
to see that this
new way of eating

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
can also be fun, delicious, and
a real blessing in your life.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Green vegetables are the most
critical missing elements

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
in modern diets.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Learning to prepare
and enjoy greens

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is essential to creating
health and a body you love.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you nourish
yourself with greens,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
you will naturally
and effortlessly

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
eat less foods that make
you sick and overweight.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Eating both raw greens
and cooked greens

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
are powerfully
protective against cancer

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and extend your lifespan as they
encourage your ideal weight.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Nutritionally, greens are very
high in vitamins, minerals,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and phytochemicals, but they are
also high in protein and fiber.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
When you taste some of my
favorite recipes for greens,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you might find that superfoods,
such as kale, collard greens,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
bok choy, spinach,
and broccoli rabe,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
can actually be prepared
to be a real treat.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember, once you
start to eat for health,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
your food preferences
and tastes will change,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and healthy foods will gain
a new and delicious flavor.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Besides salads and the
green vegetable recipes,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:90%
greens are also great in soups.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
When you steam or
boil vegetables,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
some of the nutrients
get lost in the water.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But when we simmer
vegetables in soup,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
all the nutrients are
retained in a liquid.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And making one big
pot of soup can

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
be used for a great lunch or
dinner for the whole week.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So a cornerstone of my
lifespan enhancing advice

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is to have at least one large
salad as a main dish for lunch

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
or dinner and chew
it thoroughly to get

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:90%
as much nutrition as possible.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Whole Foods,
my favorite store.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking around here,
and just saying, wow.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
When we were kids, we didn't
have such a huge availability

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.087 align:middle line:90%
of foods like this.

00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an
incredible blessing

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
we have in human history and
actually unique opportunity,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
we could take advantage
of high nutrient foods,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and such a spectrum of
nourishment and nutrients

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
This blessing is
enabling us to live

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:84%
longer and better than ever
before in human history.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So welcome and
please join me as we

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:84%
go through some of these great
tasting foods available to us

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
advantages of eating them.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
green vegetables,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:84%
because obviously,
green vegetables

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
score the highest on the
nutrient spectrum or the ANDI

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:90%
score.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Cruciferous vegetables
in particular

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
have been shown to have
the most power to protect

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:90%
against cancer.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
The cruciferous
family of vegetables

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:84%
are the cabbage and
broccoli family.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Over here, we have
some broccoli,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
we have mache and watercress
and different types of cabbages.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But just look at
this for a minute.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Here we have some watercress.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Watercress, one of the
healthiest foods in the world,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.273 align:middle line:90%
and is a great salad vegetables.

00:09:15.273 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, one thing
you want to remember

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
when we're eating
cruciferous vegetables,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
like collard greens--

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.062 align:middle line:90%
these are collard greens, kale.

00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Over here, we have some kale.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Bok choy, and here we
have some regular bok

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
choy with a big white stem
and the small green leaf

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and some baby bok choy,
even with some more green.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, bok choy has more
calcium per calorie than almost

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
any food, and it's also
a cruciferous vegetable

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
rich in phytonutrients
and isothiocyanates.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's these
isothiocyanates, called

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
ITCs, that give cruciferous
vegetables their unique ability

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to defend against cancer
and to detoxify the body

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.128 align:middle line:84%
and to excite the DNA repair
mechanisms in the body.

00:10:10.128 --> 00:10:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
best way to prepare

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
these cruciferous vegetables
like bok choy and collards

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and watercress and
broccoli, the best way

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
to pair him is to eat
a portion of them raw

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and chew them very well,
because the isothiocyanates

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
in the vegetables are liberated
when you crush the cell walls

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and chew them very well.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So cutting them also helps
liberate those compounds.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm taking
the watercress,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
for example, I want to cut
it up for my salad using

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
a sharp knife, and
you make cutting up

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
with very small pieces,
because the more cuts you make

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in the watercress, the more
you create a chemical reaction

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to liberate those beneficial
isothiocyanates, or ITCs.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So watch, I'm going to
slice this watercress

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:90%
in very small little pieces.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I, of course,
dipped it in water.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:90%
I rinsed it off.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm slicing it
for my salad in very, very

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:90%
small little pieces.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So when I take this
watercress, when

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I take this chopped watercress
and put it on my salad,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I've already initiated
this chemical reaction,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.793 align:middle line:90%
because it's chopped watercress.

00:11:23.793 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget
to chew the salad

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
very well because as
you chew the salad,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you liberate more of those
beneficial compounds.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I just remembered last night,
I made this delicious salad

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
where I shredded some cabbage,
I shredded some baby bok choy

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
in the salad raw, and I
put some watercress on top

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
with the lettuce and
tomatoes and cucumbers,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and I also took some
zucchini, which I steamed,

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and I put that in
the salad, too.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Where's that zucchini
I had over here?

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Give me a second.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what I wanted
to show-- here it is.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to show you was
I cut the tip of the zucchini,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and I steamed the
zucchini in the pot whole.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't
cut up the zucchini.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Steam it whole for just
about five minutes,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
so it starts to soften.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you cut it up,
the juices will come out,

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and you'll lose some
of those nutrients.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:84%
After it's cooked,
and it's still firm,

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
then you take this
cooked zucchini,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and you cut it right
down the middle.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you can slice
it like a cucumber.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So now my zucchini
is cooked, and I

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
have this sliced
zucchini, and I sprinkle

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
this right on top
of my salad that

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
was cooked zucchini
on top of the salad

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:90%
with the other raw vegetables.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And I put on this
delicious dressing

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that I made with a
tomato and mushroom sauce

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
with a little vinegar mixed
in and a little almond

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
butter mixed in and a
little bit of very finely

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
chopped red onion mixed
in with the salad,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and I chopped in a little bit
of chopped up, sliced olives

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Had an incredibly
gourmet delicious salad.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
But the key here is
when you eat a salad,

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
you want to chew these nutrients
very well, because most

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
people want to eat a
salad only get about 20%

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients out of it, because
they don't chew it well enough.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So let me review that again, the
main points we just went over.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Number one, when it comes to
the cruciferous vegetables

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
like baby bok choy,
watercress, and kale.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Eat some raw.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't cook all of it.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Chop it up small.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Add it to your salad.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Cover it with a great dressing.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way you get those
anti cancer isothiocyanates

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:90%
into you.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.305 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's move
on, because now when

00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:84%
we cook some of
these vegetables,

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
like kale, kale-- you
know, this is a superfood.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
These are the foods that really
protect you against cancer,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to to
take some of this kale,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and let's add some
kale to our soup.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, I did actually
take some kale yesterday

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.147 align:middle line:84%
and put that and
used it in my lunch.

00:13:52.147 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:84%
What I did with my
lunch with the kale

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
is I took some kale
raw, and I sliced it up

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
finally with my knife,
some finely chopped kale.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you want to make the
kale as small as you possibly

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I put it in the
bottom of my soup bowl,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and I heated up that bowl of
soup, a delicious vegetable

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
bean soup with lots
of garlic and onion,

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and I poured it right
over my raw kale.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So I used my raw kale to
add a little crunchy flavor

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
to the soup that we heated up.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:90%
But now, let's just review.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
This kale, don't forget, one of
the most nutrient dense foods

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.127 align:middle line:84%
in the world, scores 1,000
on the ANDI scoring system.

00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But here's how you
quickly prepare it.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.043 align:middle line:84%
You just take the leaves a
kale, grab it with your hand,

00:14:34.043 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and just strip the leaves
and throw out the steps.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Just strip the leaves
right off with your hand,

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:90%
throw out the stems.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
First, of course,
you rinse it off.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to take
my kale that's rinsed off

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
the stems, and I'm all set
to either steam the kale

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:90%
or make it into the soup.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you a little
secret, a little tip, OK?

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.235 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
I said earlier,

00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that when I chopped up that
watercress really finally,

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I was liberating
those isothiocyanates,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
by chopping it, I was
creating a chemical reaction

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that's occurring right
here in your kitchen,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.570 align:middle line:90%
right on your kitchen counter.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So you could take this kale, and
you can dump it in your super

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:90%
or in your vegetable dish.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you chop it
up first, you're

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
actually going to
increase the compounds

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
in the biologic activity of
those anti cancer nutrients.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you do.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
You chop up the kale, and
then you add it to the soup,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or you throw the
kale and your onion

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and some bok choy
and other vegetables

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
right into a food
processor, and you make it--

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.388 align:middle line:84%
you finely chop it, and then
you add it to your soup,

00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
or you take your
kale, and you put it

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:84%
in a big blender, or
the Vitamix machine,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and then you puree it with
little the soup liquid,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you add
it to your soup.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So here's the point
I'm making here.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The learning point is that
the more you chop and blend up

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
these green vegetables
before you cook them,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the more you liberate those
beneficial anti cancer

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:90%
compounds.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They're still nutritious if you
cook them and then chop them

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.715 align:middle line:84%
or if you let blend them in the
soup after they've been cooked.

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But the secret
little tip here is

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
to chop them up is
fine as possible

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
first so they create
those compounds

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and then the heat of
the soup won't interfere

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
with the formation
of those compounds,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
because the enzyme in the
cruciferous vegetables

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
gets its fullest
activity to produce

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
those biological
anticancer compounds when

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:90%
the food is still raw.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So we went over the
kale, how to chop it.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
We went over finely
chopping watercress.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Parsley is not a
cruciferous vegetable.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Like there's some parsley here.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Like here's parsley
and here's parsley.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Parsley is not a
cruciferous vegetable,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.407 align:middle line:84%
but you still want to chop
it up fine for your soup.

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't want a puree it.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Leave it crunchy.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have some
other things here,

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
some other herbs we can
use to spice up the soup.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Like watercress spices
up the soup, too.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
Radishes and radish
tops are cruciferous.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
They give the
super great flavor.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:90%
And dill.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Dill is a wonderful vegetable
and a wonderful spice

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:90%
to add nutrients to your food.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.104 align:middle line:84%
What I do with dill is
I chop it up finely--

00:17:15.104 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I chop it up very finely.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't blend it, because I
want it to be floating around

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:90%
in that soup.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
A great vegetable
to add to your soup,

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and I always keep
some dill in the house

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
because I love to sprinkle
dill onto my squash dishes,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%
on baked potato dishes.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I love to use the dill
as a little flavoring

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to sprinkle over the food
and even to put in sandwiches

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
or in whole wheat pita
pockets, where you're

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
stuffing in maybe
some green vegetables,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
some shredded salad, some
avocado with a great dressing.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Dill's a wonderful thing to add.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're going
through these green vegetables,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and let's touch base
on an artichoke,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
because this really is one
of my favorite vegetables.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I can eat artichokes every
single night for dinner

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and be satisfied.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one of those
great vegetables that taste

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:90%
great with nothing on them.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.787 align:middle line:84%
Let me quickly show you
how to make an artichoke,

00:18:09.787 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people aren't
familiar with artichokes.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.703 align:middle line:84%
They're very easy
to cook, and they're

00:18:13.703 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:90%
delicious with nothing on them.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So you just pull off
some of the bottom stem,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:90%
the bottom pieces of the stem.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.958 align:middle line:84%
Preparing the artichoke,
just the very tip

00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of the bottom piece
I'm going to slice off.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then-- because the
whole stem is edible

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.512 align:middle line:90%
it's really delicious.

00:18:34.512 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to slice
through the center

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
of the artichoke with my knife.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Just watch this
for a second, OK?

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.078 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut right down
the artichoke because now

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that I've cut through the
center of the artichoke

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
with my knife, without, of
course, cutting my fingers,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
now the artichoke's going
to cook in under 15 minutes.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know how you know
when the artichoke gets done,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:84%
because I can take
one of these leaves,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and it rips right
off very easily

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
just by grabbing
it with the tongs

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and pulling up and
shaking it, the leaf

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.152 align:middle line:84%
will come off the artichoke
when the artichoke is cooked.

00:19:06.152 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you know it's
cooked, takes about 15 minutes.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
If you cook it this way,
it'll cook much faster,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:90%
and we take a small knife now--

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
let me find a smaller knife.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:90%
One second.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, now right in the
center of the artichoke

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
here is this like
peach fuzz material

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that's not really edible,
and this lip right

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
under the peach fuzz, if this is
called the choke or the center

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
of the artichoke, this
is the most tasty part

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and delicious part
of the artichoke.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
To prepare this
nice and easy, there

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
is a lip right at the
edge of that fuzzy

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
stuff, which I'm
going to cut deeply

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.608 align:middle line:90%
and right along that lip.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:90%
So give me a second here.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's cut this together, OK?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
my knife in there,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to cut
right along that lip.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I can kind of feel when I got
to the bottom of that lip.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I can take the
center of these leaves

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.438 align:middle line:84%
right here around that
fuzzy part of the artichoke.

00:20:12.438 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:90%
I didn't cut deep enough.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Let me cut a little
deeper, so I can

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
feel I'm getting to
the bottom of that lip.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the center
part of the artichoke

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
lift right out.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So now I lifted out the
center where this peach fuzz

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.547 align:middle line:90%
was-- you see the fuzzy part.

00:20:27.547 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:90%
This is not the good part.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:84%
This is not an edible
part of the artichoke.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And these small leaves
are like plastic

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and sticky are not
very good inedible.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So I cut them out of the
center of the artichoke.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So now when I put the
artichoke in the pot,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I steam it with this open
spot in the middle right,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and then these leaves
right above the center

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
of the artichoke, these little
baby leaves that get cooked,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
are the most delicious
and delectable part

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:90%
of that artichoke.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:90%
This gets soft.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
These little leaves get soft.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And the whole leaf is edible.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You can just put
this in your mouth

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and chew the whole leaf up.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.902 align:middle line:84%
And the center part
of the artichoke--

00:21:02.902 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and don't forget
these outer leaves

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:90%
pull right off once it's cooked.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And this center
point right here,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
which I'll just cut
those outer leaves off

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:90%
right now to show you.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then once the
artichoke is cooked,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:84%
you have this center
part of the artichoke,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
and the whole thing is edible.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So you eat all this
piece of the artichoke,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and you eat the whole stem, too.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
a green vegetable

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that's really solid, adds
some sustenance to your meal.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Eat a couple the
artichokes, it fills you up.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Great amount of fiber, great
amount of phytochemicals.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the outer leaves,
these heavy outer leaves,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:90%
if you notice they have--

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
they get soft, and the underside
and the bottom of the leaf

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
gets edible, becomes
soft and edible.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So you put it in your mouth,
or you could take a knife,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
you can hold it like this, and
put a knife down, and pull it

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
along the knife, and you'll
shave the edible part out

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:90%
of the artichoke.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Or you can put it in your
mouth and pull it down

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
with your teeth, and it's
soft, it tastes really good.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.498 align:middle line:84%
Tastes good now
even when it's raw.

00:22:14.498 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can eat this
part of the artichoke.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It's terrific.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So literally, you ate the
stem, you ate the leaves,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
you ate the center part, and
you dumped out that little fuzz

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, artichokes taste
pretty good raw, too.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But you know what I do
with a lot of artichokes,

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
we cut up a lot of this
part, and we bake them into--

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.863 align:middle line:84%
we take the artichokes
with oats and beans,

00:22:42.863 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and we make them into
burgers, make them

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
into types of vegetable loaves,
whole bunch of exciting recipes

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and where you can use
artichokes in your cooking.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables, in general,
offer strong protection

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
against cancer, not only the
green vegetables, but also

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
those low calorie vegetables
that are not green,

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
such as eggplant, mushrooms,
tomatoes, onions, garlic,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
peppers, water chestnuts,
spaghetti squash,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and hearts of palm.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
These colorful
vegetables not only

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
prevent chronic diseases,
such as high blood pressure

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease, they can
even help you reverse high blood

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:90%
pressure and heart disease.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you
desire to lose weight,

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
the more raw vegetables and
these low calorie vegetables

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:84%
you eat, the more
weight you will lose.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Then when you add low calorie
fruits, such as berries,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
oranges, grapefruit,
cherries, and pomegranates,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
you not only satisfy
your natural sweet tooth,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:84%
but you also protect yourself
against many cancers.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Berries, in particular, are an
excellent, nutrient dense, low

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
calorie source of vitamins
and phytochemicals

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that have anti aging and
brain protective effects.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Frozen fruits and
frozen vegetables

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
are a convenient substitute and
have a high nutritional value.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Frozen fruits are
great when making

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a healthy and delicious smoothie
or a cool creamy sorbet.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So eat two or three fresh fruits
with your breakfast and one

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:84%
or two other servings of
fruit with lunch or dinner.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Try lots of my vegetable
recipes and add a wide variety

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
of vegetables to your diet,
especially tomatoes, mushrooms,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
eggplant, peppers, and
onions, and continue

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to have a large salad
before dinner every night,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and chew it thoroughly.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the salad is the
main dish, so eat as much of it

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the nutritional
value of these fantastic foods

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.895 align:middle line:84%
that are great for our health
and make food taste great.

00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
things you want

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to add to soups and salads,
and people aren't aware,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, that mushrooms
have tremendous anti cancer

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
properties and are full of both
discovered and undiscovered

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:90%
nutrients.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But remember, mushrooms
are best cooked,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
because some of those little
those light amount of toxins

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in mushrooms are
actually dissipated when

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:90%
you heat or cook the mushrooms.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.908 align:middle line:84%
And also remember that there are
different types of mushrooms.

00:25:04.908 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:90%
There's white button mushrooms.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
They're small white mushrooms.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
There's these brown
mushrooms that

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
grow up and become portobellos
when they get bigger.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And these mushrooms are healthy,
so chop them up and add them

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to your soup.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here we have
some morel mushrooms.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
These are dried morel mushrooms
and porcini mushrooms.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.915 align:middle line:84%
You can buy them very
inexpensively dried

00:25:23.915 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and add them to your soups.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Just chop them up and
throw them in your soups.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
maitake mushrooms.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Maitake mushrooms
are very powerful,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:90%
very good for your health.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:90%
The whole mushroom is edible.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
You just rinse it off the stem,
the small pieces on the top.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You just chop them up and
when you get to the stem,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:90%
you chop it up smaller.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
blend the mushrooms

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
like you do with the greens or
some of the other vegetables.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
You want to have them be lumpy
and chunky in your soups,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:90%
just like this.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
these shiitake mushrooms.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
maitake mushrooms,

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and these are the
shiitake mushrooms.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:90%
They're a little tougher.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Even the stems of the
shiitake mushrooms

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.288 align:middle line:84%
are really rough,
rough and tough,

00:26:12.288 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:90%
but they're great in your soup.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They give a chewy feel,
so you cut them up--

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:84%
so cut up the mushroom,
and then slice up

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that stem of the shiitake
mushroom in very small pieces.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
They're like little
flavorful beans in the soup,

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:90%
absolutely delicious.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And here we have some
royal trumpet mushrooms.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And royal trumpet, they're
shaped like a trumpet,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the stem as you can
see is pure white,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and it can be chopped up and an
excellent flavor to your soups

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.377 align:middle line:90%
and vegetable dishes.

00:26:43.377 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:90%
And these are great.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
These mushrooms are
great when you saute them

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:84%
in garlic and onion
with your baby bok choy.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So bok choy and cabbage can
be sauteed in a little tomato

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:84%
sauce or tomato juice with
garlic, a little nutritional

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
yeast, little spices and
flavorings with the mushrooms

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:90%
makes a delicious side dish.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, what's a great
flavoring for vegetables,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of course, is sun
dried tomatoes.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So moving away
from mushrooms, we

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
put the fresh tomatoes,
which as you know,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
tomatoes protect you against
cancer, like prostate

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:90%
cancer and breast cancer.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They contain a carotenoid
called lycopene,

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and they also-- tomatoes also
contain a unique carbohydrate,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and this unique
carbohydrate in tomatoes

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to be protective
against unusual types

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, like breast
cancer, like cervical cancer,

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.770 align:middle line:90%
like ovarian cancer.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Tomatoes are a wonderful
nutritious food.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:50.000 align:middle line:84%
That special carbohydrate in
tomato with its anti cancer

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
effects, build up more
and get more absorbable

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
when you eat sun dried tomatoes
and you then rehydrate them.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So you buy these
sun dried tomatoes,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and what we do is we take
the sun dried tomatoes,

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and we rehydrate them
by soaking them in water

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
in a plastic container
in your fridge.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You rehydrate them,
and you take them out

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
after they've been
softened by rehydration.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you slice
them into small pieces.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So you slice these
tomatoes into small pieces,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and you have these sun dried
tomatoes that were hard,

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
softer and rehydrated,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can add
them to your salads.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You can sprinkle them on
your vegetable dishes.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You can throw sun dried
tomatoes, even not rehydrated,

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:90%
into the soups for cooking.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But sun dried tomatoes
rehydrated give you

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:84%
a large amount of these
special protective nutrients

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and a large amount of lycopene.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And they add a special gourmet
flavor to much of your dishes.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, now no vegetable
dish would reach

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:84%
its limit of
delectable perfection

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
without the use of
garlic and onion.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And the garlic and
onion family are

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:84%
very rich in flavonoids and
phenols, which also protect you

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:84%
against cancer
and heart disease.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They have anti-inflammatory
effects in the body.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They're very important
nutritious foods.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, here of
course at Whole Foods,

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we have white onion, yellow
onion, red onion, shallots.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have
leek, which is

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in the onion family,
scallions, and you

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.835 align:middle line:84%
can notice that leak
and scallions are

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
a green vegetable, and also,
they're in the onion family.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're very rich and
find all types of nutrients,

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as these special
phenols and flavonoids, so very

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:90%
powerful nutrient rich foods.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, don't forget, like the
green cruciferous vegetables,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
when you cut the onion, you
form a chemical reaction,

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:84%
because an enzyme is released,
and the release of the enzyme

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:84%
causes the sulfur
compounds to be formed.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the sulfur compounds
can get in your eyes

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and cause your eyes
to tear, and it

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:84%
causes actually sulfuric
acid in your eye

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.835 align:middle line:84%
when it hits the
wet of your eye,

00:30:05.835 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and that can cause burning of
your eyes, causing tearing.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So we want to show you
how to cut an onion

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to minimize hearing,
but to maximize

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the production of these
beneficial compounds that

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
prevent cancer, all right?

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So OK, don't forget
now the white onion

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is not as nutritious as the
yellow onion or the red onion.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.863 align:middle line:84%
So the red onion
and the yellow onion

00:30:24.863 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
are much more nutritious
from the white onion,

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
have twice as much
bioflavonoids and phenols

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:90%
in the colored onion.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And the onions with the most
bioflavonoids and phenols

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
are the little baby
onions, the shallots,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:84%
super healthy, high nutrient,
anti cancer foods here.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, the secret to
cutting an onion,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
not to have yourself tear,
is to make the onion cold

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
before you cut it, because
when it's at room temperature,

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.118 align:middle line:90%
it gives off more gas.

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do is
you want to refrigerate

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.077 align:middle line:90%
the onion for a while.

00:30:56.077 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Better yet, you only
have to drop the onion

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.692 align:middle line:84%
in the freezer for five
minutes before you cut it,

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and it won't give
off all that gas,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and you won't make
your eyes tear.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the root of
the onion right here,

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
the root part is the part which
has more biologic activity.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say,
cut the root out.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They say cut a circle around
the onion and remove that root,

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
so it won't make your
eyes tear as much.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling you
to do that, because we

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:90%
want those chemicals, right?

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:90%
We want those bioflavonoids.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:90%
We want the sulfur compounds.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to remove
the part of the onion that

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:90%
makes your eyes tear the most.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:90%
You want to eat it.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.403 align:middle line:84%
So you could put a fan to
blow the gas away from you

00:31:34.403 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:90%
as you're cutting the onion.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:90%
That works very well, too.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people can--
but the simplest way

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.935 align:middle line:84%
to do it is to cut the onion
with the root facing away

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
from you, of course, the part
where all the chemicals are

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
going to come out, and
also just to make the onion

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:90%
cold before you cut it.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So let's take this onion.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cut off the
bottom part right here.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.755 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cut
off the top part.

00:31:55.755 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a-- and I
didn't cause any tearing right

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:84%
now because it's
away from my body.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.693 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a little
slit on the side of the onion.

00:32:01.693 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
remove the outer skin.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Remove the outer
skin of the onion,

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%
and my onion's ready to go.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the question.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
The onion is ready to
go, didn't cause tearing.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Should I drop this
whole onion in a soup,

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:84%
cook it up, and then get
soft and mushy, throw it

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
in my blender to
give the soup flavor?

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.688 align:middle line:90%
Should I do that or not?

00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is no, you
don't really want to do that.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Because that will kill the
biological enzymes in the onion

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that cause these
compounds to be formed

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:90%
that fight against cancer.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you cut the onion
first before you put it

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
into the soup, you get 10 times
the cancer fighting activities.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the bottom
of the onion, right?

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the part where
most of the chemicals are.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to cut that onion.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to face it
away from my body.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to slice the
onion with the bottom part away

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:90%
from my body.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And if the onion was cold
before I cut it, of course,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it would create less tearing,
but I'm not that close to it,

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So make believe I cut
up the whole onion,

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and now I can slice it and add
it to my soup in little chunks.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Just this slicing of the onion
and cutting it up like that

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and then adding it to my soup.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:90%
See now it's raw, right?

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It's raw.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.780 align:middle line:84%
All those chemical reactions
occurring right now, right?

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget,
this white onion

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have as much sulfur as
the yellow or red onion does,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
but I'm OK.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not crying, am I?

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.428 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.428 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you want to cut
it and then add it to the soup,

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.013 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:33.013 --> 00:33:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Or you could take the onion
out-- you could take the onion

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and you just make
one or two slits,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
drop it in a food
processor or a blender,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
throw some cruciferous
vegetables in with it.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.308 align:middle line:84%
Ladle a little
liquid from the soup

00:33:44.308 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and turn on your blender or your
food processor, your Vitamix

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
machine, make it give off
that smell, create that gas.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.720 align:middle line:84%
That gas that's
being produced is

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
showing you're creating
great beneficial nutritious

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:90%
compounds, OK?

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So we went over
onions, scallions, too.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, you want
to chew them well.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You cut scallions that are
already grouped together.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You cut the bottom off.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You cut the top off
and the whole rest

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:90%
is edible for the soup.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to chop
this up smaller

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
or blend it before we
put it in the soup?

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Sure we do.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with a leek.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Now leek are a great
thing to add to your soup.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you quickly
how to make a leek, OK?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:90%
Here's a smaller one.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:84%
First thing we do to cook with
leek is we chop the bottom off.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Cut that bottom part right off.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, throw away the root.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Take the top piece of the
leek right where it's been cut

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.227 align:middle line:84%
and cut that part and
throw that away, too.

00:34:42.227 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Right now, here's
the part of the leek

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use, right?

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Very easy to make a leek.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The thing to remember
when cooking with a leek

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of leeks
have a lot of dirt inside.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So we take the leek, and
we make a slice right

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:90%
down the center of the leek.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I've cut the
leek into two pieces,

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can easily
unravel the leaf.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:90%
See the dirt in the leaf?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:90%
See that in there?

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
You want to unravel
the leek, because you

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.100 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to clean it
well, to remove the dirt.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
If you threw the leak
in whole in your soup,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:84%
you'd get a lot of
sand in your teeth.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So look, you see I'm unraveling
the leek, peeling it all open.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw this
in a big pot of water,

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in a big part of cold
water to be able to remove

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:90%
the dirt from the leek.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I take my leeks
that are clean now,

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
it's cut and cleaned, do
I dump them in the soup?

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.853 align:middle line:90%
First you want to chop them up.

00:35:33.853 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to chop them
up before you cook them.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.937 align:middle line:84%
Because those enzymes,
which are heat sensitive,

00:35:40.937 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to deaden them
with the heat of the soup.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.478 align:middle line:84%
You want them to be active
while you're cutting them.

00:35:45.478 --> 00:35:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
cutting this leek up,

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a
chemical reaction that's

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.520 align:middle line:90%
liberating those compounds.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Better yet, while it's raw--

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and once you put the onion
family into the soup,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the heat doesn't destroy
the beneficial compounds.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
See, the heat doesn't
destroy the compounds.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
It just prevents the enzymes
from forming the compounds.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty-- you
understand that?

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Really interesting stuff.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:90%
So let's go on.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:90%
We finished mushrooms.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:84%
We finished onions, the onion
family and tomatoes, right?

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to corn and
carrots, because likewise,

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
corn and carrots also contain
beneficial carotenoids

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
that have anti cancer effects.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's this unique ability
that we have in modern America

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:84%
with so much opportunity
of different foods,

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
we could mix together
tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms,

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:84%
onion family with the green
leafy cruciferous family

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what gives us that
total combination of nutrients.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That full spectrum of
anti cancer nutrients

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
give us the most
nutritional power

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.310 align:middle line:84%
to protect us against
those diseases.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So let's take some raw corn, OK?

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So raw corn, we're going
to split the raw corn down

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the middle, take a
look at this corn.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Yellow corn, white
corn, speckled corn.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.477 align:middle line:84%
And let's taste it raw, because
when we taste the corn raw,

00:37:14.477 --> 00:37:16.060 align:middle line:84%
we can tell how fresh
and sweet it is.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to eat a little corn.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.810 align:middle line:90%
This is really good.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'm going
to eat some more.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm hungry.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.438 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:25.438 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Corn is pretty good
raw. but you know

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:84%
what, now I know I want
to buy a lot of these corn

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:84%
today, because I know it's
sweet, I know it's fresh.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.242 align:middle line:84%
Instead of buying two or three,
I'm going to buy 24 of them,

00:37:37.242 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
because my kids will
eat them like candy.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%
My kids will eat them.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.273 align:middle line:84%
And you know what we'll do,
because the corn is so sweet

00:37:43.273 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
today, and because they
must've just picked it

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:90%
in the last day or two.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:84%
If they picked it last week,
it wouldn't be this sweet.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.640 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to do is
we're going to actually husk it

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:84%
in the store, because they have
a little garbage pail there,

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.040 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to
dirty up my kitchen.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I can take it here--

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Whole Foods is so good.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They put a garbage
pail out there.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We can husk the corn in
the store right here.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.325 align:middle line:84%
And I can pack up about
24 of these ears of corn

00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:84%
to take home with me,
and I want to cook them--

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:90%
I'll cook them all today.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:08.950 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.117 align:middle line:84%
If I let him sit in my
refrigerator for two or three

00:38:11.117 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:84%
days and lose their
freshness, they're

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:90%
going to lose that sweetness.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But if I cook them all up,
some we'll eat tonight,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and we'll store them
cold, so once they're

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
cooked, that they'll
keep their sweetness.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm giving you one other
little secret here, is that--

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
it's very important-- that
in corn is a special compound

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:90%
called resistant starch.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
It's higher in corn than in
most any other vegetable.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And that means the
resistant starch is enhanced

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.830 align:middle line:84%
when you put the corn
in the refrigerator,

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.435 align:middle line:84%
so when you took
the cooked corn,

00:38:43.435 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and you put in your
refrigerator to get cold,

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and you ate the cold
corn the next day,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
there's even more resistant
starch in the cold corn

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:90%
than there was in the hot corn.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And the resistant
starch is broken down

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.370 align:middle line:84%
by bacteria in the
colon, and the bacteria

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:84%
change that resistant starch
into a compound called

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
butyrate, which
fights colon cancer.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting, huh?

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And you don't absorb all the
calories from resistant starch,

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:90%
and it makes you lose weight.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, assume this
corn is now cooked.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Now that it's cooked, this
is what it can do with it.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I can take my knife,
and I can slice it down,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.170 align:middle line:84%
the cold cooked
corn down the edge.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And because the starch
became gummy from being cold,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the whole edge of the
corn will stick together,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:84%
instead of falling
apart like it is now.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You see how it's falling
apart into individual kernels?

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Once I cook it, make it cold,
and I cut it down that lip,

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
this lip of corn will
stay together in a sheet,

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and I could make sheets of
that corn to pack up in bags

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or to give to kids to snack
on or to make in special--

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to put in sandwiches and
things, stuff in pita.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So corn is a fun food.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:90%
All right, carrots.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Carrots also, they're
bundled together.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Keep them bundled.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:84%
If the string beans
come in a package

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
where they're all in a
line, keep them in line,

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:84%
because now they're
easier to cut can cut.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I can cut top off with
one slice of the knife.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I can cut the whole top off.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Then take the rubber band off.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, take the
top off, take the bottom of.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The last thing to do is take
the rubber band off, right?

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.138 align:middle line:90%
And you know what I could do?

00:40:18.138 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So now you're
going to wash them,

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.043 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to peel the
carrots you can just wash them.

00:40:23.043 --> 00:40:25.002 align:middle line:84%
One of my most favorite
thing to do the carrots

00:40:25.002 --> 00:40:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is to put them
through the juicer

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and add them to soups to
add flavor to the soups.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'll juice tomatoes.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I'll juice carrots.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when the
carrot juice comes out

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of the juicer, what
I'll do is I'll

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.730 align:middle line:84%
take the pulp that came
through the juicer,

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll compact it and put the damp
pulp back through the juicer

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:84%
again to get even
more juice out of it,

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:84%
so you get all those beneficial
carotenoids out of carrots.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, it's not
one food, one vegetable,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.140 align:middle line:84%
or one even type of
food that gives us

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:84%
the incredible nutrient power
to defend against disease.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the synergy, the symphonic
effect of all these nutrients

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.330 align:middle line:90%
put together in your body.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:90%
So bon appetit.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Have variety in your diet, and
enjoy these delicious fruits

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over some interesting
information and facts

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
about fruit, because fruit
are powerful foods that

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:90%
protect your health, too.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They're particularly
protective against the type

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:84%
of cancer called
squamous cell carcinomas.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In any case, some of my favorite
fruit, oranges, berries,

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
bananas, apples,
cherries-- just love fruit.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, you can mix
fruit in salads and mix fruit

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.500 align:middle line:84%
in vegetable dishes, too,
to add interesting flavors.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Like take a plantation.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
A plantation is one of these big
bananas that has a more tougher

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:84%
consistency, and the
toughness, the fact

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't fall apart
as easily with cooking

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
makes it a great addition
to vegetable dishes.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So slice up that bok choy,
that cabbage, those tomatoes,

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:90%
and cut up--

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and you know, I like
to buy a plantain that

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look bruised,
like this one,

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and then leave it in my
house til it gets yellow.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And I love plantains.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I even love them when they
get really ripe looking

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and a little soft.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll slice them
down on both sides,

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.610 align:middle line:84%
peel them back, and eat
them raw like a banana.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.500 align:middle line:90%
They're really delicious.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But because they're
tougher than the banana,

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you can slice them up,
they won't fall apart.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:90%
They'll keep their consistency.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And now I can use these chopped
plantains in my vegetable dish,

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and they won't get all crumbly.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll stay a little
banana flavoring.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:90%
They're delicious.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can wok them,
and you can bake them.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:84%
You can even bake them
when you're baking things

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.050 align:middle line:84%
like squash, butternut
and acorn squash,

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and you put a little
apricot, raisin, walnuts,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and chopped plantain in with
the squash when it's cooking.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.505 align:middle line:84%
Then you get it all out,
you mix it together,

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:55.937 align:middle line:90%
absolutely delicious.

00:42:55.937 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
move on from bananas.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.462 align:middle line:84%
And also when you buy
bananas, everybody

00:42:59.462 --> 00:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
knows to buy the bananas
when they're not ripe,

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:90%
so they don't get bruised.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But as they start to ripen,
and you're eating them,

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.920 align:middle line:90%
don't let them over ripen.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we
take the bananas

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.543 align:middle line:84%
when they start to get ripe, and
we have too many ripe bananas

00:43:13.543 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
in the house, is we peel them
and we peel the ripe bananas,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.870 align:middle line:84%
put them in plastic bags,
and put them in our freezer.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So we always have a good stock
of bananas that are ripe,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that are then frozen,
which then you

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
can slice to make
banana ice cream out of

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and banana sorbets and special
kind of treats and custards.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The greatest thing to do is just
to take a little frozen banana

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:84%
out of your refrigerator,
and you just slice it up,

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:84%
throw it in a blender
or food processor,

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
with a little soy
milk, a little hemp

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
milk, a little almond milk,
throw a couple cups of berries

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.360 align:middle line:84%
in there, throw a few dates in
there, throw a little vanilla,

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:84%
make all types of flavorings
ice creams and sorbets

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and homemade pies with nut
bases that make delicious

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:84%
treats from those
frozen bananas.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So you never have to worry
about throwing out a banana.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You freeze them before
they get to ripe.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's move on to mangoes.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I love mangoes.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And this store,
this is fantastic,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:90%
we got these tropical mangoes.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We have the Haitian
mangoes, my favorite mango.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.390 align:middle line:84%
You want to buy your mango,
of course, when it's firm,

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and let it soften just
so it's a little soft.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.950 align:middle line:84%
If it gets too
soft, it can start

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to get overripe and
start to ferment.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Are you guys familiar with
how to cook and eat a mango?

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
different ways to do it.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to
do it quickly is

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I take that pit that runs up
and down and is very narrow,

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and I slice the mango
right alongside the center.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So I make two melon like
halves, which I can then eat.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.480 align:middle line:84%
There's different
ways to do this.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
With a nice mango like this,
I can just take a spoon

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and eat it with a spoon right
out the mango like this.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have a
spoon with me, I'll

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:84%
just score the base of
a mango with a knife,

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:84%
being careful not to
cut through to my hand.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:90%
See, no blood.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just cut it through,
score it close to the skin.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:84%
You could feel the
skin with the knife.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And now I can just pop the
mango inside out and just

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:90%
eat it like this.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Great mango.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
center part-- don't

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
want to miss the
part next to the pit.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Slice the edge of the pit and
peel back the edge like this.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And then once you took
the skin off the pit,

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I can then slice it
with a knife, right?

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I can slice the edges off around
the pit like this with a knife,

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
put them in my salad
or eat it plain,

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:84%
or I can slice around
both sides, and cut it--

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or I could just put
the pit in my mouth

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and suck the juices out
right along the pit, one

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:90%
of my most favorite foods.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they'll be one of
your most favorite foods, too.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Mangoes, too, can be added to
salads and vegetable dishes.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You can cook up vegetables
with mango and banana,

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.680 align:middle line:90%
terrific tropical treat.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's move on.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Avocado.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we want to eat
less oil and less for those

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.470 align:middle line:84%
fats coming from animal products
and prepared products and more

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:90%
fat from natural whole foods.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's an
avocado, and this is

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:84%
a Hass avocado, grown usually
in California or Mexico.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And these avocados, you buy
them green, and they're hard,

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
edible like this.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Just like a banana, you
want to wait till it ripens.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And as the avocado
starts to darken

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and starts to get a little
bit more rich color,

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that's when it's
ripe and edible.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this avocado
right here is too ripe.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:33.913 align:middle line:84%
I would not buy this
avocado probably,

00:46:33.913 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:84%
because it's too high of a
probability of it getting

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.890 align:middle line:84%
bruised or damaged in bringing
it from the store in all

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.090 align:middle line:90%
the stuff in the bag.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd prefer to buy it with
a little mixture of green

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and just a slight degree
of darkness into it

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and let it ripen in my house.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I also like them better when
they're not quite so soft.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And what you do with the avocado
is when they start to get--

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:90%
this is very hard, right?

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
When they start to just get
a little bit of pressure

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.633 align:middle line:84%
to this, so you can feel
a little bit of softness,

00:47:00.633 --> 00:47:02.990 align:middle line:84%
just like the banana,
don't leave it out there,

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:06.500 align:middle line:84%
outside of the refrigerator
so it ripens too much.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Take the avocado and put
it in your refrigerator,

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:84%
not your freezer
like the banana,

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.590 align:middle line:84%
just in the
refrigerator, and that

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:84%
will halt the ripening
process and keep that

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:84%
in the stage of the avocado
that you can enjoy the best.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with papaya.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.585 align:middle line:84%
Papaya is a great food,
and these large papayas

00:47:24.585 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:90%
are really delicious.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
They're low in calories,
high in nutrients.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And you want to buy a
little greener like this.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's firm, so
it won't bruise up.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And then wait till it starts to
get a little more yellow tinge.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You see how this papaya is
starting to ripen, starting

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to just get a
little yellow in it?

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And this one has
more yellow in it.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:84%
As it yellows, it gets a little
more that it gets softer,

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and this probably is
good to eat right now.

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So we cut the papaya in half.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.920 align:middle line:84%
We cut the tip off,
cut it down the middle,

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and then we can see those--

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.000 align:middle line:90%
the black seeds.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is obviously
a nice ripe papaya.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And we can take a spoon,
which I don't have right now,

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can take the spoon and
just fillet out the center part

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:84%
here, removing the
seeds without removing

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.350 align:middle line:90%
too much of the papaya.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.080 align:middle line:84%
You remove those
seeds with a spoon.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
could use a soft knife,

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.630 align:middle line:84%
like a butter knife, to get down
and get the rest of those seeds

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:24.440 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your
papaya ready to scoop out

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
with a spoon, or you
could slice it in strips,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:90%
like I'm doing right now.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And once it's sliced
in strips, you

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.500 align:middle line:84%
can cut it down right along
the edge like a melon,

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.970 align:middle line:84%
removing the skin, and slicing
it up to put in your salads

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:42.628 align:middle line:90%
or to add your dishes.

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, everybody knows how
to peel an orange, right?

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You just-- usually score
the top of the orange juice,

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:84%
so you don't hurt your finger
getting it in to start it.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.613 align:middle line:90%
That's probably easier.

00:48:52.613 --> 00:48:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I do
whenever I peel an orange

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is remove the top
portion, and then I

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.240 align:middle line:84%
go around in a circular
motion, around the outside

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.830 align:middle line:90%
of the orange, right?

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:84%
This one was cut already, so
it has a little cut in it,

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:05.060 align:middle line:90%
so it's not peeling as easy.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And then once I go around
the outside of the orange,

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I work my way, my
finger underneath,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.840 align:middle line:84%
my thumb underneath right
towards the center piece

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.115 align:middle line:84%
to pull out that center stem,
and your orange is peeled.

00:49:15.115 --> 00:49:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So that one was
cut a little bit.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So you can start the orange--

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you again.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You start the orange to
make an easy peeled orange.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.408 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you can
juice oranges, too.

00:49:23.408 --> 00:49:24.950 align:middle line:84%
When you juice the
oranges, cut right

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
through the center that way,
not through the stem part.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, just start the
orange, go right to this pit,

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and move around the outside
of the orange circular,

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.150 align:middle line:90%
as you turn the orange.

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get close
to the bottom like this,

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.480 align:middle line:84%
you're getting close to
the bottom of the orange,

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.480 align:middle line:84%
you reach your thumb towards
that stem, pull out the stem,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and the orange is peeled
pretty quickly and easily.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Got that?

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, let's last
touch on melons.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:84%
This melon's very
smooth, white, and green.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The bottom part doesn't
give to the thumb,

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.440 align:middle line:90%
not really ripe enough.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It'll be OK if I let it
ripen for a while my house.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer to look
for a sweeter melon,

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell when
I pick out the melon,

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.790 align:middle line:84%
it starts to have that
little film over it.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:13.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it's not as smooth,

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.250 align:middle line:90%
that little bit of roughness.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You can almost start to
smell the sweetness in it,

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of an orange
tinge some time in the base.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And when press on the base
of the melon, it gives.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:84%
My finger is going
in a little bit here.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:84%
This one will
ripen much quicker,

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and it will probably be
sweeter because the melon is

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
what was picked a little
bit closer to a riper stage.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Beans and legumes are among
the world's most healthy foods.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.880 align:middle line:84%
They stabilize blood sugar,
blunt you desire for sweets,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and prevent mid
afternoon food cravings.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Dried beans are you most
economical, high nutrient food.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Beans are a wonderful way
to add high quality plant

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:84%
protein to your
diet, and they're

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.520 align:middle line:84%
high in iron, B
vitamins, and fiber.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're also so versatile
that they can add delicious

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:90%
variety to many dishes.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, eating less animal
protein and more plant protein

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.750 align:middle line:84%
from greens, beans,
nuts and seeds,

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.420 align:middle line:84%
are the key to a long
disease free life.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Animal protein
raises the hormone

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.960 align:middle line:84%
in the body called IGF-1, or
insulin like growth factor 1,

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.210 align:middle line:84%
which promotes breast
and prostate cancer,

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.130 align:middle line:90%
while beans do the opposite.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Scientific research studies
indicate that eating beans

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:26.830 align:middle line:90%
is linked to a longer lifespan.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.350 align:middle line:84%
There are so many beans to
choose from and so many ways

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.610 align:middle line:90%
to prepare them.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.000 align:middle line:84%
You can soak dried beans in
water overnight in a glass jar

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and then drain and rinse
them daily until they sprout.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Then store the sprouts in the
fridge and use them in salads.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Unsalted canned beans, available
in most health food stores,

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:48.160 align:middle line:84%
are also great in salads, or you
can cook dried beans in water

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and some seasonings on a low
flame for an hour until soft

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and save them for use in salads
and cooked vegetable dishes.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But the easiest
way to make beans

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is to add the dried beans
directly to your soups

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.150 align:middle line:90%
when you're cooking them.

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people have
trouble digesting beans.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you chew
them very well.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
problem with beans,

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:84%
eat a smaller amount so
you do not have discomfort.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you eat a small
amount regularly and chew them

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.870 align:middle line:84%
very well, over time
your body learns

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.610 align:middle line:84%
how to digest them
better, and people

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.190 align:middle line:84%
find they can eat more of
them without difficulty.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The smaller beans, like lentils,
adzuki beans, mung beans,

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and peas digest most easily.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:35.650 align:middle line:84%
The pinto, kidney, navy, black
eyed peas, garbanzo, soy beans,

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.250 align:middle line:84%
black beans are a
little harder to digest.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So eat beans daily in a
vegetable soup, in a salad,

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.790 align:middle line:84%
or as an ingredient
in a dip or main dish.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Eat greens, eat the
non starchy vegetable,

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.470 align:middle line:84%
such as mushrooms, peppers,
eggplant, and tomatoes.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Eat your fruit every day, and
also try to eat some beans.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.350 align:middle line:84%
There are some amazing
recipes with beans in my books

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:90%
and on my website.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You may want to try a great bean
and mushroom burger and even

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:84%
a healthy chocolate
bar made from blending

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:84%
black beans with almond butter
dates and unsweetened cocoa

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.840 align:middle line:90%
powder.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.290 align:middle line:84%
High fat plant foods contain
the essential fatty acids

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that your body needs.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Keep lots of raw nuts
and seeds on hand.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Nuts and seeds pack a
powerful, nutritional punch,

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and they satisfy hunger
better than oils,

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:84%
because they're rich in
fiber and critical nutrients.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.500 align:middle line:84%
They not only have one
quarter of the calories

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
compared to an
equal amount of oil,

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:32.140 align:middle line:84%
but they also contain fibers,
called sterols and stanols that

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:84%
do not get absorbed into
the body and bind fat

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.720 align:middle line:84%
into the digestive tract,
making all the calories

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.910 align:middle line:90%
not biologically available.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly, their
consumption is linked

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to weight loss not weight gain.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.780 align:middle line:84%
People who eat
seeds and nuts daily

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.290 align:middle line:84%
have a 60% lower risk
of fatal heart disease,

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and in the scientific
studies, they

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.920 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate reduced
risk of death

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.860 align:middle line:84%
from all causes and
increased lifespan.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So remember, not all
fatty foods are unhealthy.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:02.350 align:middle line:84%
The fats and seeds in
nuts are very different

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
from refined oils, saturated
fats, and trans fats,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.230 align:middle line:90%
fats to avoid.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:84%
A diet that does not contain
some seeds or nuts in fact

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is placing yourself
in needless risk.

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Only eat raw and
unsalted nuts and seeds

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and avoid those that are
assaulted and roasted.

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:22.690 align:middle line:84%
A tablespoon of ground
flax seeds, hemp seeds,

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
or other seeds can supply
those hard to find omega

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.250 align:middle line:84%
3 fats that protect
against diabetes,

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.310 align:middle line:90%
heart disease, and cancer.

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Seeds are also rich in lignins,
a type of fiber associated

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.000 align:middle line:84%
with a reduced risk of both
breast cancer and prostate

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.240 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.860 align:middle line:84%
In addition, seeds are a good
source of iron, zinc, calcium,

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:84%
potassium, magnesium,
vitamin E, and folate.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.918 align:middle line:84%
Most people think olive
oil is very healthful

00:54:49.918 --> 00:54:52.210 align:middle line:84%
given the often mentioned
benefits of the Mediterranean

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:53.050 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But olive oil, like
all other oils,

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.720 align:middle line:90%
has 120 calories per tablespoon.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And those calories
can add up fast.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Look, it's better to use olive
oil than butter or margarine,

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.370 align:middle line:84%
but olive oil can easily
sanitize your attempts

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to achieve a normal weight.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And oil does not contain
the nutrients, fiber,

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and phytonutrients that are
found in nuts and seeds.

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The traditional
Mediterranean diet

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:84%
is rich in fruits,
vegetables, and beans.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But the Mediterranean
people of past years

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.830 align:middle line:84%
ate some olive oil for
sure, but they also

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:26.080 align:middle line:84%
worked hard in fields with
a heavy plow and digging

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and planting, burning
the calories off.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, Mediterranean people
are overweight just like us.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They still eat
lots of olive oil,

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.920 align:middle line:84%
but their consumption of
fruits and vegetables and beans

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.150 align:middle line:90%
is way down.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Meat and cheese
consumption has risen,

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and the physical activity
level has plummeted.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to emulate the
most fattening and unhealthy

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:84%
part of the Mediterranean
diet, just because there are

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.230 align:middle line:90%
some other redeeming qualities.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.122 align:middle line:84%
Now, healthy salads
are definitely

00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:54.580 align:middle line:84%
a way of life for people who
want to lose weight or improve

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.450 align:middle line:90%
their health.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But many of the
benefits of the salad

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.680 align:middle line:84%
could be lost when you
put those three or four

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.440 align:middle line:84%
tablespoons of an oily
dressing on top, which

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.860 align:middle line:84%
means people are adding
over 400 calories of oil

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.172 align:middle line:84%
to 50 calories of
raw vegetables.

00:56:08.172 --> 00:56:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You might just as well
drink the dressing

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.380 align:middle line:84%
straight from the bottle
and forget the vegetables.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So the point is be
careful with oil.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Those calories can add
up fast and sabotage

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:19.990 align:middle line:84%
your good intentions
to drop a few pounds.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But the main other reason
to cut back on olive oil,

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.570 align:middle line:84%
besides the calories, is the
powerful heart protection

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you get when you eat more seeds
and nuts as your source of fat.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.440 align:middle line:84%
When you blend nuts and
seeds into dressings

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.440 align:middle line:84%
with a little flavored vinegars,
little fruit or tomato sauce,

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.500 align:middle line:84%
you receive dramatic
health benefits.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, raw nuts and seeds
are rich in critical nutrients

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and fibers and have only
a quarter of the calories

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.380 align:middle line:90%
of an equal amount of oil.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Even though raw nuts
and seeds are healthful,

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:52.480 align:middle line:84%
they still should be eaten
in limited quantities,

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.550 align:middle line:84%
because unless you're
slim and athletic,

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:84%
do not exceed two ounces
of raw nuts and seeds

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.900 align:middle line:84%
daily, because
nuts and seeds have

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.930 align:middle line:90%
about 175 calories per ounce.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Certainly start to cut
back on all oils, including

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:07.720 align:middle line:84%
olive oil, because
it's really fattening,

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and be careful not to exceed one
tablespoon of olive oil a day.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Even better, cut back
your oil even more

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and try water
sauteeing and using

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.000 align:middle line:84%
nuts and seeds blended with
fruits, tomatoes, vinegars,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and seasonings instead of
oil in your salad dressings.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Try some of my delicious salad
dressing recipes that use

00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.690 align:middle line:90%
nuts and seeds instead of oil.

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Whole grains have been a
central part of the human diet

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.070 align:middle line:90%
since early civilization.

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Human species and
hunter gatherers

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
settle down into
farming communities

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.060 align:middle line:84%
where they were able
to cultivate crops.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.940 align:middle line:84%
In the Americas, corn
was a staple grain.

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.130 align:middle line:90%
In India and Asia, it was rice.

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.050 align:middle line:90%
In Africa, people ate sorghum.

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle East, they
used flatbread, tabouli,

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and couscous.

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:54.130 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, corn, millet
wheat, rice, and pasta.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:56.220 align:middle line:84%
In Scotland, oats
were the staple food.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.653 align:middle line:84%
And in Russia, they had
buckwheat and kasha.

00:57:58.653 --> 00:58:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So remember, there
is a difference

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:03.510 align:middle line:84%
between whole grains, such as
buckwheat, oats, and wild rice

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and the many overly processed
whole grain cereals, which

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.230 align:middle line:84%
are so overly cooked
that they've lost

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.060 align:middle line:90%
most of the nutritional value.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The cardboard box they're
packaged in likely

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.180 align:middle line:90%
has more nutrients in it.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those refined
foods are often

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.000 align:middle line:84%
dry baked to make
them crisp, which

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.310 align:middle line:84%
results in the formation
of toxic compounds,

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:22.750 align:middle line:90%
such as acrylamides.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So not only do these
grains have to be

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:27.520 align:middle line:84%
whole grains and not refined,
but the way they are prepared

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.110 align:middle line:90%
matters.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about
achieving dramatic enhancements

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.910 align:middle line:84%
in longevity,
whole grains do not

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.580 align:middle line:84%
contain enough cancer
fighting micronutrients

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to be the major source
of calories in your diet.

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they do not show
the powerful protection

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.910 align:middle line:84%
against cancer
and other diseases

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that as apparent in scientific
studies of vegetables, beans,

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.880 align:middle line:90%
raw nuts, and seeds.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.340 align:middle line:84%
When eating grains,
try soaking, sprouting,

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.380 align:middle line:84%
or cooking your grains
in water instead

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.800 align:middle line:84%
of eating precooked cereals
or baked flour products.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, steel cut
oats and wild rices

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.820 align:middle line:90%
are healthy grain choices.

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember, don't fall
for the trick thinking

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole grain when
the ingredient says

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.920 align:middle line:84%
wheat flour or
organic wheat flour,

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.660 align:middle line:90%
which just means white flour.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It must say 100% whole
wheat or whole grain.

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can be sure it's
largely made of white flour.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So my recommendations are
to limit grain consumption

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to about one serving per day,
perhaps as a water cooked

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:84%
breakfast cereal
with fruits and nuts

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.030 align:middle line:90%
or as the dinner side dish.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And you have gluten
sensitivities,

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.670 align:middle line:84%
you can still
enjoy whole grains,

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:84%
such as quinoa, millet,
brown and wild rice.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over some of the
benefits of these incredibly

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:39.460 align:middle line:90%
interesting foods.

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some beans first, OK?

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Here we have adzuki beans.

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They're very like
red kidney beans,

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but they're smaller, so
they cook faster in a dish

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and get soft faster.

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And beans are a wonder
food, a wonder superfood.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They're so interesting,
because they've been

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.890 align:middle line:90%
linked in a scientific study--

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.710 align:middle line:84%
they've been linked
to enhance longevity.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're elderly, and you
eat beans on a regular basis,

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.030 align:middle line:84%
you live longer, and they have
specially protective effects

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.620 align:middle line:90%
against colon cancer.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.870 align:middle line:90%
This is how they work.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a bean,
not all the bean

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
gets digested fast, because
there are different types

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.130 align:middle line:90%
of starch in a bean.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Some get digested much slowly.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.970 align:middle line:84%
There's something called slowly
digestible starch in beans,

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and the body breaks
it down very slowly

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
so it keeps your blood
glucose stable for hours

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and takes away your hunger.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
There's also something in a
bean called resistant starch.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, resistant starch

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even get digested
in the intestines.

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the colon
and gets broken down

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
by bacteria in the
large intestines.

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
When those bacteria
break down the bean,

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they create short
chain fatty acid.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They break down the
resistant starch,

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and they create short
chain fatty acids.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the short chain
fatty acids produced

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
by the bacteria in the colon
feed back to the liver,

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and they inhibit glycolysis,
which means they slow down

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the use of glucose by
the body, which means,

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
again, you're not as hungry,
and you need less calories,

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:20.620 align:middle line:90%
and they make you burn more fat.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So let me say that again.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
When beans slow down glycolysis
and promote lipolysis,

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
it makes you burn fat,
makes you lose weight.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.932 align:middle line:84%
They take away your
hunger, and you're not--

01:01:32.932 --> 01:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to eat
less food, because they

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:37.110 align:middle line:90%
make you feel so satiated.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, when you
look at a cup of beans,

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.492 align:middle line:84%
and it says 200 calories
a cup, keep in mind

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of those
starch calories

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.680 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to get digested.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going to pass
down to the colon

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and be broken down by
the bacteria there.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's really not
200 calories a cup.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They give you this sensation,
the feedback to your brain,

01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and your nervous system
that you ate 200 calories.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, over that
next digestive period

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
of a few hours,
you're only going

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to digest about
150 those calories.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
feedback of causing

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.340 align:middle line:84%
you to increase your metabolism
and burn more fat the day

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
you eat them and
even the next day.

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So here are the important
points when you eat beans.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The important points are,
eat a variety of beans.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Especially eat the dark beans,
like navy beans, black beans,

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
red kidney beans, cannoli beans.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Eat the variety of colors.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget the lentils, both
the green, the dark lentils,

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:32.490 align:middle line:90%
and the brown lentils.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.410 align:middle line:90%
They're all excellent foods.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Split peas are also full of
resistant starch and very

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
healthy foods for
you to eat, always

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.020 align:middle line:90%
great to add to your soups.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are dried beans.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The dried beans when
soaked and cooked

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
have a higher amount
of resistant starch

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.400 align:middle line:90%
compared to canned beans.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So dried beans were
less expensive,

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're also better for you
to make your own bean dishes.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.967 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is we soak
the beans overnight.

01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Next day we cook them up with
a little garlic and onion,

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you save them cold,
cooked in the refrigerator,

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
so you can spoon
them onto your salads

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and spoon them onto
your vegetable dishes,

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
or you can put them
dried as is and cook them

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.600 align:middle line:90%
right in your soups.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.790 align:middle line:84%
All right, and the last
thing is with beans

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is don't forget is that if you
have trouble digesting beans,

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
they cause a lot of gas, that
means you haven't been eating

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.740 align:middle line:90%
them regularly.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So you get rid of that
excessive gas production

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
by eating a small amount
of beans twice a day.

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
As you eat the beans
on a regular basis,

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
a small amount with lunch and
a small amount with dinner,

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
your body builds
up the bacteria,

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
it gets used to digesting
them, and you no longer

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.710 align:middle line:90%
produce so much gas.

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So the beans are like a fuel
for those beneficial bacteria

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and the digestive
tract that are also

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
important for your good health,
because nuts and seeds are

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.507 align:middle line:90%
another superfood.

01:03:55.507 --> 01:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole
reason I want people

01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
eat less oil in their diet
is so they can get that room

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to put more calories from nuts
and seeds, like walnuts, Brazil

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
nuts, pistachio nuts,
an incredible superfood.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
See that they're green, full
of bioflavonoids and plant

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%
sterols.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the secret
here about nuts and seeds.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Because nuts and seeds have
been shown in scientific studies

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to have a dramatic effect
at preventing heart attacks,

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.870 align:middle line:84%
preventing cancer, and
halting sudden cardiac death.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, sudden cardiac death
is not a heart attack.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Sudden cardiac death is caused
by an irregular heartbeat.

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying that
that nuts and seeds have

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
an antiarrhythmic effect
to stabilize the heart

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
rhythm, a super important food
for your overall good health.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.660 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We put nuts and seeds in
our salads, for example.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
We make dips out of
them for vegetables.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
a hummus dip made

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
with sesame seeds, a
little garlic and scallions

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and horseradish, maybe with
a little bit of chickpeas

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
mixed in, and maybe
bake up an eggplant

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and make a dish with eggplant
hummus mixed in, with eggplant

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and the chickpeas
and the sesame seeds

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and grind it all up together.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You can make delicious
tasting dips and sauces.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Here we have that we got
right here in Whole Foods,

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
some ground hemp seed,
another superfood.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The flax seeds, the hemp
seeds, the sesame seeds,

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
the sunflower seeds are all
rich in the whole spectrum

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
of fatty acids, both
omega 3 and omega 6 fats

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
that are so good for your body.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they contain lignins that
prevent cancer, especially

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
breast cancer,
and they prevent--

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
and they have sterols.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Nuts and seeds so your
richest source of sterols.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, sterols lower cholesterol.

01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we make actually
vitamin supplements that

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
are made from sterols so people
with high cholesterol levels,

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
so they bind the
cholesterol in the gut

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and make your body
get rid of them.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's some new
findings about plant sterols

01:05:56.630 --> 01:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
in the last year, and
that is that plant sterols

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.492 align:middle line:84%
have dramatic effects at
protecting against cancer.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Let me say that one more time
because it's super important.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We're saying that the sterols
and the phytonutrients in nuts

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and seeds don't only
protect your heart.

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't only lower
your cholesterol.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't only add
soluble and insoluble fiber

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to the bulk of your stool and
protect against colon cancer.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They also have dramatic effects
against all types of cancers,

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
because plant sterols
have tremendously powerful

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.190 align:middle line:90%
anti cancer effects.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So nuts and seeds are superfoods
and without them in your diet,

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
you're just not
eating a healthy diet.

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's move
on to whole grains.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Whole grains now, there's
something important

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to know
about whole grains,

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.390 align:middle line:90%
because they're healthy, too.

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
It's that you have
to eat whole grains

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible intact.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
intact whole grains,

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because the more finely
you grind the grain,

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
it increases glycemic index, and
the more unhealthy it becomes.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we
don't want people

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%
eating products in white flour.

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
That's like eating sugar, high
glycemic index, no nutrients,

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.300 align:middle line:90%
like eating a candy bar.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Make sure when you're buying
breads and products made

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
from flour, if it says wheat
flour, that's not healthy.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
That's a trick to make you
think it's whole wheat flour.

01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It has to say those three
words, whole wheat flour,

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
not just wheat flour, because
they can call white flour wheat

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
flour.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So if the first ingredient
isn't whole wheat flour,

01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:31.810 align:middle line:90%
don't buy it.

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be the
first ingredient.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.840 align:middle line:84%
All right, even better,
flour still is not

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
as healthy as an intact grain.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy a
bread that's made

01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
with sprouted grains
or intact grains

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
or partially ground grains,
it's even healthier.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, here's
like oat flour is not

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.150 align:middle line:90%
as healthy as oatmeal.

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:55.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not as ground up as much.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Oatmeal is not quite as
healthy as steel cut oats,

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
because steel cut outs
are the whole oat cut.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not as ground up,
or it's not as slivered

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.400 align:middle line:84%
down as thin as oatmeal,
both healthy foods,

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
but steel cut oats has a lower
glycemic index and more zinc.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a healthier food.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's whole wheat berries.

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:20.109 align:middle line:84%
This is what they grind
up to make flour from.

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:22.359 align:middle line:84%
You can actually cook
with whole wheat berries

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and add it to a vegetable dish.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's healthier in the
berry form and not

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in the wheat form and
still a very healthy food.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.609 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
you could do, you

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:32.920 align:middle line:84%
could take these
whole wheat berries,

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can partially grind
them in your food processor

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
or your Vitamix machine, and
you can partially ground them

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
so they're not as ground down
so much as the thin flour

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
they make out of bread,
and you could bake

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
your own healthier bread
with carrots, with zucchini,

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:51.160 align:middle line:84%
with beets, with harshly
ground whole grains,

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.899 align:middle line:84%
with raisin and
apple and cinnamon.

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:57.069 align:middle line:84%
You can make delicious tasting
whole grains in your own house

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:58.720 align:middle line:90%
by using whole grains.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Another great whole
grain is quinoa,

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.189 align:middle line:90%
because quinoa is never ground.

01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a small grain.

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:09.189 align:middle line:84%
It has a pasta like flavor, very
soft and chewy, but delicious

01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to mix in vegetable dishes.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.168 align:middle line:84%
And of course, brown
rice and wild rice,

01:09:15.168 --> 01:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and if you want to make
it more nutritious,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
get more of the black and
wild rice in the blend,

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.899 align:middle line:84%
because they have more
phytonutrients and more

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:25.779 align:middle line:90%
resistant starch.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.080 align:middle line:90%
We talked about corn earlier.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.609 align:middle line:84%
Popcorn is a whole
grain, not talking here

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:32.649 align:middle line:90%
about eating corn flour.

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You can get a kind of
coarse kind of corn meal

01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:39.479 align:middle line:84%
that's better for
you than corn flour,

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's more
coarse, and you

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:41.707 align:middle line:84%
can make porridges
and cereals out

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of that and vegetable dishes
out of that, like polenta.

01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And you could also make
dishes with popcorn

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
or just have popcorn as a snack.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
fry it up in oil,

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.109 align:middle line:90%
but you can use an air popper.

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
You could sprinkle
some nutritional yeast

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and some seasonings on top.

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:58.100 align:middle line:90%
You even put a little bit of--

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
take a little water and a
little bit of olive oil,

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:02.160 align:middle line:84%
shake it together
in a spray bottle

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and spray it on the
popcorn, sprinkle

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
some nutritional
seasonings, and you

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
have a great wholesome
treat for your kids.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
All right, so to wrap
this up, remember,

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
the key to excellent
health is eating

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the majority of your diet
from a whole nutrient plant

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
foods, fruits, vegetables,
beans, a lot of beans,

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
big assortment of nuts and
seeds, especially seeds,

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and don't forget the
sesame seeds have

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
more sterols than any
other food, any other seed.

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And sterols protect
against cancer.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So you want to use a lot
of unhulled sesame seeds.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And unhulled sesame
seeds have more calcium

01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:42.605 align:middle line:84%
than any other food,
much more even than milk.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So you want to blend up
those unhulled sesame seeds

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:46.500 align:middle line:90%
into dressings and sauces.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, whole
grains, especially when

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
they're not finely ground,
and use them in your cooking,

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and not just to make
pastries out of.

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
You can make great
tasting dishes out of them

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that are still
wholesome and healthy.

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Since fish is generally low
in saturated fat and high

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in beneficial omega 3 fats, many
consider it an important part

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.420 align:middle line:90%
of a healthy diet.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
My message is that you still
have to be careful eating fish

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's one of the
most polluted foods we eat.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
In spite of the presence
of valuable omega

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
3 fatty acids called EPA and
DHA, all fish and shellfish

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
contains some mercury
and other pollutants.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
When we eat fish, we have to
choose the species that are

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
cleaner and have less mercury.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Larger fish, who have
lived the longest,

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
have the highest
levels of mercury

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
because they have had more
time to accumulate it.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They may also accumulate it from
all the smaller fish they've

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
eaten, similar to the
way we accumulate mercury

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in our tissues from
the fish we eat.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
If you eat fish
regularly, your body

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
is likely to be high in mercury.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.868 align:middle line:84%
Subtle, cellular
damage from mercury

01:11:50.868 --> 01:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
is a contributor to the
development of certain diseases

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.750 align:middle line:90%
later in life.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
High body stores of mercury
cause brain damage and memory

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.030 align:middle line:90%
impairment, leading to dementia.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
High mercury levels
can also contribute

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to hypertension, heart
disease, mental disorders,

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%
and endocrine diseases.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So my recommendations
are if you do

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
have fish, choose from the
lowest fat, lowest mercury

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
types, such as flounder,
haddock, salmon, sardines,

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:21.210 align:middle line:90%
scallops, sole, and trout.

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Never accept recreational
fish from questionable waters,

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and never eat high
mercury containing

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
fish, such as blue
fish, mackerel, marlin,

01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:37.180 align:middle line:84%
sea bass, shark, swordfish,
tilefish, and tuna.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.305 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, do not have fish
more than twice a week.

01:12:40.305 --> 01:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
While fish is certainly a
healthier choice compared

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
to red meat and
cheese, too much fish

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
is also associated with
negative health outcomes,

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
such as higher rates
of breast cancer

01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that is thought to be related
to the pollution in fish.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I want
animal products in general

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to be reduced to a smaller
percent of our total calories,

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
because too much animal
protein, not just fat,

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
can have negative
health consequences,

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
such as osteoporosis and
raising the hormones that

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
promote cancer.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I strongly recommend that you
moderate your intake of animal

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
products and treat them more
like a condiment or small side

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
dish rather than as the
main part of the meal.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
The main problem is
that animal products

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
lack the nutrients that protect
us against cancer and heart

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
attacks, fiber, antioxidants,
folate, carotenoids,

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and phytochemicals.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as animal products,
they are rich in substances

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that scientific
studies have shown

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
to be associated with incidences
of cancer and heart disease,

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
such as saturated
fat and cholesterol.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The nutritional scientists
now have their world

01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
turned topsy turvy with
the recent findings

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that increased amounts
of animal proteins

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
raise IGF-1 and may be a larger
factor in cancer promotion

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.530 align:middle line:90%
than even animal fats.

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The facts are diets that
are higher in vegetation

01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and lower animal products have
been shown to be protective

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
against heart attacks,
strokes, and cancers,

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
the leading causes of
premature death in America.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend limiting your
intake of animal products

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to less than 10% of your
total caloric intake.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Full fat versions
of animal products,

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
such as cheeses and butter,
are very high in saturated fats

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and should be avoided even more.

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Instead, choose low fat or fat
free versions, low fat dairy,

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
white meat, wild meats.

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Fish and egg whites are
generally preferred.

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Americans right now
eat approximately 30%

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
of calories from
animal products.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
This is way too
much, contributing

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to our epidemic of heart
disease, strokes, and cancer.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
A small amount a few times
a week won't be a problem,

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.263 align:middle line:84%
but when people eat animal
products at almost every meal,

01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
you can be certain
they'll develop

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.690 align:middle line:90%
serious disease in the future.

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Especially avoid processed
meats, hot dogs, bacon,

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
barbecued meats,
and luncheon meats,

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
as they have a high
level of cancer promoting

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
carcinogens, the strongest
link with cancer.

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that green
vegetables, beans, seeds,

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and nuts are also
high protein foods.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, broccoli
has more protein

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
per calorie than a hamburger.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you get most of
your protein from plants,

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
your body gets flooded
with antioxidants

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and other protective
micronutrients

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
without the cholesterol
and saturated fat

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.540 align:middle line:90%
that are in animal products.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you can't
develop heart disease.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So the point here
is that we should

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
focus on the high
nutrient plant foods,

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and then you automatically
get sufficient protein, even

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
if you eat no animal products.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend you
reduce animal products

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.590 align:middle line:90%
to three small servings a week.

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
That means a total of
12 ounces per week.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember the salad and
the vegetable dishes

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:47.430 align:middle line:90%
are the main dish.

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So treat the animal
products as a side dish

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
or even a condiment to
your meal, possibly added

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to the soup or a vegetable dish
in small amounts to add flavor.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And try many of my
gourmet vegetable recipes.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's review some of
the practical tips

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to thrive with
superior nutrition.

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Many people find
these tips helpful.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Put a sign on your
refrigerator that says

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%
the salad is the main dish.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Set aside two evenings a week
to get most of the cooking, done

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and make enough to have
leftovers for a few days.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Make the investment
in a powerful blender,

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
like a Vitamix, to use to
make the healthful dressings

01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
dips, smoothies, and sorbets
into your diet style.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Try to eat your salad first.

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Eat a salad with a nut based
dressing or raw veggies

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
with a dip to start
both lunch and dinner.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the dangerous
food in your kitchen,

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:48.130 align:middle line:84%
such as sweets, processed foods,
heavily salted foods to avoid

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:50.380 align:middle line:90%
unnecessary temptation.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.345 align:middle line:84%
Make your home a
protected space.

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:54.920 align:middle line:90%


01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Have cooked greens or greens in
soup at every lunch and dinner.

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember the four S's,
smoothies, soups, salad,

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.820 align:middle line:90%
and sorbets.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Have a fruit sorbet or a
fruit dessert after dinner.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Then clean the kitchen,
clean your teeth,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and end eating for the day.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you achieve
tremendous success following

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:18.910 align:middle line:90%
my nutritarian diet style.

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a blessing to eat
great tasting food,

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to have great health, and
avoid medical tragedies,

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:27.610 align:middle line:84%
such as cancer, heart
attacks, and strokes.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
