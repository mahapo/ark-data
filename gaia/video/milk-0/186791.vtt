>> Doctors, health workers
do not get good training

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
in nutrition, and
particularly infant nutrition.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
That's something
which is missing

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:90%
in the medical curriculum.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not receiving
the right attention,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.835 align:middle line:84%
and we would need to have
better trained health workers.

00:19:15.835 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%

they have never studied fully

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
the first bit of humanity,
which is breastfeeding.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
They were not taught about the
recent formula milk feeding,

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
about their lactation, about
how to preserve expressed

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%
breast milk if you are working.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There is the lack of
support from the obstetricians,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
the lack of education
on the nurses' parts

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors' parts in
hospital after the birth.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And what often determines that
they have problems is how many

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
interventions we have during
labor and birth, which cause

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:90%
problems with breastfeeding.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when they run
into all these problems--

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
sore nipples, the baby
doesn't take the breast,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.915 align:middle line:84%
the baby's not getting
enough milk from the breast,

00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
the baby's got colic--

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
the answer to everything is
just give the baby formula.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not surprising
how many mothers have

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:90%
difficulty with breastfeeding.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
There are clinics in many
cities that help mothers.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
some of these clinics

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a wide variety
of people in the breastfeeding

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
clinics.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
just the very basics,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know how to
deal with difficult problems.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm here today after
having gone to three different

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
lactation consultants,
and doctors, and nurses,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and getting the advice from
breastfeeding clinics prior

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to even having the baby.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.105 align:middle line:84%
I've received a lot of confusing
and conflicting information.

00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So I've gotten to
the point where

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I've become quite
frustrated with all of that,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and trying all these different
things that nothing really

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:90%
seems to make sense.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I had been trying a
lot of the techniques

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that I was told to use
and that should work.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling in my gut that
something is still not right.

we are not trained to
know anything about it.

It's across the board.

breastfeeding mother--

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:84%
we are all under
educated in this area.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
We say, and do, and
talk about things

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:90%
that are not evidence based.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we destroy mothers
in their breastfeeding.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:90%
We undermine them.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:90%
We disempower them.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Really we should trust
the mother's body

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:90%
to know what to do with birth.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
We should trust that it's going
to go well for the most part.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
However, when the baby
comes out, all of a sudden,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
we don't trust the
mother's body anymore.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Now we must overregulate it.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:90%
We must put it into rules.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.973 align:middle line:90%
We must say, oh, no, no, no.

00:22:04.973 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
You must follow these rules.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.303 align:middle line:90%
You must do it this way.

00:22:08.303 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%

it was just going to spit out.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
do you want to get
up there faster?

Sure.

if I break your water,

then they're going
to send you up there,

don't feel anything at all.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
but I never gave
birth to a baby.

out later was that,

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
by breaking my water early,
she went into the birth canal,

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:84%

left, and she got stuck.

00:29:39.225 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:90%
The Enfamil I was not expecting.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It actually arrived
after the baby was born,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not too
sure exactly where

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.497 align:middle line:90%
they got my information from.

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have been
from a hospital, because this

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.782 align:middle line:84%
is the brand that
the hospital uses.

00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I have the measuring
tape that they

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
used to do Hunter's
measurements right

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
after he was born
where they marked,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
branded Enfamil right

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:90%
from the hospital.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And this bottle I know came
from my prenatal classes

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital, as well.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:84%
They had them in a basket
for everybody to pick up

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the class.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1970s, it was so
tragic for mothers who thought

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:84%
they were doing the best for
their babies and to see this

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
horrendous consequence when
they believed the billboards,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and the advertising, and
received these free samples.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And to end up with
a dead baby and have

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to carry their dead
baby home in a cloth,

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
it just broke my heart.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Many years the government
has faced the challenge of child

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
mortality, but when it came
to issues of now legislating

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:84%
the international code of
breast milk substitutes,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.355 align:middle line:84%
it was a long and
tedious process.

00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It requires an
advocate, because there

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of vested interests
from the private sector.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were very resistant--

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:90%
extremely resistant.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Kenya had a very
unique situation.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:84%
We had a public health
and sanitation ministry,

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
which was charged with
preventive actions

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.475 align:middle line:84%
towards reduction
of child mortality.

00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the health
budgets, a huge chunk of this

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:90%
is spent on corrective services.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:90%
What is it that we are treating?

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it that we are curing?

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are diseases
that are easily preventable.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We quoted that exclusive
breastfeeding can actually

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:45.700 align:middle line:84%
contribute to 13% reduction
in infant mortality.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:59.242 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.242 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:84%
To do all this, the
investment sounds enormous,

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:90%
looks enormous.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, it is enormous.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go it alone,
it may be almost not doable,

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:84%
but it is through partnerships
and through integration,

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:84%
both into the media and into
high profile legislators.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So the government is fully
committed to educating.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
We are in discussion with Kenya
Association of Manufacturers

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to create awareness with the
marketers and the producers

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of infant formula
on what they can do,

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and what they cannot do,
and what are the penalties

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.485 align:middle line:90%
at their own cost.

00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There are governments
globally that have done very

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
good work in addressing the
marketing and have legislated

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.760 align:middle line:84%
how companies are permitted to
market the product and label

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:84%
their product in
their jurisdictions.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, there are
other countries, particularly

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:84%
producer countries,
such as the US, Canada,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
some of the European countries,
where the products are being

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:84%
produced, and where there
is a very strong lobby

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to protect the industry from
these types of marketing

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:84%
regulations, because,
of course, it

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:84%
would impede their ability
to label and promote

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:90%
as they see fit.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a huge industry.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
They are lobbying for hospitals
to give out their gift packages

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and information, and to doctors
to recommend their products.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting a gift
basket with a breast pump

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:84%
or with supportive advice
on how to breastfeed.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
They're getting it on how
to get on the formula.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.280 align:middle line:84%
World Health
Organization came out

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:84%
with guidelines that were
adopted by many countries,

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and many countries
implemented it,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:90%
but the United States did not.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Marketing is a huge business
and our great country,

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and I believe there is
an economic incentive

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to discourage women
from breastfeeding.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That whole industry
makes a lot of money

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:84%
off of having packaged milk,
as opposed to breastfeeding,

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and the governmental
policies supported

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
their economic interests,
not the health interests

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:90%
of the mother and the child.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The Philippines imports $500
million US yearly of baby milk

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.610 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And the milk companies here in
the Philippines every year--

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:84%
they rake $1 billion
sales every year.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from the
pocket of the poor women who

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
have more children.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a big issue.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's marketing by the milk
companies of just one product--

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
important product, but
glamorized through advertising.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.770 align:middle line:84%
They will be the politicians
to endorse the product

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
through television, through
radio, magazines, billboards,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:90%
even through text messages.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:84%
There is no mercy with
advertising of milk products.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:84%
They entice the
government officials.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:84%
They entice the lawmakers
to break the law

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and weaken the milk code.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's this
misconception that somehow

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Nestle has reformed, and the
other companies have pulled up

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
their socks and
become responsible.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at
the statistics that

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:84%
are being put out by UNICEF and
by the WHO, it's still huge.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It's still well over
a million deaths

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
related to not breastfeeding
globally every year.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we think of how many
years this has been going,

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and how many years the
international code of marketing

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of breast milk substitutes
has been in place since 1981,

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and inappropriate
marketing still continues--

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and we still have
to struggle trying

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to implement these provisions
to protect breastfeeding.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you add up all the
years and all the deaths,

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:90%
it's huge.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in
any other context,

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
if that many children
died, I think we'd all

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:90%
be horrified and outraged.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And we'd want to do all we can.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, year after year, we
see the infant formula companies

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.023 align:middle line:84%
continuing their
inappropriate marketing.

00:37:22.023 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Legislation without sanctions
is like a toothless bulldog.

00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The strength of legislation
is in the sanctions,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's
supposed to be a deterrent.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Wise players know that if I
do not comply to this law,

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:84%
there is an enforcer who
will hit me with the law,

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and the law will hit me hard.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So a law without
penalties is no use

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.245 align:middle line:84%
to the children it is
supposed to protect.

00:38:24.245 --> 00:38:50.931 align:middle line:90%

This is bear brand.

You can drink this as it
is, powdered milk drink.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the milk
that they bought

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because this is
the cheapest one,

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately it says here
that this milk drink is not

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
suitable for infant feeding
and is not a breast milk

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:90%
substitute.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.640 align:middle line:90%
But also this milk is--

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.705 align:middle line:84%
they also put this in
coffee as a coffee creamer.

There is omnipresence
of formula milk

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, so a
lot of mothers think

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that formula milk and breast
milk are just the same.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.700 align:middle line:84%
This isn't even
formula, but they

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
don't have a distinction
between formula, really,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.245 align:middle line:90%
because it's white.

00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:58.525 align:middle line:84%

white, it's the same.

herself in poverty.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:53.704 align:middle line:84%

but, thank god, when
I heard that baby cry,

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I knew she was healthy.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.807 align:middle line:84%
The voice-- it was so
strong and pronounced.

00:56:12.807 --> 00:56:18.164 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.164 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm a grandmother.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.360 align:middle line:84%
The feeling is not
much different.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to make a conscious
effort to differentiate

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the two, knowing that
Kia is my granddaughter,

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.777 align:middle line:90%
and Keela's my daughter.

00:56:32.777 --> 00:56:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter is not my daughter.

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.942 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter's my granddaughter.

00:56:36.942 --> 00:56:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Keela looks at her.

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
She's so in awe of
this beautiful child.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Keela's pumping.

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.410 align:middle line:84%
She's making an adequate amount,
but baby, for some reason,

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.270 align:middle line:84%
didn't latch onto the
breast from the beginning.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So she had formula
from the beginning.

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Since I wanted everything to
go naturally, which it didn't--

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.880 align:middle line:84%
chest to chest after
birth experience,

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that didn't happen, because
also I was in a C-section,

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and I was sleeping.

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the
breastfeeding after birth,

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that didn't happen either,
because I was still sleeping.

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:15.320 align:middle line:84%
My whole plan of
natural totally failed.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It didn't come through.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a little upset that
they didn't help Keela to allow

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.980 align:middle line:84%
the baby to latch a lot better
in the hospital before she came

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:25.940 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I wish it was
different after all.

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I would have preferred not to
have to buy formula obviously.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to finances, I can
do a pretty good juggling act

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.040 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I took some time off from
work because Keela's still

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:41.820 align:middle line:90%
in school.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with her long
before she had baby,

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and I said, at the end of
the day, you go to school.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You gain your education,
because eventually she

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:49.740 align:middle line:90%
will know the story.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.560 align:middle line:84%
She will know how young
you were when you had her.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to do now
is focus, and be positive,

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and live your life
that, when she grows up,

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.610 align:middle line:90%
she will be proud of you.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:59:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Babies that are born
at very low birth weight--

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:48.260 align:middle line:90%
that is less than 1,500 grams--

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.260 align:middle line:90%
they're very fragile.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.280 align:middle line:84%
For very low birth
weight babies,

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.790 align:middle line:84%
mother's own milk is
not just nutrition.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It's also medicine.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It protects them against the
most important complications

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.970 align:middle line:90%
of being born preterm.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
most important thing

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that we can do for our patients
to protect their health,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to promote their growth, and
to promote their long term

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.712 align:middle line:90%
development.

01:00:20.712 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a very stressful
event to have a baby

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.340 align:middle line:90%
in the intensive care unit.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It can take longer for a
mother's milk to come in.

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Our goal behind the
milk bank is to provide

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
human milk as a
bridge until the time

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that the mother's
own milk can come in.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:47.760 align:middle line:90%


01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Cole was born eight days
ago at 26 weeks and one day.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And we really wanted him to
have every possible advantage

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and to do everything
we could for him,

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
so we signed the forms knowing
that that gave the opportunity

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to give him donor milk
as soon as possible,

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%
as soon as he needed it.

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So there would always be
breast milk available for him.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
gifts that someone

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
could have given me,
because a mother's

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
milk, whether mine or someone
else's, is always the best

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
option.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:24.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There were milk banks prior
to 1985, and, unfortunately,

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
when HIV came, the majority
of the milk banks were closed.

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:36.240 align:middle line:90%


01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just a group who saw
the need for donor milk, who

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
brought the proposal
forward to the hospital

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
administrators, who brought
the proposal forward

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
to the Ministry of Health
that allowed us to get funding

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and to build the milk bank.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The milk bank first began
dispensing milk in April 2013.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I am successfully
pumping my own milk,

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and I bring it
into the hospital.

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And they can give it to him
on a syringe with a tube.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
they do to soothe him,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
since we can't pick
him up and hold him,

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
is they will do a
swab of my breast milk

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
and rub it in his mouth.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.202 align:middle line:90%
And that does calm him down.

01:02:24.202 --> 01:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%


01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I am able to touch him.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I can put my hands around him,
hold his hand, hold his foot.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And I am really looking
forward to the day

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
where I can actually
pick him up and hold him.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%


01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:03:41.070 --> 01:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:04:31.080 --> 01:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%


01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.695 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:06:33.695 --> 01:07:36.170 align:middle line:90%


01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> From the very start, I really
wanted to breastfeed my baby.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
My milk supply was
not enough, so I

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
have to search for
some milk donations.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Somebody told me to
post on human milk

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
for human babies, Philippines.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw there that there are milk
requests and milk donations.

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And then many mommies--

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
they texted me and called
me for their milk donations.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a first time mom.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any supply, because
when I put her at my breast,

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
she's always crying.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared
that maybe will--

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
if she's hungry, then
eventually, if she's not fed,

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.720 align:middle line:90%
she will die.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I go to the community,
and look for mothers

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.859 align:middle line:84%
who are breastfeeding,
and ask for their milk.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.439 align:middle line:90%
I do it all the time.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Every day we wake up.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I always told my baby we will go
to my neighbors, to my friends

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.880 align:middle line:90%
that I know.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I even ask my friends, if
you're breastfeeding, can

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I have your milk, or
can I bring you my baby,

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you can teach
her how to latch.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, if they're
busy, then me and my baby

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.569 align:middle line:90%
will go home empty pocket.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:49.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Three mommies donated milk,
so I got 25 bags of milk.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:52.370 align:middle line:90%


01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I breast fed
108 people babies,

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'm proud to be a wet nurse.

01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:00.189 align:middle line:84%
Every time the baby
latches on my breast,

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
it feels so fulfilling, and
they're like my children, also.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I can help him.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:10.149 align:middle line:84%
I can give them my best
milk without any question.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have any concerns
about the health conditions

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of the donating mothers, because
I think they are preparing

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:21.069 align:middle line:90%
their milk for their own babies.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's still safe
for other babies, too.

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> How about you, Joyce?

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:29.319 align:middle line:84%
>> I also experience asking
for milk from a stranger.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.037 align:middle line:84%
I don't know her, but
it takes a lot of guts.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the mother.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.420 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what they eat.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.712 align:middle line:90%
You don't know their lifestyle.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your baby will get sick,
but every I look at my baby

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
gives me the power that it
doesn't matter if you know her

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's for your baby.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:10:00.060 align:middle line:90%


01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the responsibility
of the family,

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
the community that they should
be given the use of natural

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
resources, like
indigenous foods.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
The food is just
around the community.

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:20.845 align:middle line:84%
Our islands is 7,101 islands
full of calcium rich foods,

01:10:20.845 --> 01:10:23.780 align:middle line:90%
full of protein rich foods.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It should not be a food
that will disempower,

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:27.610 align:middle line:90%
especially the mothers.

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%


01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
These women are the
ones who are vulnerable.

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They have no power
economically and politically.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
They should be given the
encouragement, the education,

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The government should recognize
investing a social support,

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
enabling women for
this nurturing power

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to have a healthy population.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the least cost, most
effective, efficient action.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Respond to their needs.

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Give the mom an access
to appropriate food.

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:25.732 align:middle line:90%
No child will go hungry.

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> As a working mother and
one who a child while I was

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
in the city council, I was the
first woman to give birth while

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.790 align:middle line:90%
in office.

01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Many men had fathered children,
but I was the first council

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
woman to give birth
while in office.

01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I raised my daughters
while I was working.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:54.760 align:middle line:90%


01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I even had a filing cabinet.

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I made it into a sort
of a nursery bed.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.276 align:middle line:90%


01:12:03.276 --> 01:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I remember I called my health
and human services office.

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm going
to have a child.

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
What are your
policies for leave?

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%


01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The answer was we
have no policies.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Women just leave.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I said I don't intend to leave.

01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:26.720 align:middle line:90%
I intend to come back to work.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
They said you could
apply for disability,

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and I said the birth of a
child is not a disability.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I refused to apply for
disability to become a mother.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.510 align:middle line:90%


01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
We are alone among
three countries

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:45.400 align:middle line:90%
that don't give paid leave.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
One is Swaziland, Lesotho, and
the United States of America.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that women are
working, and they have to work.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the bills
that I've introduced

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is to give paid leave for the
birth of a child for two weeks.

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:04.070 align:middle line:90%
That's just two weeks.

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people need
their salary, and this

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:08.692 align:middle line:84%
would help them with the
expenses of having a new child.

01:13:08.692 --> 01:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
right thing to do.

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
I believe in it.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to do it.

01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I've had a bill in.

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I passed it once in the
House, and it did not

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
pass in the Senate, but
I will continue trying.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.750 align:middle line:90%


01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The maternity leave
is in the Employment Act.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
This is one area
where we partner

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
very strongly with
the trade union

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
movement so that
every employer can

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
be able to provide
maternity leave,

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and will see the
benefits for themselves

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and for their employees.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And that employee should
not be penalized in any way.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.530 align:middle line:90%
They get full salary.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They come back to
their previous job

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:52.580 align:middle line:90%
without loss of any seniority.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They also get
their annual leave.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is now a
joint partnership.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
All the leaders of the
trade union movement--

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
they are on the forefront
of championing this cause.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
These are all benefits as
responsible governments

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.480 align:middle line:90%
we must protect.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe, as you
get more women elected,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
they will carry more
of a women's agenda.

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
We are roughly 20% of the
United States Congress.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.650 align:middle line:90%
We are 50% of the population.

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So to get true parity you would
have to elect a great deal more

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.945 align:middle line:90%
women.

feeding.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
When you pull out a bottle
in a circle full of moms,

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.110 align:middle line:90%
everybody looks.

01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's kind of
curious, and that's OK.

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind the curiosity,
but it's something different.

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:29.992 align:middle line:84%
It didn't bother me to
watch other women breastfeed

01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
or to have them
breastfeeding in the room

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%

bother somebody that I'm

Did we wait too long
to change your diaper?

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I did feel that I was questioned
for my decision, which

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I thought was strange.

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Why did you choose
to bottle feed?

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't ask women why
they choose to breastfeed.

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I had to
justify my decision.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I stuck to my guns on this one.

01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I know I did what
was best for me

in the face of a
lot of opposition,

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:54.992 align:middle line:84%
and I stuck to what I
felt was most important.

01:17:54.992 --> 01:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's worked
really well for us.

hardcore, and it's fine.

01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of hardcore, too.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.148 align:middle line:84%
I think breastfeeding
is the best

01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
thing you can do for your
baby if you're able to,

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:20.523 align:middle line:84%
but when you're someone like
me, and you're not able to,

01:18:20.523 --> 01:18:21.820 align:middle line:90%
there's no it's OK.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Do this, then this, and it's
fine to use a bottle sometimes.

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%
It's one or the other.

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>> He would not drink.

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
He used to have one
bottle of formula a day,

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and I felt so guilty,
like really guilty.

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:39.920 align:middle line:90%
People push ideas.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I was so busy listening to
all these attachment parenting

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
blogs, or the pediatrician,
or the consultant,

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.970 align:middle line:90%
and I forgot to listen to him.

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:54.610 align:middle line:90%


01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought it was OK.

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I could understand the reasons.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They said there might be a
man or a nervous child seeing

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
this small piece of flesh that
they weren't quite expecting.

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So I whispered and tiptoed
with nervous discretion.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But after six months of her
life sat sitting on lids,

01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
sipping on milk, nostril
sniffing on piss,

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
trying not to bang your head
on toilet roll dispensers,

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I wonder whether these
public loo feeds offend her,

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm getting tired of
discretion and being polite,

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because my baby first sips
are now drenched in shite.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I spent the first feeding
months of her beautiful life

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.210 align:middle line:90%
feeling nervous and awkward.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I wanted everything right.

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Surrounded by family till
I stepped out of the house,

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
it took me eight weeks to get
the confidence to go into town.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Now the comments around
me cut like a knife

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
as I rush into toilet cubicles
feeling nothing like nice.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm giving her milk
that's not in a bottle,

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
wishing the cocaine generation
white powder would topple.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I've seen pyramid sales
pitches across our green globe,

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and female breasts banned unless
they're out just for show.

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the more I go out, the
more I can't stand this.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I walk into town, feel
I'm surrounded by bandits,

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
because in this country of
billboards covered in tits,

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and family newsagent
magazines full of it, WH Smith

01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.510 align:middle line:90%
put shelves out for men.

01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you complain
about them then?

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:24.950 align:middle line:84%

are for man.

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.734 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting embarrassed in
case a small flash of flesh

01:20:30.734 --> 01:20:31.610 align:middle line:90%
might offend.

01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not trying to parade it.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to make a show.

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:39.158 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm told I'd be
better just staying at home,

01:20:39.158 --> 01:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and whenever another friend
I know is thrown off a bus,

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
then another mother told
to get out of a pub,

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
even my grandma said
maybe I was sexing it up--

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure the
milk makers love

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
all this fuss, all the
cussing, and worry, and looks

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
of disgust, as
another mother turns

01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
from nipples to powder,
ashamed or embarrassed

01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:59.110 align:middle line:90%
by comments around her.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And as a hold her head up
and pull my cardi across,

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and she sips on the liquor
made by everyone's got a thing.

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:06.490 align:middle line:90%
For god's sake, Jesus drank it.

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So did Siddhartha,
Mohammed, and Moses,

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and both of their fathers,
Ganesh and Shiva, and Brigid

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.900 align:middle line:90%
and Buddha.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they weren't
doing it sniffing on shit

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
as their mothers sat
embarrassed on cold toilet lids

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in a country of billboards
covered in tits.

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
In a country of low cut
tops, cleavage, and skin,

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.570 align:middle line:84%
in a country of cloth
bags and recycling bins.

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:28.426 align:middle line:84%
And as I desperately
try to take all of this

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:32.320 align:middle line:84%
in, hold her head up,
I can't get my head

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
around my anger towards us,
and not to the sound of lorries

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.280 align:middle line:84%
offloading formula
milk into countries

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
where water runs dripping in
filth, in towns where breasts

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
are oases of life now dried
up in two for one offers,

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
enticed by labels, and logos,
and gold standard rights

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
claiming breast
milk is healthier

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
powdered and white,
packaged, and branded,

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and sold at price
so that nothing

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is free in this money
fueled life, which is fine

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
if you need it or prefer to use
bottles, where water is clean

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and bacteria boiled.

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But in towns where they drown
in pollution and sewage,

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:12.600 align:middle line:84%
bottled kids die, and they
knew that they'd do it.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
In towns where pennies
are savored like sweets,

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
we're now paying for one
thing that's always been free.

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
In towns empty of hospital
beds, babies die, diarrhea,

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040 align:middle line:84%
feared their breast
milk would end.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So no more, when I sit on
these cold toilet lids,

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
no matter how embarrassed
I feel as she sips, because

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
in this country of
billboards covered in tits,

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I think I should try
to get used to this.

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:41.570 align:middle line:90%
