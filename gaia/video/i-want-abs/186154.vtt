00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:90%

After this, that's it.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start exercising,

me because, like many people,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been putting off

And I grew up in an extremely
health conscious family.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
My Russian parents
didn't much care

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
for conforming to
society, which made

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:90%
for an interesting childhood.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
For the bulk of my youth, I
ate nothing but raw vegan food,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
slept on a wooden plank
instead of a mattress,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
took polar plunges
and frozen lakes,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and hiked across America while
foraging for wild edibles.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Those were some
exciting times that

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
vastly expanded my
worldview and helped

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
me shape some core beliefs
about the importance of being

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:90%

Never in a million
years did I ever

think that I would have to
worry about being chubby.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
But I was wrong.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Despite living what I considered
a healthy, active lifestyle,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
I started getting fat.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
At age 30, life stress,
relaxed eating choices,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and a slowing
metabolism appeared

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to be the perfect
weight gaining recipe.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Seeing my reflection
in the mirror

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
was becoming increasingly
more painful,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
as it depicted a dude with a
protruding gut, flabby love

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:90%

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Getting on a scale was
equally unpleasant,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%

around the 200 pound mark.

by gaining weight.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Putting on the pounds was
crushing my self-esteem,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
stealing my happiness, and
making my general attitude

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:90%
towards life shitty.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:90%
I was stuck in a vicious cycle.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Feeling heavy killed any
motivation I had to work out.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And a lack of exercise added
more weight, stress, and burden

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:90%
to my life.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I observed my friends who
were in their 40s and 50s

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and noticed that many of
them had weight issues.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Through friendly
conversations, I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
learned that working
out at 40 or 50

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
was even more cumbersome
than it was at 30 for me.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
These observations ultimately
led me to an epiphany.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
At no point in time will it
be easier to get in shape

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:90%
than now.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Every year that I
wait to make a change

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
will make it exponentially
harder to lose the weight

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and achieve my fitness goals.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after this realization,
I was cruising around

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
on the internet and I typed
before and after fitness photos

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:90%
into a search bar.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Right out the gate, I was struck
by how profound some people's

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:90%
transformations were.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Not only did their bodies
look more toned and muscular,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
but their eyes seemed brighter,
their posture straighter,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.032 align:middle line:90%
and their smiles wider.

00:06:24.032 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I caught myself on the thought
that the people in the after

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
photos looked generally
younger and happier

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
than their old selves.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I was also taken aback at how
inspirational a simple photo

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
can be just by looking at
an image, an image that

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
was free of words, I
felt a strong drive

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
to start exercising
and change my ways.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Those photos lit a fire under my
ass and gave me the motivation

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I needed to say,
enough is enough,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and tackle my personal fitness
goals once and for all.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I craved hard core stamina.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I desire a V-shaped torso,
a strong core, muscular arms

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and solid legs.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I wanted abs.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I desperately wanted abs.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I vowed then and there that I
would find a way to get them.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I was pumped and ready to go.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.557 align:middle line:84%

didn't know where I was going

it be to lie to myself about

accountable and on track.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
accountability, I hoped

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
that those unflattering

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
give me motivation to continue
training should I ever

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:90%
find myself in a workout low.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
After thoroughly
measuring my entire body,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
I paid my personal
trainer a visit

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
and had him conduct a body
composition test in order

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
to figure out my weight and
total body fat percentage.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a body comp?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A body comp is just
your percentage body fat.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I like all of my clients to be
between 10% and 20% body fat.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
To give you an idea, the
typical American is 37%.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
That's horrific.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Less than 8% of
Americans are under 20%.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You want to be 10%
to 20% body fat.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where optimal
health is achieved.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
How I achieve a body
comp is a caliper test.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll take five measurements.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a little
chart that gives me your age.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And I can extrapolate
and figure out

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
within 1 percentage point
of what your body comp is.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I like using body comp
because it's very accurate.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I've done thousands of them.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people use
body mass index, or BMI,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
which is only accurate in
about 50% of the people.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have you
at 22% body fat.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I like to have all of my
clients between 10% and 20%.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a great goal over
the next 12 weeks is to get you

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
to 12%.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So we want to lose about
10% of your body fat.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.805 align:middle line:84%
What's your actual
physical weight?

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Or should we do a weigh-in?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a weigh-in.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do a weigh-in.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I did one already, but
my scale might have not been

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
accurate.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's use this
scale right over here.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to let
you bring it over.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:90%
200.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
That's 150.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And move this to this.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:90%
So it looks like we got 188.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I've actually gained a
pound since my last weigh-in.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to talk
about dietary intake.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So 188.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
These are just
biomarkers that we're

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
going to use from now on
over the next 12 weeks.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it hard to get abs?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It is very hard to get abs.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a lifestyle
change for most people.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
There are genetics
play a part of it.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, if you
really want that six pack abs,

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:90%
it's a lifestyle change.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
nutrition is huge.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Activity obviously is huge.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.662 align:middle line:84%
But nutrition is probably
the biggest component.

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And then outside of that, it's
also taking care of yourself

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:84%
through exercise and proper
rest to maintain a good hormone

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
balance as well.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think anybody can get
abs so long as they have

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
the metabolic base
necessary to do so.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I find with
the clients I work with

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
is that a great deal of
people, particularly women,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and many men, are
metabolically compromised

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
from things like
persistent dieting,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
eating the wrong foods.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.638 align:middle line:84%
They've become very
insensitive to insulin.

00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think the easy
answer is that, yes, it

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult to get abs.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Getting abs is incredibly
easy if you have the right

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
program design.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I specialize in
functional training,

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
where you utilize
multiple muscle groups

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
in a 3-dimensional fashion.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to alter the pattern.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you have
a lot of people

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:90%
that just do one exercise.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:90%
They do crunches, as an example.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You want to do a lot
of different exercises.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You want to be consistent
in your program design.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a program that
works everything and brings

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:90%
balance to the system.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, abs are made
in the kitchen too.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:90%
It's your dietary intake.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You can have titanium abs,
and if you're 28% body fat,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
have that cut look.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get down, if
you're a man, around 10%,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
woman, 12% to 15%.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Body comp is really critical
to actually see those abs.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what a
lot of people don't get.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Having a good functional
training program

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that lasts about 50 minutes,
three or four times a week,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and you will get
titanium adds if you

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
are consistent with your program
and you have the right dietary

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:90%
intake.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:90%
That's critical.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Guaranteed.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.562 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:12:47.562 --> 00:12:50.052 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:50.052 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's March 6.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm rolling over to my
first training session

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:90%
with John Hacker.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that he's going
to kick my butt today.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
excited about this.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
start working out.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, I'm
growing out a beard.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I have a 6 o'clock
shadow going on.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have decided
that for the entire 12

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
weeks of this project, I'm
going to be growing my beard

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:90%
to show time.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully by the
end of the 12 weeks,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll have rock hard abs
as well as a big beard

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.781 align:middle line:84%
to prove that I did
this and that I'm real.

00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, Sergei.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> What up?

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> How you doing, man?

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.295 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm doing great.

00:13:45.295 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you ready?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so excited.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> First exercise we're going to
do is a little exercise called

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:90%
the Roman Twist.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Take this ball down.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Right over there, and I
want you to sit on the ball.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Bridge out.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Center of the neck
center the ball.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Like this?

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Put your hands up straight.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Hip up.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to rotate
the ball on your shoulders.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:90%
15 to 20.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The closer you put your feet
together, the more challenging

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But don't put them so close
that you're falling of the ball.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Always stay in
control, my friend.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Going into this project, I
was well aware that it would be

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:90%
difficult to get a six pack.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Every person that I
interviewed told me pretty much

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
There are no shortcuts
or quick fixes.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
If you want abs, you have to
put in the time and effort.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
After discussing my goals
with my personal trainer,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
he helped me devise
a 3-month program

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to help me get the
results I was after.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
the next 12 weeks,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I would be engaging in various
functional fitness workouts

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
three to five times per week for
about 50 minutes per session.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.242 align:middle line:84%
I specifically chose functional
fitness as my workout method

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
get fit in a way that

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
would help me move through
life with more ease

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and not just enable me to
lift heavy weights at the gym.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> How's that core doing?

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Feel it?

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Feel it?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.035 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:15:05.035 --> 00:15:05.835 align:middle line:90%
Do a couple more.

00:15:05.835 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Do a couple more.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're freaking
out the bogie in us now.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Did I mention I
hate ab exercises.

00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:14.995 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:17.544 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love them soon.

00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And rest.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
On this one, where
did you feel the most?

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, in my
abs, in my lower abs.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:84%
That's where we want to
hit, below the belly button

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
hard area to hit.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.642 align:middle line:84%
This exercise is an exercise
that would get that.

00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean it's amazing.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- you're really not
doing all that much, but it's--

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> You're doing a lot.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I can tell--

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I see people at the
other places where

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I work that just do
crunches all the time, which

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
is the worst thing you can do.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll be really strung up
here and then they'll just boop.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.523 align:middle line:84%
They'll be really
weak below that.

00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, you want to have
balance to the system.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:90%
You want to attack everything.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I mean, you just
brought up a really good point,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
because while the movie
is called "I Want Abs,"

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%
it's not just about abs.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have a
rock hard six pack and then

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
weak, dysfunctional
everything else.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, the best
training program is one that

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:90%
attacks the weaker areas.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You want to bring balance
to the whole system.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this whole
project is all about,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:90%
bringing balance to the system.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Any training program
should be like that.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
You want to attack
your weak areas.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:84%
You want to just be really
strong and fit and healthy.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what most people want.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.632 align:middle line:84%
>> So doing this is going
to eat me all around like--

00:16:35.632 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Health and wellness.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Health and wellness, but
also a proportionate ripped--

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as a side
effect, as a side effect.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You are powerful beyond measure.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you just got me
ready for my second set.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Second set.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
You are powerful beyond
I measure, my friend.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:90%

workout session with John.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say, even though
I didn't do anything too crazy,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm worked.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Apparently my
entire core is weak,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and it needs a lot of work.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
continue on this path

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, like he
says, get titanium abs.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to my
workouts with John,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I needed a little
bit of supplementary help

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to reach
my fitness goals.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I hired a second
personal trainer,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
who specialized in
kettlebell training.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Unlike a traditional
dumbbell, a kettlebell

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:84%
is engineered so that
its weight is off center.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Because of this off
centered design,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
a kettlebell recruits
more stabilizing muscles

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and works your body more
like a concentration camp

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
than a piece of gym equipment.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Thus, kettlebell
training is considered

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.376 align:middle line:84%
by many as the ultimate
form of functional fitness.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about it.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Think about what's happening.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:90%

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Nic was just saying that when
you get a heavier kettlebell,

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you can use more of the weight
to counterbalance yourself

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:90%
on a pistol.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that actually makes
the movement slightly easier.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So for this exercise,
the lighter the weight,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:90%
the more difficult that it is.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> As we talked about
last time with the cleans,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
when we do the alternating,
it becomes less that hip hinge

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's more that straight up and
straight down, corkscrew down,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:90%
corkscrew up.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.492 align:middle line:84%
If I'm doing an
alternating movement,

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
One's going to stay where it is.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so getting that full
hip hinge isn't really

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:90%
going to work.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So you know how when you
watch Sergei do his cleans

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and snatches, he's
almost kind of straight

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:90%
up and down through a lot of it?

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
All right, you're going to
do a lot of the same thing.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're really still
absorbed at the hips.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.778 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to
connect and deflect

00:20:51.778 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, all right, but
it's just kind of soft movement

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Corkscrew down, corkscrew up.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
So, right, we come up.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Catch it.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.837 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be-- you're now
going to go down right hand,

00:21:08.837 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
absorb and come right back up.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.322 align:middle line:90%
I just corkscrew down, up.

00:21:13.322 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
little bit of a twist.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
You got to be strong.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You got to be strong
in that fixation.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.822 align:middle line:90%
All right, that lock out there.

00:21:26.822 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Up, lock it.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Down.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I just finished a
kettlebell workout,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
which I do because it
helps me build muscle.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
really good cardio.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So is it going to be burning
that extra fat off my body.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Today, was a fundamentals
class, where we really

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
get to do all the movements
and learn how to do it right

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and learn how to do it safe.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing because
today I was kind of in a funk.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of tired of
the diet and, you know,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:90%
just kind of hit a low point.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And doing something active
has once again lifted my mood.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And I feel all around happy
and well and energized.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So if anything else
the kettlebell workout

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:90%
was good for that.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.458 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So I want to watch it.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to throw it to you.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.142 align:middle line:90%
You're going to catch it.

00:22:37.142 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Do a half squat.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And then throw it back.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:90%
All right, ready?

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Half squat.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.775 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eye on the ball.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Eye on the ball.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
As adults we don't really
play catch very much.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
This is great for hand-eye
coordination, balance, reaction

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Man, you haven't fallen off yet.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Most people have fallen
off by this time.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Bring your hips in a little bit.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Stay in alignment.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Bring the right foot
over a little bit more.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.107 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:23:16.107 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Feeling that in the trunk?

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And the core?

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 15 to 20, each side.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the body
will want to cheat.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't let the body cheat, man.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

Last one.

All right, rest.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.862 align:middle line:90%
So this little fact finding.

00:24:14.862 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
This is first time
we've done this.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:90%
We have muscle failure.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Muscle failure is success.

not resting enough?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you get hurt.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:90%
You get overtraining syndrome.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Classic symptoms are fatigue,
feeling kind of rundown,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
crankiness, not
sleeping at night,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
overeating or under eating.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to achieve so
much more benefit if you train

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
properly and not
training all the time

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
at a really high level,
because if you push yourself,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, not only you have
the possibility of having

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.046 align:middle line:84%
that overtraining, but also
your risk of injury goes up.

One of the really important
reasons for this counterbalance

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:84%
that I'm giving
you this 110 pounds

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
is it does take a lot of the
stress off of the lower back

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.794 align:middle line:84%
and really helps you focus on
the rectus abdominal, or lower

abs.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Excellent, and rest.

Good job, man.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, man.

00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:37.962 align:middle line:90%

a few sets of this,

I can feel the energy
flowing back in.

Wow.

>> Today is April 2.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this project
for exactly one month.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided that today
would be a really good day

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and spend a couple
minutes discussing how I feel

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:90%
and going through everything.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Before going into
this project, I

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
was experiencing some symptoms
that were somewhat alarming as

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:90%
far as my health is concerned.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling very shaky.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I was having a lot of trouble
sleeping, very low energy,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
like my energy was very erratic.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
All of those symptoms
have completely gone away.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:90%
I feel alive.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I have this certain spring in my
step that wasn't there before.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:90%
I can see my stomach shrinking.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Like check this out.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, this might
not look like abs yet.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But literally a month ago,
this was out to here, you know.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I
pinch my stomach,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot less to pinch.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
My arms are getting bigger.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.818 align:middle line:90%
My arms are getting bigger.

00:28:01.818 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that my
clothes are fitting

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:90%
better than ever before.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding that I'm
wearing shirts and pants that I

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
haven't worn in about a year.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
When I go to cinch my belt, the
hole that I normally cinch to

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
is too loose.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So I go down two or
three holes past that.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
After a month I'm
moving differently,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
my thighs aren't
rubbing together as much

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
as they did, which I never
really told anybody about,

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
because I was a little
bit embarrassed.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was starting to
chafe in between my thighs,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.940 align:middle line:84%
because, I guess, they
were getting really big.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.303 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening anymore.

00:28:31.303 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the routine
is that I've been

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:90%
exercising five days a week.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been training
with a kettlebell guy.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.818 align:middle line:84%
I've been training with
my core workout trainer.

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been running a
little bit on the side.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Most days it's just 55 minutes
of exercise and that's it.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up the
next day feeling sore.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:90%
My abs are hurting.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
My muscles all over
the body are sore.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm shocked with the
amount of exercise

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that this protocol requires,
because it's much less

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.958 align:middle line:90%
than I originally thought.

And the reason why is
that everybody has them.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.703 align:middle line:90%
Like you have abs.

00:29:15.703 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be able
to support yourself

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
through activities,
such as walking,

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't have abs.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The issue is whether
or not they're visible.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can make the lines
or the cuts in your abs

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.740 align:middle line:84%
deeper through
training, but you need

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to reduce body fat accordingly
to make them visible.

>> The biggest mistake that
clients will come to me that

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
they'll make is they'll get
into this huge caloric deficit.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, if
you starve yourself,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you're going
to gain stored energy.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:90%
You're going to put on body fat.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I've had clients that were
eating less than 1,000 calories

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:90%
a day that we're 30% body fat.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to eat.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:90%
You've got to feed the machine.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
By feeding the machine, you will
liberate that stored energy.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
I tell everybody,

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:90%
stay away from anything white.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't eat white potatoes,
sugar, bread, flour.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely don't
want to pig out on meat.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
That's real important.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you want
to eat a lot of vegetables.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Smoothies are good.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Your largest meal
should be breakfast.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Smallest meal should be dinner.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And for the first month during
the initial conditioning phase,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to
bed a little hungry.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's critical to have
a breakfast period.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You want to wake up
really, really hungry.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
When you start waking
up hungry, that's

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
telling me that your
metabolic rate is going up.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So that should be
your biggest meal.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And then eat every three hours.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Shortening the meals
as you get to dinner.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Dinner, again, should
be your smallest meal.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you
eat at 6 o'clock,

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.770 align:middle line:84%
then you shouldn't eat
anything until 6 o'clock

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:90%
the next morning.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to not
really have anything

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:84%
in your digestive tract
when you're sleeping.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:90%
several bad dietary habits.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
As it was before, I frequently
skipped eating breakfast

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to get to
work a little faster.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Once at work, I forgot
about food for hours

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.100 align:middle line:84%
until my body gave me the
"I need food now" signal.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:84%
In a hungry state,
I often settled

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:84%
for less than
perfect food choices

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and regularly gorged
myself until I was stuffed.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Then, I would take
another massive break

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
from eating until
I was once again

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
starving and ready
to overindulge.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Around 9:00, 10:00,
or 11:00 at night,

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd get hungry again
and eat a huge dinner.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd go to sleep as my body
started digesting my last meal.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
This type of feeding
schedule was like an anvil

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:90%
for my metabolism.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It slowed it down to a crawl
and definitely contributed

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to my weight gain.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It also made me feel
sluggish and old.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, in an effort to save
time and be more productive,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I actually started
feeling crappy,

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:84%
which significantly
hindered the amount of work

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I could do in a day.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, my new
diet, which emphasizes

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
eating a big breakfast, followed
by reasonably sized meals

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
every two to three hours
throughout the day,

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
keeps my metabolism high
and my blood sugar level.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:84%
As a result, I feel more
energetic, more satiated,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:90%
have fewer mood swings.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to liberate
stored energy, a.k.a. fat,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:90%
at a steady rate.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
This way of eating has also
reminded me how pleasant

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:90%
it is to cook my own meals.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Cooking at home
lets me be creative

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and allows me to make
art in the form of food.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It forces me to unplug
from all the electronics

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that are constantly
competing for my attention

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and helps me spend time
with the people that I love.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It seems counterintuitive,
but this routine also

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%
helps me save tons of time.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Every day of this
project, my sister

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
comes over to help
me make my meals.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Together, we spend
about an hour cutting up

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:90%
various fruits and vegetables.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
We make delicious
soups and salads,

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
using the best,
healthiest ingredients,

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and devise new recipes to
keep things interesting.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Within this single hour, we
manage to make all of our meals

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:84%
for the entire day,
including snacks.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Once we're done, we're done.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
All of our food gets neatly
packed into glass jars.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Then when hunger strikes,
all we have to do

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is open the jar of
food and enjoy it.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
This literally saves
me hours per week

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
as hunting for three or
four individual meals

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:90%
daily takes up a lot of time.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
As for the contents
of my diet, my food

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:90%
hasn't changed all that much.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
what I eat consists

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
of raw fruits and vegetables.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
This means lots of
big, big salads,

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and lots of ripe
fruit as nibbles.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I also like to
eat cooked grains,

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
such as buckwheat, millet,
quinoa, and roasted root

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.118 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, because they
add substance to my diet.

00:33:36.118 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing that
I've changed about the way

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that I eat is I've added
some animal products back

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:90%
into my diet.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, I ate an
entirely vegan diet

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:90%
for 18 years of my life.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
For 15 of those years,
I was extremely strict

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:90%
and followed 100% raw food diet.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Though my rigid dietary
choices initially

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.080 align:middle line:84%
helped me overcome my
childhood health problems,

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:84%
they also eventually
led me to develop

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
several serious
nutrient deficiencies.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
I could no longer

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:84%
deny that my diet
wasn't serving me.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So I started experimenting
with farm fresh animal products

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and regain my
vibrancy once again.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.449 align:middle line:84%
Presently, I eat eggs,
fish, and poultry,

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.639 align:middle line:84%
and think it's very important
to source these things

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:84%
from small, local farms
where animals live happy

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:90%
lives and are treated well.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.179 align:middle line:84%
Most of the animal
products that I presently

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
consume come from my friend's
farm called Willow Wit Ranch.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I've personally been
on their property

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and can be certain that their
animals are well cared for.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
My general stance
on animal products

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
is such, if you're going to
be able to eat eggs, fish,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:84%
chicken, et cetera,
it's a good idea

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
are ethically raised.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:84%
Every morning of this
project, as well as

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.560 align:middle line:84%
every morning in general, I
start with a green smoothie.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Green smoothies have a wide
array of health benefits.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
They're hydrating
for the whole body.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They provide good muscle
and tissue repair.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.850 align:middle line:84%
In my documentary "Powered
by Green Smoothies,"

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I followed around
10 athletes and made

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.440 align:middle line:84%
them drink a quart of green
smoothie every single day.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
green smoothies

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.130 align:middle line:84%
helped them to improve
their endurance,

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:84%
help them recover
better, and just help

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:90%
them feel all around awesome.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So in this documentary,
I'm definitely

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
going to be using green
smoothies as part of my meals.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.298 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.298 --> 00:35:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things I want to
talk about is I try to get all

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:90%
my clients in the pool.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The pool is magical as far
as strength, endurance,

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and flexibility.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.125 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing
a pool workout,

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:25.560 align:middle line:84%
you're basically doing
thousands of core rotations.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.342 align:middle line:84%
I cannot wait to
get you in the pool.

00:35:27.342 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're re-engineering
your body,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
a combination of strength
training, functional training,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.208 align:middle line:84%
and swimming will really
give you incredible abs.

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, keep back in use.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%


00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.225 align:middle line:84%
So don't fight the water
when you have this on, OK.

00:35:45.225 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to kick so you're
going to be conserving energy,

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.930 align:middle line:84%
because you still have
like an eight beat kick.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You're still wasting a
lot of energy kicking.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
This is going to keep the
lower body on the surface,

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
rotate on the surface.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And really focus
on good rotation,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:84%
turning your head to
breathe, and trying

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:90%
to get the timing down.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's try this.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It's called a pull buoy.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't think e-dimensionally
where your hands are like that,

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:84%
because you'll
freak yourself out.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.560 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.143 align:middle line:84%
Thinking can be a
dreadful affliction.

00:36:15.143 --> 00:36:15.943 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:15.943 --> 00:36:17.325 align:middle line:90%
Rotation, and let's swim at 25.

00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.144 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:36:29.144 --> 00:36:32.132 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:32.132 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Last month this was
substantially bigger.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:90%
This is my muffin top.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And the month before
that it was even bigger.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this, last month,
became soft, kind of jiggly.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
started to shrink.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I've also noticed from working
on my arms and my upper body,

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
just bigger arms, bigger biceps,
bigger pecs, stronger back.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Today, I did my third body comp.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Body comp, again, is where
I measure my fat, my weight,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and John does some calculations
and kind of tells me

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
where I'm at, how much
further, I need to go.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And as of today, May 8, I have
dropped another 2.5% body fat.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's about 8% total.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I've dropped about
14 pounds in weight.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've gained between
5 and 6 pounds of muscle.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The last week, though, has
been kind of challenging.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been having ups and downs
in my mood and my energy.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Feeling like am I going
to get there, you know?

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to have
rock hard abs?

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
After all, the documentary
is called "I Want Abs."

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's critical
that at the end of it

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I have a six pack that
I could be proud of.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's been
happening repeatedly

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is people have been coming
up to me and saying,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know, how
are your abs going?

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Show me your abs.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I lift up my shirt
reluctantly, they're like,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.340 align:middle line:90%
oh, you still have a ways to go.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
that these folks,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been
with me since day one.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:02.662 align:middle line:84%
They haven't seen me
firsthand, you know, naked

00:41:02.662 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
at the start of the projects.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't seen the
progress I've already made.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still very much in
the process of developing

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:90%
definition and showing abs.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself has
been kind of discouraging,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of been
like freaking me out.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Like will I make it?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.730 align:middle line:84%
My plan of attack for
that specifically,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:84%
now when people say,
show me your abs,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.145 align:middle line:84%
how's it going, I'm
going to tell them

00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
see my abs, you're

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.830 align:middle line:84%
going to have to purchase this
movie because you ain't getting

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.760 align:middle line:90%
nothing for free.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I wonder sometimes
if this documentary

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.650 align:middle line:90%
isn't lacking drama.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Thus far, there
hasn't been any drama.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just been like
positive all the way.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And, sure, there are
days that are harder

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and there are days where
I don't want to work out.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:90%
But they're few and far between.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
this, that when

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I do go and work out
and push through that,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I just feel 100% better.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, I felt pretty
crummy, I went to my workout,

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.040 align:middle line:84%
a couple bosu flies
into it, I felt better.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Then a couple more
bosu balls into it,

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:90%
I felt like incredible.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a couple
hours since that I'm

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:90%
recording this check-in.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:90%
I still feel really good.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm addicted now.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:middle line:90%
I think I can't quit.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
maintainable lifestyle

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that I've been living the
last couple of months.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
ultimately when I

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:84%
get to the end of
filming this documentary,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't foresee myself
changing a whole lot,

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
really miss anything

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.260 align:middle line:90%
from how I used to do things.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Like the food is awesome.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:90%
The exercise is great.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It's 95% positive.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the lows
are to be expected.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.858 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.858 --> 00:42:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Our health and
wellness is priceless.

00:42:45.525 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't put a
value on this, which

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:84%
it blows my mind that some
people, the first thing to go

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.952 align:middle line:84%
is their fitness program,
their dietary intake.

00:42:53.952 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But this is like the most
important thing, because it

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.368 align:middle line:90%
enhances the human condition.

00:42:57.368 --> 00:42:59.285 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's interesting
that you bring that up,

00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle line:84%
because this week, what I've
kind of run into over and over

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.987 align:middle line:84%
again, is people
coming up to me.

00:43:03.987 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They know that I'm
doing this project.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They to try and
lift up my shirt,

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:08.833 align:middle line:90%
which is a little intrusive.

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they're like,
why are you doing this?

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.083 align:middle line:90%
Why are you working on your abs?

00:43:12.083 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
There's so many other things
that you could be working on.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Like isn't that a
little conceited?

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to say it's like
been a little bit harder.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of brought
me down a little bit,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:84%
because I'm thinking
like, I mean,

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.250 align:middle line:84%
am I doing something wrong
here by working on my body?

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What interests me the most
about those people who lift up

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:84%
your shirt and say,
why are you doing this,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
is my counter to that is, why
would you not be doing this?

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Because your health and wellness
is the most important thing

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.700 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.167 align:middle line:84%
It's way more important than
stuff or money or anything

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:45.000 align:middle line:84%
else, because if you
don't have your health,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.300 align:middle line:90%
you don't have anything.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And I know what that's like.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember lying in a
hospital room for 22 days

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:84%
not having my
health and wellness.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing about
being cut and having great abs,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that's a byproduct of just
being incredibly healthy.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not conceited.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think you're
doing the world a service

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:84%
by being as fit and as
healthy as possible,

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.410 align:middle line:84%
because then you can
operate on a higher level

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and you can help other people.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.667 align:middle line:84%
So it's very non-conceded
to really work

00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:15.000 align:middle line:84%
on your health and wellness,
because it helps everybody.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It brings everybody up.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So I don't understand
that type of mentality.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people, they don't get it.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't get that your health
and wellness is everything.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And it enhances the
human condition.

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.525 align:middle line:90%
And that it truly is priceless.

00:44:30.525 --> 00:44:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't put a price on it,
which is why what you're doing

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is the best investment anybody
could ever make, period.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So-- so let's start investing.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.070 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be interactive.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw
that ball to you,

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
throw it back to me.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That was great.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.800 align:middle line:90%
So how's it feeling, man?

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Feeling good?

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my goodness.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend a
personal trainer at least

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, because few people
can do that by themselves.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.802 align:middle line:84%
And I'm definitely not
one of those people.

00:45:46.802 --> 00:45:49.232 align:middle line:90%

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we have about 15 days
left until I'm supposed to be

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:56.930 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So I'll be at that 3-month mark.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So one thing I'm noticing
is that there's like--

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.305 align:middle line:84%
I'm developing more
muscle definition.

00:46:04.305 --> 00:46:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think I could
get there, but it's

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:90%
starting to stress me out.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking should I
add another moment in order

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:90%
to really get--

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.250 align:middle line:84%
should I make it four
months instead of three.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the movie's
called "I Want Abs,"

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be indisputable.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.495 align:middle line:90%
I want undisputed abs.

00:46:25.495 --> 00:46:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
really good progress,

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.242 align:middle line:84%
but I think I could
come down even more.

00:46:30.242 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:84%

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I was hoping that I
could pick your brain and just

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.060 align:middle line:90%
kind of--

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:90%
can you help me out with that?

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So just like flex
your abs for me.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, just act like
you're all like heated,

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:90%
like ready to beat someone up.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your lats,
because in bodybuilding,

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to give the
impression that you have

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.650 align:middle line:90%
a small waist and a big back.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.415 align:middle line:90%
Your lats to right here.

00:47:54.415 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so they come all
the way down your back

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:84%
like this, right,
and they come down.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you take a big
breath and you fill it up,

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.810 align:middle line:84%
you can feel this muscle,
right, kind of start

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to engage and poke out.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
trying to look for.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same thing
here with your bicep.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see lots
of bodybuilders

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.545 align:middle line:84%
do this little hand
thing, because that

00:48:15.545 --> 00:48:17.760 align:middle line:84%
helps them kind of flex
it a little bit more.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
If you suck in and
pull up-- yeah,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.880 align:middle line:84%
can you make your belly
button come up a little bit?

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That about it.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:90%
But all of that popped.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.150 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.560 align:middle line:84%
All your little scalenes
went pop, pop, pop.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.770 align:middle line:90%
And you can see--

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.290 align:middle line:84%
where am I at-- you can
see your line down here

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.030 align:middle line:90%
as it starts to come in.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.840 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.320 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.445 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that definition?

00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:40.236 align:middle line:90%
And that one?

00:48:40.236 --> 00:48:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, we're going to have
a pose down right now.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.482 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:45.482 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for this?

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready for this.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's walk in.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.362 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:53.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.854 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.854 --> 00:48:57.654 align:middle line:90%
Biceps.

00:48:57.654 --> 00:49:01.526 align:middle line:90%


00:49:01.526 --> 00:49:02.847 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:49:02.847 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And then turn to the side.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.120 align:middle line:90%
And then turn all the way back.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Do your back with no arms.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into it.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Remember, just open that up.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Open that up.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Now bring your biceps up.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And then let's turn all the
way to the other side again.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Find that triceps.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And roll it back.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Smile at the judges.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a girl,
you'll be like, hey.

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a guy,
you'd be like, what up.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And then you'd walk off stage.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:47.685 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:50.595 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:50.595 --> 00:49:56.802 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.802 --> 00:49:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> My food portion since the
beginning of this project have

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.060 align:middle line:90%
shrunk.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding that it
takes a lot less food

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to keep me fueled
throughout the day.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:90%
And this happened naturally.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't force myself
to eat smaller meals.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I've also learned that
it's just as important

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:90%
when you eat as what you eat.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I eat a solid breakfast.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I eat a snack in between
breakfast and lunch.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Most days, I'll eat two
lunches, a couple hours

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.760 align:middle line:84%
apart because that enables
me to shrink my portion size.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.063 align:middle line:90%
Then I eat another snack.

00:50:26.063 --> 00:50:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And then I eat dinner.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.580 align:middle line:84%
On top of eating
really healthy food,

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I've drastically
changed the timing

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:90%
of when my meals hit my body.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And that has been an
incredible thing to witness.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:84%
The energy levels
are incredible.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel light
on my feet all the time.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I never have that
feeling of heaviness.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And I always have this
feeling that I could just

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:90%
get up and run.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And that feels good.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.260 align:middle line:84%
As far as the workouts
themselves are concerned,

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I noticed a shift at the
beginning of the month.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.030 align:middle line:84%
At the start of
this month, there

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:00.550 align:middle line:84%
were still days when
I had to kind of drag

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:90%
my heels a little bit.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.290 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't always pleasant.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And then something happened.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.553 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're my
favorite part of the day.

00:51:07.553 --> 00:51:09.470 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, when
I started this project,

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.095 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
it takes to get abs.

00:51:12.095 --> 00:51:13.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
making this movie.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find out.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out,
it's a lot easier

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.310 align:middle line:90%
than I thought initially.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:84%
My initial thoughts
and concerns were

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.318 align:middle line:84%
that I'd have to be
exercising five hours a day,

00:51:24.318 --> 00:51:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and then it would be
unpleasant and that I'd have

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to eat highly restrictive diet.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But the recipe for abs
is actually quite simple.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The recipe for abs is a good
diet plus good program design

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.760 align:middle line:90%
and consistency.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Good program design
in my opinion

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.820 align:middle line:84%
is first and foremost
something that's

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:90%
fun, that you enjoy doing.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
functional fitness.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not just lifting
weights in one fashion.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm lifting weights
in a way that I'm

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.510 align:middle line:84%
using stabilizing
muscles, and I will

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.880 align:middle line:84%
be able to apply those
exercises into real life.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I do yoga
ball work or bosu ball work,

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm using stabilizing
muscles in my core

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that I can then use
when I go surfing.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.465 align:middle line:84%
It's exercising that
helps the real world.

00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important to find stuff

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.990 align:middle line:90%
that you're excited about.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.520 align:middle line:90%
John helps me do core work.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.480 align:middle line:90%
He makes it fun.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not just doing
sit-ups, boring sit-ups.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.410 align:middle line:90%
He makes everything fun.

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:84%
We do a lot of
different exercises.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:90%
That keeps me engaged.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I found Nic.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.070 align:middle line:90%
He teaches kettlebells.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Kettlebells add an element
of danger into my workouts,

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because obviously you have
this big heavy kettlebell.

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
mindful and not drop it

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:90%
on your foot or your face.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually find that with
kettlebells, I work out

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so focused on being
careful that the workout can

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:90%
just run by quickly.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
notice the time fly by.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So good program design
for me is functional

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.820 align:middle line:84%
fitness and to find
things that you enjoy.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.110 align:middle line:90%
We all have big egos.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We all want to grab
the big weights.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We get to the gym,
and it's like, I'm not

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.000 align:middle line:84%
going to grab the 10 pounders,
I want the 30 pounders.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the zone
where you get hurt.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you get hurt, you
can't keep doing workouts.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep
working on your body.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that
John has been very

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.220 align:middle line:84%
helpful in helping me
understand is that it's

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.350 align:middle line:90%
important to start light.

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning
of this experiment,

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.520 align:middle line:84%
he would give me 10
or 12 pound weights.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be doing
curls or butterflies.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, thank
God, I'm in this gym

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.260 align:middle line:84%
alone because this
is embarrassing.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But the thing
about it is that it

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:90%
built my muscles incrementally.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm at the point where
I'm using 30 pound weights.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And not only does it not feel
heavy, but it feels safe.

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.860 align:middle line:84%
My body can accommodate
that weight.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And building off that, I think
it's important in the beginning

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to have a personal trainer
because a personal trainer

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.290 align:middle line:90%
adds a level of accountability.

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I noticed for myself, it's a lot
harder to do something for me

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.450 align:middle line:90%
than it is for somebody else.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when I know
that John is coming,

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.320 align:middle line:84%
when I know that I've
paid John for my workout,

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I sort of have no
choice but to go.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Hiring a trainer isn't cost
effective for everybody.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it is a very
good tool in the beginning,

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.810 align:middle line:84%
because it makes you
go to the workouts,

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and it helps you form
that healthy pattern.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:84%
On that note of having
a personal trainer,

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:84%
it's also worth mentioning
that it's very difficult

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to find a good trainer.

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely imperative
that you find a good trainer.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.370 align:middle line:84%
When you choose a
personal trainer,

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.050 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you
interview them.

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Ask them specific questions
based off the results

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that you want to attain.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.082 align:middle line:84%
Like are you confident
that I'm going to have abs?

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Or are you confident
that I'm going

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.500 align:middle line:90%
to build upper body strength?

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And based off how
they respond, you'll

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.010 align:middle line:84%
know if they're the right
trainer or the wrong trainer

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:53.810 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:57.110 align:middle line:84%
My friends were concerned
that this project was

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:58.910 align:middle line:84%
driven by vanity and
that I would become

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.550 align:middle line:90%
more vain the fitter I got.

00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But I've actually learned
that the opposite is true.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Before when I was a little
bit overweight, was pudgy,

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I found that I was constantly
stressed and concerned

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:10.963 align:middle line:90%
with how I looked.

00:55:10.963 --> 00:55:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I was always looking
in the mirror

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that
my hair looked good,

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that I was wearing clothes
that concealed my shape.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It was like a perpetual thing.

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I was always like, don't
take pictures of me.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Or do I look good
in that picture?

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now, I look in the
mirror and my reflection that's

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.640 align:middle line:84%
looking back at me is
an awesome reflection.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I find that I'm just
so much less stressed.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to just
go on with my day,

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not concerned
about any of it.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what I'm
wearing, where I'm going,

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.910 align:middle line:90%
who's taking pictures of me.

It just expanded
its organic section.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.290 align:middle line:84%

place to come and buy

upon thousands of dollars.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So when I come to
a place like this,

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:28.880 align:middle line:84%
it's an easy way to
get really good food

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.788 align:middle line:90%

good strategy for next time

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:27.370 align:middle line:84%
would be to wear some Bluetooth

a health food store

of consistent training,

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
my coach John suggested that I
put my fitness to the ultimate

test by competing
in a triathlon.

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other races, triathlons
require participants

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to swim, bike, and
run, thus challenging

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.570 align:middle line:90%
every muscle in the body.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%

let alone a triathlon.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%

from John, I agreed to try it.

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%

than I could have ever expected.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the last leg of the race when
I was no longer passing people.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking, man,
the guy in front of me

I don't think I'll
be able to catch him.

to lose weight,
you have to fast.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%

a very common belief.

the last four months

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is that this belief isn't
necessarily true, because I

over unhealthy habits is an
act of true love to yourself.

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I choose to
eat healthy food, when

01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I choose to go to
the gym regularly,

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving myself
a big, big hug.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually doing something
very pleasant, very

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:54.950 align:middle line:90%
loving for myself, for my body.

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And that, that in and
of itself, that choice

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to do something
healthy repeatedly

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is how I lift my
own self-esteem.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was going
into this project,

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I had pretty big expectations.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
My expectations
initially were that I

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
was going to get really fit,
that I would start noticing

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
more definition right away.

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had a little bit of
a freak out a month or two

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
in when I'd been working
out for a solid 30, 40 days

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and I started feeling stronger
but nothing was changing.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I was still kind of
pudgy in the gut.

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have as much
definition in the arms

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.370 align:middle line:90%
as I would have wanted to.

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had this mini panic, like
the 3-month mark is coming up.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to have figured
some stuff out by now,

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.730 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not.

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it working?

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And so then I had a
meeting with my film crew.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to extend the
project for another month,

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
make it four months
instead of three.

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
the third month

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that I really started
noticing the difference.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The fat really started melting,
that the muscle definition

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.560 align:middle line:90%
started showing up.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I had these expectations
for fast results.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.705 align:middle line:84%
And instead what I got was
slow and steady results.

01:07:58.705 --> 01:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's very important

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to mention I think because
often people will start

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.710 align:middle line:90%
going to the gym in January.

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:06.660 align:middle line:90%
It's called the January effect.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And they have all this
desire to live a better year.

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
New Year's resolutions.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And a month into it, when
they don't see any results,

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
they all quit.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.729 align:middle line:84%
Had those people not
quit on the first,

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
but taken it another
month, month and a half,

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that's when the results
start showing up.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much more gradual
process unfortunately.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:33.430 align:middle line:90%
But, you know what?

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:34.720 align:middle line:90%
What's the rush?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Once you get fit,
you can maintain it

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.180 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.305 align:middle line:90%
It's not really a race.

01:08:40.305 --> 01:08:41.105 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the process.

01:08:41.105 --> 01:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%

01:08:49.388 --> 01:09:09.319 align:middle line:90%


01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:13.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Four months ago, being
fit was no more than a dream.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.149 align:middle line:84%
It seemed impossible and
completely out of my reach.

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
At the start of this project,
the title of this movie,

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
"I Want Abs," described my most
honest desire to get in shape

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and figure out if the
effort was worth it.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.609 align:middle line:84%
Today, I can attest that
the effort is worth it.

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:31.225 align:middle line:84%
During the making
of this film, I

01:09:31.225 --> 01:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
learned that the
process of getting fit

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
was much easier than I expected
and that the lifestyle change

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
was a pleasant one.

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:40.399 align:middle line:84%
The transformation of
my body was accompanied

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
by elevated self-esteem,
stronger willpower, and a lot

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.529 align:middle line:90%
more happiness.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Walking through
life in a fit body

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:49.069 align:middle line:84%
is a completely
different experience

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:51.229 align:middle line:84%
than in a body
that's out of shape.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely awesome.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And I highly recommend it.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel alert and ready for
whatever life throws my way.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
incredible feeling.

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So what's the secret
to getting abs?

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
One hour of vigorous exercise
three to five times per week,

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
eating six small meals that
consist of healthy ingredients

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
daily, not eating late at
night and being consistent.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.560 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.030 align:middle line:84%
This project helped
me to realize

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that it's just as difficult and
expensive to get out of shape

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
as it is to get in shape.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
In order to get
out of shape, one

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
must regularly purchase cookies
and other expensive junk foods,

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
spend countless tedious
hours in sedentary poses,

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and put up with all the physical
and emotional limitations

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%
of such a lifestyle.

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, being fit requires
a trainer, a gym membership,

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and time to achieve results.

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But unlike being out of
shape, the side effects

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of living a healthy
lifestyle are only positive.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Any one person is
only 20, 40, or 100

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:53.055 align:middle line:84%
workouts away from being in
the best shape of their lives.

01:10:53.055 --> 01:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to live
those days anyway.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So why not invest into a
better future for yourself?

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's daunting to start and
the results show up gradually.

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why I encourage you to
enjoy the process and trust

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%
that you'll get there.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.712 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
don't stop.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we're heading
to The Flat Top,

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going
to finally shave.

01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I've been wearing a beard
for quite a long time.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
At the start of the
movie, I told you

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that I was growing
out of a beard

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to show progression and time.

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm going full circle.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I have abs.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I have a beard.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.280 align:middle line:90%
And I want my face back.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I've recruited three
friends who are

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
going to help me pick a
new facial hair style.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.710 align:middle line:90%
So this is the beard cut.

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:12:21.574 --> 01:12:25.060 align:middle line:90%

>> Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Sit down, you guys.

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:32.370 align:middle line:90%
