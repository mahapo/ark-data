00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:90%
so who sees, then?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Does the brain see
or do the eyes see?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:90%

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%

what it sees in its environment

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%

that I believe is true

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
is that when the Indians,
the Native American Indians,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
on the Caribbean islands saw
Columbus' ships approaching,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't see
them at all because it

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:84%
was so unlike anything
they had ever seen before.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't see it.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>When Columbus' armada
landed in the Caribbean,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
none of the natives were
able to see the ships,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
even though they
existed on the horizon.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The reason that they
never saw the ships

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:84%
was because they
had no knowledge

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
in their brains or no experience
that clipper ships existed.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%

that there is ripples out

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean, but
he sees no ship.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%

what's causing the effect.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%

looks and looks and looks.

he's able to see the ships.

he tells everybody else

the question immediately

becomes, who what chooses

must be involved.

00:35:58.965 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
They write an intention

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.360 align:middle line:90%

And it really comes
down to the fact

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%

It's a wonderful idea
of positive thinking,

00:36:31.115 --> 00:36:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but what it usually
means is that I

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:84%
have a little smear of
positive thinking covering

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the whole mass of
negative thinking.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So thinking positive is not
really thinking positive,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
it's just disguising the
negative thinking that we have.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>When we think
of things, then we

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:84%

concrete than it is.

I cannot really change it.

But if reality is
my possibility,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
possibility of consciousness
itself, then, immediately

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:84%
comes the question of
how can I change it, how

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
can I make it better, how
can I make it happier?

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
You see, how we had extending
the image of ourselves?

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:84%
In the old thinking, I
cannot change anything,

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
because I don't have any
role at all in reality.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Reality is already there.

It's material objects
moving in their own way

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.890 align:middle line:84%
from deterministic
laws, and mathematics

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.907 align:middle line:84%

do in a given situation.

00:37:34.907 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I, the experience I
have no role at all.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
In the new view, yes,
mathematics can give us

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
something, it gives us the
possibilities that all these

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
movements can assume, but
it cannot give us the actual

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:84%
experience that I'll be
having in my consciousness.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I chose that experience.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.535 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, literally,
I create my own reality.

In the hypothalamus, we take
small-chain proteins called

experience that emotional state

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in our body or in our

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:37.670 align:middle line:84%
will immediately
assemble the peptide.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It then releases it through the
pituitary into the bloodstream.

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The moment it makes it
into the bloodstream,

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.970 align:middle line:84%
it finds its way to

>>I actually got very interested
in studying this whole topic

01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:31.138 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and
spirituality because it

01:41:31.138 --> 01:41:32.680 align:middle line:84%
had to do with a
lot of the questions

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:35.590 align:middle line:84%
that I was asking ever since
I was a child, about reality

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and how we understood
truth and what was real.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And as I grew up, and
as I realized that,

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.840 align:middle line:84%
while spirituality
was in some senses

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
a very important part of
trying to find those answers,

01:41:46.190 --> 01:41:48.430 align:middle line:84%
science also was a
very crucial part.

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was ultimately looking for
some way of bringing those two

01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:53.150 align:middle line:90%
forces together.

01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a professor
at Georgetown,

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.982 align:middle line:90%
in the medical school.

>>Here we are actually

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this room
is a great thinker,

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.980 align:middle line:84%
now that we've
got them thinking.

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.470 align:middle line:90%
That's always a trick, isn't it?

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>I should make
it clear that I'm

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
a graduate student in physics.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a full-fledged
theoretical physicist yet.

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But if fortune smiles on me and
I continue to work like a dog

on my problem sets
and exams and whatnot,

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.250 align:middle line:84%
eventually what I
hope to do with this

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:42.475 align:middle line:84%
is to apply fundamental quantum
theory to quantum information

01:42:42.475 --> 01:42:43.275 align:middle line:90%

01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>So I decided, well, if I gave
up being department chairman,

01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and if I gave up all my
professional committees,

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and I gave up all my
government committees,

01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I would have a block of time
that I could put to work.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I give up
all my power positions.

01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
sacrifice something.

01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:07.123 align:middle line:84%
I had to keep my day job because
my family needed to be fed.

>>I presume that
you're asking me

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.990 align:middle line:84%
how a scientist can sound
this wacko because I

01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:20.593 align:middle line:90%
must be sounding wacko.

01:43:20.593 --> 01:43:24.820 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] It's really
an interesting question.

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:29.090 align:middle line:84%
If you study science long
enough and seriously enough

01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and dig deeply enough,
if you don't come out

01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:36.357 align:middle line:84%
feeling wacko about it, you
haven't understood a thing.
