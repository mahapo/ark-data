>>Throughout mankind's
history, all across the globe,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
there has been an
awareness of something

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:90%
more than our everyday reality.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Hidden worlds, other
dimensions, spiritual planes--

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
call it what you
like, each culture

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
has their own interpretation
of this concept, the concept

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
of a reality that is
beyond our five senses,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:84%
yet still has a profound impact
on our known physical world

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and existence.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.845 align:middle line:84%
Could there be truth
behind this idea?

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:25.795 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:10%
>>Outside of the
visible universe,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:10%
which we can see
such a tiny part of,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.465 align:middle line:10%
are vast dimensions over
and above this plane.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>>Our journey is to
make known the unknown.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:10%
That's the simple imperative.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>>I would say that
what is happening

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.345 align:middle line:10%
is we increase our awareness.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:10%
>>Is the reality that we can see
and feel and measure and hear

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:10%
and touch and all of
that, is that all?

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:10%
Or is there more to it?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:90%

>>I think if we really
listened with the heart

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:10%
and we learned to
see more, see beyond.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:10%
>>If someone thinks they
know how reality works,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.297 align:middle line:10%
it's simply because they
don't have enough information.

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Why have we decided that
there are only five senses?

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>>As we expand in
consciousness, we

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:10%
become aware that there's
more to us and the universe

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:10%
that we live in than
anybody would comprehend

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.105 align:middle line:10%
or even fathom.

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>>We're going from three
dimensional reality

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:10%
into multiple dimensions.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:10%
And it's just another step.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:10%
It's always there.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:10%
It's always existed.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:10%
And now we're
becoming aware of it.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:10%
>>When it first started with the
big bang, 13 billion years ago,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:10%
there was already an
enormous consciousness

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:10%
in that act that had all
the potentiality in it that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:10%
would allow the physical to
evolve into what it is now.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:10%
>>For centuries upon
centuries, the human race

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:10%
has existed in this hypnotic
state, a trance state

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:10%
I call it, of believing we're
the center of everything.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:10%
>>When Columbus discovered
America, as we say--

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.455 align:middle line:10%
we know now that he did
not discover America--

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:10%
but when he came
to America in 1492.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And thinking about how much--
there were people who said,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:90%
no, the Earth is flat.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you sail
in that direction,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
fall off the edge.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a two dimensional
world back then.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
people believed in.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>>If you're a bug
in a piece of paper,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:10%
you're aware of this direction
and this direction, two

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:10%
dimensions.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:10%
Yes?

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you're a
rabbit, jumping around.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.786 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of
three dimensions.

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:90%
The human is aware also of time.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:90%
We can plan ahead.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
Animals seem to be living
in the moment all the time.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like,
when you graduate

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
from where you are
and look further,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
you have access to
another dimension.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what seems
to be happening.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:10%
>>All cultures around the
world have their own concept

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:10%
of other dimensions, heaven
and hell, higher planes,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:10%
Bardos of the Buddhists.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous cultures
all have a concept

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.029 align:middle line:84%
of other realms,
other dimensions.

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>What could happen if you
look even through the Hubble

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
telescope and see
the range of what's

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
there, even in the
visible universe,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.241 align:middle line:84%
within that narrow
slot that we can see?

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
What's in the
invisible universe,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:90%
which is equally real.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:10%
>>We know very little
about who we are.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We know very little about
how our brain works,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
how our body works, and how we
create the nature of reality.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't even really know what
the word consciousness means.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:10%
>>Culturally, we're
misinformed and uneducated

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:10%
about other realms
and other dimensions.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.735 align:middle line:10%
In our world, they're made
into fantasies or demonized.

00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:10%
This is probably why we have
such a hard time understanding

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:10%
these spheres of
light, called orbs,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:10%
that are appearing in people's
photographs all over the world.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Our appreciation,
our awareness

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the paranormal
or the occult, worse again,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
has been shaped by Hollywood and
Halloween hauntings and ghouls

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and vampires and fearsome
extraterrestrials oozing slime.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we think of
the paranormal or the realms

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:90%
of reality outside of ours.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's the worst
possible preparation

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that we could have
for understanding

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
what the phenomenon
of orbs has to tell us

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>These lights have
always been here.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They were painted in the
Renaissance, 1700s, 1800s.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:90%
They were called cherubs.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:90%
They were called pootie.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the more
traditional sense,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
they're called orbs, because
we don't see them with wings.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The Renaissance painters, and
those people who saw them,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
painted wings only because
they flew through the air.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way
to capture, in art,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
the aerodynamic
levitational quality

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:90%
of a brilliant presence.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>>As far as light
spheres or orbs,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:10%
they're throughout history.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're in paintings,
they're in frescoes.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>If you go to Europe and
see all those old paintings

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
of the saints with the
circles around their head,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I have orbs like that.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I have taken pictures of
orbs around a person's head

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:90%
that look very similar to that.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe they were very
perceptive at that time,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't need
cameras to see it.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>When you compare historical
art images to orb photographs,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.025 align:middle line:84%
some of the similarities
are quite remarkable.

00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:84%
>>Artists are always people
with heightened sensitivity.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that, when you
look at early paintings,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.745 align:middle line:84%
either they are painting
things that they actually saw

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
or they are symbolically
conveying a higher

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
truth that they
were experiencing.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Our technology has developed
a tool, the digital camera,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that allows all of us
to be visionary artists

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and see past the veil that
separates the dimensions.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>But if these alternative
planes of reality exist,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
what is it that
keeps them separate

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:90%
from our everyday reality?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it some kind of
dimensional fog,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic veil obscuring
hidden truths?

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And what if that
veil began to lift?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:90%
What would we experience?

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:10%
>>I had had pictures of
orbs using a regular film

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:10%
camera for many years before.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:10%
I remember I took
some in Spain, which

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:10%
I have looked back at now.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And there they are, you
know, bright and clear orbs.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
Even though, at
that time, I thought

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
it was some camera or
photoelectric effect

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't familiar with.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's not the
amassing of a big collection

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
of pictures, but
what this tells us

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
universe in which we live.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
My entire life
has been searching

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
for what I can find out about
the truth concerning reality.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And if someone said, it's
very strange for a person

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
with your background to
be where you are now.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say, it's not
in the least strange

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
if you understand that what
I was always searching for,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to the best of my
ability, was the truth.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.274 align:middle line:10%
>>When I first discovered orbs,
it was at Sattva Sanctuary.

00:09:30.274 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
While we were there,
people were getting

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.815 align:middle line:84%
things on their digital
camera that I'd never

00:09:33.815 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
seen before, these
balls of light.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
We took the family
back to experiment.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So the four of us were
standing out in the field.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And at first, there was nothing.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.992 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly, in the
next shot, the orbs

00:09:44.992 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:90%
were pouring in all over us.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%
We were surrounded by orbs.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
When we first
discovered the orbs,

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed, delighted, and
frightened at the same time.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I had
reality figured out.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
At my age, you kind of think
you've put it together.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I had to open my worldview

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to this whole new paradigm,
that we were living side

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
by side with these
other dimensions.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
After taking several
hundred orb pictures,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
suddenly this mist
or plasma started

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
showing up on the camera.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The mist seems like it's
made up of small orbs that

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
are all grouped together.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
As a photographer,
the orb phenomenon

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:90%
has been truly amazing.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to setting
up a composition

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's going
to be in a photograph.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly with the
orbs, I was setting up

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
a composition and co-creating
inter-dimensional art.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm a musician, an
artist, so, to me,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:10%
everything is harmony
and patterns and cycles.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
When I first discovered orbs,
I was playing a concert.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was really odd, because
the crowd wasn't that big,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
but it felt like there were
so many more people there.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, subjectively,
like I was in an amphitheater.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when I saw the
pictures people were taking,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:90%
we were flooded with orbs.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:84%
There were many, many
somethings there with me.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Around that time, we went to a
tree down by the Columbia River

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.582 align:middle line:84%
that people told us had
very special energy.

00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And a picture was
taken of my son, Seth.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
We asked him what he was
thinking at this moment, when

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
this light bulb went
off over his head,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and he said he was wondering
if this stuff could be real

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and if it could have
anything to do with him.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The feeling when the orbs
come in, it's very familiar.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
see a beautiful sunset

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
or you have a moment
of inspiration

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
or when you have a peak
moment in your meditation.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.893 align:middle line:10%
>>My background is
with the dolphins.

00:11:47.893 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:10%
I am actually a psychologist.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's helped me
a lot in communicating

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:90%
with dolphins and whales.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And because I've been swimming
with them for over 25 years,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I have learned so
many things from them.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is probably
the first place

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
where I saw the
orbs, in the ocean.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
phenomena in the ocean,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
because you can see orbs
better than in the air.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins remind me, and
all of those swimming with me,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that there are many things that
we cannot always see but that

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:10%
>>I always saw
lights, even when I

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:10%
was a little girl in the
cotton fields of New Mexico.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Most children do see them.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And most children are very
comfortable with seeing

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:90%
these lights.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the-- it's the adults
that grow out of seeing them.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:10%
>>All of this, really, is done
together with my wife, Gundi.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Gundi and I got a call one day
from our spiritual teacher,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:10%
whether we would shoot some
pictures at his upcoming event.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And that evening, when I
downloaded the pictures

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
into my computer, I
discovered that there

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
was something in
the pictures that

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:90%
didn't make any sense to me.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a light bulb.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I looked at this thing.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't make any sense
out it whatsoever.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, maybe
there was something.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I literally went down to
the ballroom of that conference

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:90%
center and looked at it.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
There was absolutely nothing
that I could think of--

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and decided there has
to be something to it.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>>As Klaus mentioned
before, we had the privilege

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:10%
of being volunteer
photographers quite a few times.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
we discovered orbs.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the photography became
even more exciting for me.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I immediately saw
beautiful mandalas in those

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
orbs.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you enlarge the
circle, you see the interiority

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.245 align:middle line:84%
and there are beautiful symbols
in them in different colors.

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I was just absolutely
fascinated,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't get enough
of taking more pictures.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And I feel very lucky to
be married to a scientist.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
He understands energy from
a different perspective.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I just feel it and
sense it and know

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
it to be true and know
it to be effective.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And he can add some
explanations to it.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I know the moment we saw these
beautiful designs out there,

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
there is a meaning.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:90%
We can discover it.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.165 align:middle line:84%
>>Could there really
be invisible spheres

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:84%
of light floating all around us
that we are somehow now seeing

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:90%
with our technology?

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
How could something like that
be scientifically possible?

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:10%
>>The real purpose
of science is to move

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:10%
us step by step towards a deeper
understanding of our universe.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>>For a long time,
in physics, we

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:10%
have believed that
the speed of light

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:10%
is the veil, is the
end of everything.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the fastest there is.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing
faster than that.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It is now very clear
to notable physicists

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that the speed of light
is not at all the barrier,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's not at all the
veil, that there is more,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and that, in fact, there is
a continuum of our reality

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that goes way beyond
the speed of light.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that
which we intuitively

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
call the spiritual
reality is probably

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the one that starts
at the speed of light

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and goes way beyond,
orders of magnitude greater

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.277 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:10%
>>You have to have an
inter-dimensional mind

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:10%
to do this kind of research.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to do
it with physical objects,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:10%
because you're having a
non-physical experience.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.435 align:middle line:84%
>>The true thinkers imagined,
in their thought experiments--

00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Einstein had
thought experiments.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:90%
He didn't work in a laboratory.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:10%
>>It always occurred to me
that it was extremely strange

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:10%
that we regard
what we see, which

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:10%
is a very narrow range of
the visible light spectrum,

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:10%
and everything outside
of that is somehow

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:10%
regarded as preternatural or
supernatural or paranormal

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:10%
or any of these labels just
because we can't see it.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>>To expect to see
it, to believe it,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:10%
is you would be missing
99.9% of reality.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>We live in a seeing
is believing culture.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And now that we can actually
photograph other dimensions

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and see them, will
people believe?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>All the cutting edge
scientists, right now,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are coming to the
same conclusion,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
that we live in this sea of
consciousness and everything

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:90%
is connected.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It's this quantum field.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Science, at its
heart, was endeavoring

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to explain the wonderful world,
the wonderful realm that we

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
live in-- and to
explain it in ways

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:90%
that people can understand.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.889 align:middle line:84%
So there's no longer
superstition about the sun,

00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, that we were
actually going around it

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:90%
instead of it going around us.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the unseen has got
a big boost in recent years

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
because out of the
unseen, now, in our time,

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
has come nuclear radiation,
x-rays, et cetera-- stuff that

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:90%
can kill us out of the unseen.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
a thing is unseen

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is no longer the
same as saying it's

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:90%
irrelevant or not important.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>I was trying to make a
bridge between the scientific

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Making this kind of a
bridge, as a scientist,

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
has been my preoccupation
for a long time.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And the orbs fit very well
into that whole effort.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they became the
main focus of this effort.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Definitely, we
should study them.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.435 align:middle line:84%
We should study
them scientifically.

00:17:57.435 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And we should study them with
the head, right, but also

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:90%
with our hearts.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The orbs kind of forces
us, forces our scientists

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
to do it not just with
instruments but to do it

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
with their feelings as well, so
forcing us to be more complete,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:90%
a better human being.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>My eye takes in all of this.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The brain filters out 90% of
it, and I see a small fraction,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the fraction that's important
for me to live my life today.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.567 align:middle line:84%
Now orbs don't usually
fit into that slot.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't need orbs, you
know, to pay our mortgages

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
or take our children
to school or daycare.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.824 align:middle line:84%
>>I've even had people--
I'll be pointing,

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, look, there's
the dolphins out there

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Can you see them?

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
They're, they're
in the distance.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:10%
They're coming toward us.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:10%
And people cannot see them.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see them.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And often that's because
they're not used to seeing them.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what they
look like in the ocean yet.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And so they don't see them.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But once they learn
about them and begin

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to open their
awareness to dolphins,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
then they see them
more and more.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing with
these spheres of light.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>My working hypothesis is
that they move extremely fast,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that they're all around, that
they're not just one or two,

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
but there may be
many, hundreds of them

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
all around us, all the
time, except that they

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
are moving so fast that
nobody is seeing them.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Your eye, by the way,
sees them all around you.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a lens on a camera.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It's your brain
that's not seeing it.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to science
and technology,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
we have sophisticated
equipment that we can actually

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
see this marvelous
dimension that's around us

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and open ourselves up to a
new realm and a new future.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a lot of people
who are absolutely, totally

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
convinced that what
they can see is

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
all there is, what they can
measure is all there is.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>There have always
been skeptics.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And isn't that wonderful?

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Because skeptics honor everyone
by having people define

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
if this is a belief system
or this is a true experience.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>At first I thought
that the orbs were

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
water drops in the air
and somehow the flash

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:90%
will produce them, like a lens.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:90%
But then that didn't work.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I took
pictures in the rain,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you see the drops
falling but not orbs.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.425 align:middle line:84%
And then I got orbs
during the summer,

00:20:34.425 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
where it's very, very dry
here in Northern California.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>When I discovered
the orb phenomenon,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I took my photographs
and wanted everyone

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to see how exciting
it was that we can now

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
photograph other dimensions.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that, if someone is
not ready to open themselves up

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
to this, all the photographs in
the world won't convince them.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I think, for the first
time, we can really

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
see clear-cut evidence that
is very difficult to refute.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously,
there are people who

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
try to refute that and who say
that orbs are just diffraction

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, dust particles,
or water droplets

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:90%
or whatever might be in the air.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
There are skeptics.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why I then devoted
a lot of time and research

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:10%
into this subject area to make
sure that I was on solid ground

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:10%
and not dealing with easily
explainable phenomena.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:10%
>>The obvious objection
that most skeptics make

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:10%
is that these are dust
or water particles that

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:10%
are very close to the
lens reflecting light

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:10%
from the flash.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:10%
The problem with this is,
if you do this deliberately,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:10%
these are always blurry,
indistinct little blobs

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and really look
nothing like true orbs.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
True orbs, in focus, have a
very complex pattern in them.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And they look the
same, regardless

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of environmental conditions.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Dry, dusty, wet-- the
orbs look the same.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.765 align:middle line:84%
>>So I looked into all the
possibilities, that it was dust

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
or it was rain or
it was pollen or it

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
was insects and all
the different things.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And I just wasn't
convinced that that's

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.922 align:middle line:84%
what it is, because I have
seen orbs in so many locations,

00:22:27.922 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
in so many different
circumstances.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Obviously, Joan Ocean, she
took orb images underwater.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That would be very
hard to refute.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Some people are
so reluctant to move

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that I've been accused
of faking them.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm flattered ecause
it would imply

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge of
digital photography

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
which, unfortunately,
I don't possess.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.172 align:middle line:84%
>>We all know that there are
counterfeit $20 bills around.

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
they are around

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that the
$20 bill in your pocket

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%
is not worth $20.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
way we have to look at it.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Miceal Ledwith,
alone, has a collection

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:90%
of well over 100,000 orb images.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>You can catch them in motion.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you do
calculations, you'll

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
find they are moving
extremely fast

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to create that kind of a
smear during the short period

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of the flash or even the
period that the lens is open.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're generally
not drifting.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
They're moving up or
sideways, anything but down,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
the way particles would move.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>If you have consecutive images
that show a particular orb,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
with particular
features, and it shows

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
this orb in different
locations, in different images.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have series of pictures
where the orb actually

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
changes the size,
changes the rotation,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.141 align:middle line:84%
and the location in
subsequent images.

00:24:02.141 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
This could not be done
with a water droplet

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
or with a dust particle.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>After taking thousands of
photographs with orbs in them

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and seeing them relate
to people and energies,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
there's no doubt in my mind
that there's something to this.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Orb pictures, for the first
time, are real evidence.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They are not just
anecdotal evidence.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not just hearsay.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>To really investigate
this, if you're

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
really serious and
interested, you

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:84%
have to take many
photographs over time.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that
the true evidence

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:90%
may be somewhat subjective.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.127 align:middle line:84%
But as it builds up, it
becomes overwhelming.

00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean I've met a lot
of people who don't really

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
think that orbs are real.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they see one
on their own camera,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in their own pictures,
and that's all it takes.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Everybody who has
a digital camera

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:90%
can, in principle, see it.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.612 align:middle line:84%
So it opens up a
whole new chapter

00:25:01.612 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of our physical
confrontation with reality

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.695 align:middle line:84%
and our quest to know
more about that reality.

00:25:13.695 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>If orbs and other
dimensions really do exist,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.815 align:middle line:84%
what would be their
relevance to our lives?

00:25:22.815 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>I know, therefor, from
my investigation or orbs,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that I am living a
frequency based universe.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
The orbs vindicate that to me.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Every time I see them
or photograph them,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
in all their manifest
forms, it's a proof to me

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a
frequency based universe,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and the type of reality that
we experience every day depends

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
on how you and I are projecting
ourselves onto that universe.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>The more you meditate, the
more you focus on love and joy

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and bliss, your
frequencies move up.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The more your
frequencies move up,

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:84%
the more access you have
to these other planes

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And you start knowing from an
inner knowingness, a higher

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
consciousness and energy.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the whole
universe starts opening up.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>To me, the concept
of higher vibration

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
really means harmonized
or coherent vibration.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:10%
After all, the world
is a rich palette

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:10%
of vibrations and cycles.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's really about
finding harmony and balance

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:10%
between the elements.

>>Ron Roth is a noted
spiritual healer.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And so he would touch
people with his hands

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or he would just
doing movements.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:43.015 align:middle line:84%
And there, often orbs
show up right at his arm

00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that he uses for
healing or at his head.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.887 align:middle line:84%
>>Orbs are often seen
around energy healers.

00:26:50.887 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Are they coming because they're
attracted to the energy that's

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
being put out or are they
coming to help with the healing?

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a person whom
we know quite well, who

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is a very intuitive
Native American.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He did an experiment that
was absolutely phenomenal.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can
demonstrate to you

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that I can concentrate my
thought outside of my head.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able to
see it on the photograph.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, so
get your camera ready

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and I will tell you
when to shoot a picture.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a few seconds,
he said, now, take the picture.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And the picture shows a very
bright, orb-like feature

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.285 align:middle line:84%
right next to his head, where
he concentrated his thought

00:27:44.285 --> 00:27:44.785 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
At first, obviously,
if he can do that,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:84%
if he can concentrate
it here, he

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
can concentrate it in
between your hands.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:90%
He can concentrate it anywhere.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter how close.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Distance has no real
influence on that.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So this may have shed a
whole new set of lights

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
on the aspect of
distant healing,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:13.255 align:middle line:84%
of concentrating your thought
onto a person who may be sick

00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and may be in need of healing.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Here we have explanation
of how subtle energy

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:84%
healing really works and
even distant healing.

They can be in any
place, any time.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>My experience with orbs
has led me to the conclusion

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that things from our interior
world, that we may think

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:84%
are purely subjective-- our
inner voices, our subtle shifts

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of mood and emotion,
our guides, our angels--

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
these things really have an
effect on our exterior reality.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
They can exert a force on our
surroundings, on our existence,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes even
be photographed.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Moving the body
in sacred positions

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:90%
really encourages the orbs.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:middle line:84%
The more energy that we can
run through our physical body,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:90%
the more the orbs seem to come.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's dance
or yoga or Tai Chi,

>>The person is in
peace with themselves,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:90%
so they attract the orbs.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
When they meditate,
when they manage

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.265 align:middle line:84%
to quiet their inner selves
and they lower the RPMs,

00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:90%
the orbs come.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
When they play music-- see
music is very interesting.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Except for a few exceptions,
you don't play music for money.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You play music just for
yourself or to create

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
an atmosphere for
your friends as well.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:90%
So you're in a giving mode.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And that will attract the orbs.

the orbs, so do altars, sacred
spaces, sacred geometries

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.597 align:middle line:10%
and symbols.

00:29:54.597 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:10%
All these types of
things seem to have

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:10%
an attraction for the orbs.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I made this gong garden and some
of my sacred energy sculptures

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
primarily just to satisfy
my own creative impulse.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
However, it seems that the orbs
appreciate my efforts as well.

know that it's very
important for me

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to send out loving
energy because that's

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:90%
what attracts them.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Often, I'll sing or I'll tone.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, time and time again,
when Randy pulls out a flute

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.945 align:middle line:84%
and starts playing, the
orbs come in immediately.

00:30:28.945 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
The orbs love music.

>>We had a fabulous singer.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
seminar, Ron Roth thanked her.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:90%
And he took his arm around her.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And I took a picture of that.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was an orb
right at her mouth,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.247 align:middle line:90%
just perfectly located.

00:30:48.247 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%

Akbar Khan allowed

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
us to come to one of his classes
in North Indian classical music

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:90%

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
spheres, these energy
lights, these orbs

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and send them love
and ask them to come.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Say, please come.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like to, you
can hold out your hands,

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.200 align:middle line:84%
like that, and send
out energy toward them.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>When the orbs start
coming in and you see them

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
in the back of your camera,
there's nothing quite like it.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>In all the celebrations,
where we really

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.280 align:middle line:84%
took the most pictures,
there was time

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
taken to create this,
I would call it,

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.010 align:middle line:84%
sacred space that's
out here in nature,

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.380 align:middle line:90%
right now, very naturally.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But if we're in
our home building,

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we have to take
extra time to create it.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Children, especially,
are the ones

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the orbs are most
attracted to because they're

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.085 align:middle line:84%
innocent, and they're just in
that pure, blissful, no worries

00:35:52.085 --> 00:35:52.585 align:middle line:90%
mode.

00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>They do, in fact,
love children's energy

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and seem attracted
to animals as well.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that the orbs
come when I feel good.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm having a
good time, chances

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.442 align:middle line:90%
are there are orbs around.

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>If there's anything
that you need

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to do to see them
with your own camera,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or to catch them in your camera
if you will, what you do is,

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.465 align:middle line:84%
with your mind, tell
them, please hold still.

00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
be seen in my camera,

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
please hold still long enough
and beam into my camera.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.600 align:middle line:90%
And then they will do that.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds absolutely weird.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.030 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the way that
it appears to be.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:90%
That's my working hypothesis.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.918 align:middle line:84%
And this working hypothesis
hasn't been changed yet.

00:36:54.918 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I personally cannot see them,
but I do know several people

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.866 align:middle line:84%
who, apparently,
really can see an orb.

00:37:05.866 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell
me, now this one here

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:90%
came to rest right there.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Take a picture now.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Then they were there.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>The phenomena of orbs made
me realize that so often we

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:90%
focus on the physical.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking
at physical things.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at the camera.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at the scenery.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at the flowers.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we don't look at, very
often, is the space in between.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:90%
So I began looking at that.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I
found I could see orbs,

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.215 align:middle line:90%
if I practiced it.

00:37:38.215 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>The way your eyes are set
up, you see other dimensions

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.210 align:middle line:84%
out the side of your eyes,
the way your cones are set up.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But when you look directly
at it, you'll lose the focus.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.875 align:middle line:84%
So if you can train
yourself to look off

00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
to the side of what your
experiencing and not turn

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:84%
objectively and look straight
at it, you can see it.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.726 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.726 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Orbs can be used as an
opening to communicate

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:84%
with other realms
and dimensions.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even talking
off-planet, extraterrestrial.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking right here,
right now, all around us.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe in taking the
pictures on a regular basis,

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.160 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
every day, constantly,

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
not rushing out during the
breaks in the soap opera

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.230 align:middle line:84%
commercials and
taking, you know,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.595 align:middle line:84%
10 or 15 pictures and
then saying, oh, you know,

00:38:32.595 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I never saw anything worthwhile.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you decide to
commit yourself to this,

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and you take what's very little
problem for a digital camera,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:84%
100, 200 pictures a
night, say for an hour

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
or so, certain strange
things are going to happen,

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
wonderful things
are going to happen.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>With the attention
and intention

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that we, each time, before
such an event, express,

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.150 align:middle line:90%
they come more abundantly.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
we thought, well,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe it happens more
in this camera than

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in this camera and all these
typical questions that come up.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most important
thing is really the intention.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Try inviting them
to appear, politely.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You may feel ridiculous.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel absurd,
out there, with the camera,

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.376 align:middle line:84%
photographing the unseen
and start to giggle,

00:39:25.376 --> 00:39:27.875 align:middle line:84%
this is the type of energy that
will probably bring them in.

00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>I think this is really
the call for everyone,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.980 align:middle line:90%
just enjoy and find out.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.580 align:middle line:90%
They'll show up.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>In the past, you know, you
had to be a guru or a mystic

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.090 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of saint to be
able to see these things,

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
whereas now all you need to do
is buy a cheap digital camera.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>>When these
photographs were taken

00:39:53.375 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:84%
as a series of photographs
taken about three seconds apart,

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
I felt the most amazing
energy throbbing and pulsing

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt love, and I felt
connected to the universe.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the most remarkable
experience for me

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:90%
to have that documented.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I feel that all of us have
felt these moments, moments

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
when they were filled with
a vibrant, connected energy

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and all felt right and in
balance and in the flow.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.900 align:middle line:84%
The thing is we
usually don't have

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.025 align:middle line:90%
someone taking our picture.

00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>I suppose it was maybe a
year or two after I started

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:90%
taking the pictures of the orbs.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Certain extraordinary
phenomena started to occur.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't been
warned in advance,

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I might have been
scared at this point,

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:84%
because of the burdens of
superstition we all carry.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, you know, I used
to take the pictures at night

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.660 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like
all of us, the error

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of the tradition that the
supernatural and the paranormal

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:90%
occurs at night.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So here I was out at maybe
12:00 midnight or 2:00

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:90%
in the morning, pitch dark.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:90%
In midwinter this was.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
I took these pictures.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And the whole place
was full of orbs.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sort of
felt to myself,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm outnumbered here.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, you
almost feel, as they

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
say, like running in and pulling
the blanket over your head.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Though the protective effects
of a blanket have been vastly

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:90%
overrated.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I always felt that the orbs
were there for participation

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:90%
not observation.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I often included
myself in the pictures,

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:84%
even those there was
no one else there.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:90%
The camera was on automatic.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
I noticed that-- I'd

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
come back and check the
pictures periodically--

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:90%
that the orbs were breaking up.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
That they were
losing their form.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them
starting to rotate.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And it got faster
and faster and faster

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
till the orbs had
entirely lost their shape.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And then it formed
a sort of tunnel.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:10%
I thought that this was very
similar to some of the things

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.300 align:middle line:10%
that, say, a painter
like William Blake,

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:10%
in Victorian times, had
pictured, a vortex of faces

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and that, which must
be something related

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:10%
to the tunnel of light
that so many people who

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:10%
have had near death
experiences have talked about.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>In my experience
with orbs, I feel

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that they come from the
pool of consciousness,

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:84%
the great, great source
of all consciousness.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And they are here to let us
have access to that, to join us,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and to open us to that reality.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems to be related
to this spirit world,

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.900 align:middle line:84%
to the world that we cannot
see that has started unveiling.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>I've come to believe
that these orbs are

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.640 align:middle line:90%
conscious and loving beings.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But believe me,
I do not say this

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.780 align:middle line:84%
lightly nor without a lot
of intellectual torment

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and uncomfortable
paradigm shifts.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>They've shown
me a universe that

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.950 align:middle line:84%
is very different from
what I was taught.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.070 align:middle line:10%
Because they show me that there
are beings in other dimensions

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:10%
of frequency that I cannot see
or touch because I am at this

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:10%
frequency.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.340 align:middle line:84%
If I were at their
frequency, they

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.540 align:middle line:84%
would be as solid as this
ground I'm standing on.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>When they're in focus
and I blow them up,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:84%
they have a structure
like a cell.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
That reinforces the idea
that it's a living being.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:84%
If it was just a
ray of light, why

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:84%
it would have all these
intricate things inside?

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So it gives me the idea that
it's another form of life

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:90%
that we have yet to discover.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Orbs are consciousness, beings
that we haven't been trained

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to see or understand--
at least not yet.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:44:03.726 align:middle line:84%
>>I really think the spiritual
beings that are behind the orbs

00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:84%
are seeing that now we
have a technology where

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:90%
they can actually be seen.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
an orb picture, it

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.090 align:middle line:84%
is not because you were
able to do something.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It was because the orbs decided
to show up in your camera.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Contained within this ball
is consciousness and energy,

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.580 align:middle line:84%
ancient consciousness
and energy.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>We're constantly discovering
new species on this planet,

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.870 align:middle line:84%
so it should be no surprise
that there are other life

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.014 align:middle line:84%
forms inhabiting the invisible
parts of our universe.

00:44:38.014 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Like we use a microscope
to see the microbe,

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.810 align:middle line:84%
now we're using the
camera to discover

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:90%
these other forms of life.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these ones are
very different to ours.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they are ephemeral, they
only live for a short while.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Or perhaps they don't die.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:90%
They are there all the time.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>A sphere of energy
is a primal form,

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
one that we see many
times in nature--

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:84%
a drop of water,
the shape of a cell.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And this shape forms naturally
under many conditions

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.015 align:middle line:90%
and is easy to sustain.

00:45:08.015 --> 00:45:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a whole reality
of beings-- whatever

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.560 align:middle line:84%
they are-- that are
conscious, around us.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.010 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
is actually-- goes back

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to my spiritual
upbringing as a Christian.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And this brings a
whole new meaning

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.690 align:middle line:90%
into this saying in the Bible.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded by
a cloud of witnesses.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And it really is true.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:90%
We are actually surrounded.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't see them.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.283 align:middle line:84%
We don't see them because
they move so fast.

00:45:39.283 --> 00:45:42.670 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>There are so many myths and
legends throughout history

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.990 align:middle line:84%
depicting balls of
light, fairies, earth

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:90%
elementals, gnomes.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.335 align:middle line:84%
Could they have been
talking about orbs?

00:45:53.335 --> 00:45:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, angels always
was, for me, a familiar term.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But you never could put
your fingers on them.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:84%
You know they must be somewhere,
helping us and enveloping us

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:11.905 align:middle line:84%
in light and love and
hope and good feelings.

00:46:11.905 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But now, with these beautiful
pictures, it has become real.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you say these may
be angels or anything else,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.800 align:middle line:84%
maybe this is how
the belief in angels

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.700 align:middle line:84%
came about, because
people saw these things.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And maybe when they see
them as disincarnate spirits

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.490 align:middle line:84%
or something else, it's because
they saw these realities

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and put their own
stamp on what they

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:90%
realized that they might be.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>I think we're looking at a
whole ecosystem of the unseen,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.110 align:middle line:84%
which could include beings that
we traditionally, historically

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
have called fairies, gnomes,
elves, angels, ghosts, spirits,

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and many others things.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>The mystery of the orb
is the mystery of our self.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:02.630 align:middle line:84%
What they are is what we are
without the dressing of a body.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.320 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
when everybody dies,

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:11.230 align:middle line:84%
the last thing that leaves the
body is a rapid ball of light.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.430 align:middle line:84%
This rapid ball of
light is what we

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:84%
were from our very
roots and beginning.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Because what we are
is not the physical

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.440 align:middle line:84%
construct that we find
ourself in as humanity.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Our human construct
is a necessity

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to create in this
level of matter.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But what organizes matter,
what electrifies matter,

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:39.112 align:middle line:84%
the pulse of light, itself,
is that ball of light.

00:47:39.112 --> 00:47:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we are.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>From my understanding, we
are actually all orbs of light.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.980 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:90%
We are surrounded by light.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you would see the light
without our physical form

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:58.660 align:middle line:84%
or when the light is so bright,
we're like egg-shaped light.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:90%
And I have pictures of that.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
It shows up in the
ocean more, where

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:84%
you can see a light around
people who are swimming.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>These are beings--
they're slightly, slightly,

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:13.660 align:middle line:84%
not very much outside
of our present dimension

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, not
very much at all.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And they belong to a realm where
you and I have been many times.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>I like to think that, quite
a long time ago, perhaps when

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was first
populated, many,

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.830 align:middle line:84%
many beings came in
as thought forms.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.210 align:middle line:90%
That was our first reality.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
We were here as thought forms,
light, spheres of light.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, these
spheres of light

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
decided to try out physical
form and go back and forth.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And then many beings began
to remain in the physical

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and soon could no longer go back
into their light sphere form

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.210 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>But if we're asking--
brass tacks here,

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
cut to the chase--
what is an orb?

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:04.410 align:middle line:84%
It is what you and I are,
without the physical body.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And after we breathe
our last breath,

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:10.780 align:middle line:84%
we then become
what's there-- which

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.110 align:middle line:84%
is the greater part of this,
by the way-- an energy being,

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.360 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily powerful.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>In reference to,
then, children,

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
they see these because they have
a close memory of being them.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So their acceptance
is wide open.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.660 align:middle line:84%
As they turn into teenagers,
these sweet memories

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and these sweet
interactions of their mind

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:90%
begin to fade with time.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're only
recalled later in life.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Now the storm starts
in one's life,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and we sort of lose that
childhood experience,

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.835 align:middle line:84%
but we still are
what we were then.

00:49:47.835 --> 00:49:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Could the phenomenon
of orbs truly present

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.980 align:middle line:84%
a singular explanation for
what we think of as our souls,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics of
life after death,

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
guardian angels,

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and even the concept of a
collective consciousness?

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:84%
How could we have
been unaware of this?

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>There has been,
clearly, a veil

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:90%
in our perceiving of reality.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>When I began to learn this
stuff about the way reality

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:84%
actually functions, the way
it is and why we're here,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I felt it's a terrible
injustice to people

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that they don't know
about this stuff.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>More and more orbs are
showing up in photographs

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
happening because the veil

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.340 align:middle line:90%
between dimensions is lifting.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.640 align:middle line:10%
There's a change going
on, frequencies shifting,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.350 align:middle line:10%
time taking on new meaning, and
mankind understanding existence

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.860 align:middle line:10%
in a whole new light.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>>What does that really
mean, the veil is lifting?

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
frequency is changing,

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that we are moving into a
different frequency of light.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what was once a block,
and we couldn't see things,

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:17.250 align:middle line:84%
now has been diffused and we're
able to see through the dark.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>That veil is
lifting, with things

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:84%
like seeing the orbs,
probably with things

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:90%
like seeing crop circles.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but it may very
well be the same kind of idea

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:90%
that the veil is lifting.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>My wife was visiting
the crop circles,

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and she is very sensitive
and was telling me

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:84%
all the emotions and what
was happening to her.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And she concluded that
the crop circles was a way

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to reveal to us the world
that we normally don't see.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And the orbs could be a similar
part of the same pattern,

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to make us accustomed
to other dimensions.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.840 align:middle line:10%
>>I do think that there are many
changes occurring on the planet

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:10%
right now that makes it
possible for us to see orbs

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.790 align:middle line:10%
and to photograph them.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Many people from
all walks of life

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.390 align:middle line:10%
are having that experience.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I think this is a really
magnificent adventure opening

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.820 align:middle line:84%
up for all of humanity,
to be able to capture,

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.075 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, without
being a guru or a mystic

00:52:20.075 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
or fasting for 40 days,
to be able to capture,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.220 align:middle line:84%
at will, beings that are
of a different dimension

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.190 align:middle line:84%
to ours is quite a new
experience in the history

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.050 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>This is just another thing
where we're getting clues,

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:41.310 align:middle line:84%
more and more, that your and
my consciousness is not it.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We are just a part in a huge
continuum of consciousness

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and of conscious beings.

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Remember, it's science
that brought the technology

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:84%
for people around the world to
see what's always been there.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not new.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.990 align:middle line:90%
This is not new.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It's new to disbelievers.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's new to really do
realize you're never alone.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is new to realize an old
adage that everything you do

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.180 align:middle line:90%
is seen.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>The orbs are like
portals or windows

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.270 align:middle line:90%
into that other dimension.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They're giving us
a sense of what

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.280 align:middle line:84%
we can experience once we
open our belief system to it.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.160 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>With an increase
in consciousness,

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the whole system is
actually evolving.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And the whole system
is part of God.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what God is in my mind.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:50.370 align:middle line:84%
God is not just a
figure somewhere.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:55.610 align:middle line:84%
God is the entirety of
the consciousness that

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:84%
has ever been,
that will ever be.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And since we are producing,
quote unquote, consciousness,

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:08.715 align:middle line:84%
we are in fact evolving the
immensity of God himself,

00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of God itself.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.910 align:middle line:90%
We are instruments evolving God.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:24.356 align:middle line:84%
>>If there really is a
veil lifting and humanity

00:54:24.356 --> 00:54:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is entering a new chapter of
existence, what does it mean

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.955 align:middle line:90%
and what can we do?

00:54:30.955 --> 00:54:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think this is going to
open up people's understanding

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of universe
we're living in.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's vastly different
and vastly more encouraging,

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:51.360 align:middle line:84%
vastly more hopeful, vastly
more empowering for all of us

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.380 align:middle line:90%
than we ever thought before.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Orbs make you really think
about how you're never alone,

00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:00.940 align:middle line:84%
there's always these loving,
joyous beings around us

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.610 align:middle line:84%
constantly if we
rise to the occasion.

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>To me, it has made the
spiritual reality much more

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:84%
real, much more real
than ever before.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I was always aware
that that exists,

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that this spiritual
reality is an extension

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.680 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
reality that we have.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But now, we actually
have an evidence of it.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And that is a big thing.

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:30.968 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

00:55:30.968 --> 00:55:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.600 align:middle line:10%
>>People are being introduced
to unusual phenomena

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and becoming used to
that idea, accepting it,

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:45.110 align:middle line:10%
being willing to consider
it, putting the seed

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.800 align:middle line:10%
in people's minds.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.450 align:middle line:10%
>>There are many changes
going on right now.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.270 align:middle line:90%
And we can't stop the changes.

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:53.920 align:middle line:90%
We have to go with them.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's my hope that, by
educating people about orbs,

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:01.340 align:middle line:84%
they can greet the changes
with love and not fear.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>And there is a way, I
think, that we can make it

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:10.520 align:middle line:84%
if we follow these signs that
are abundantly out there.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes a
creative minority,

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.022 align:middle line:84%
and then the scale will tip
towards life abundantly.

00:56:17.022 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>The orbs are a part in this
big increase in consciousness.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>We're on an epoch change.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:30.400 align:middle line:84%
We, at this time, more than
ever, need to know who we are.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And we need, more than
ever, to depend upon science

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to understand that concept
of the many worlds theory,

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.460 align:middle line:84%
so that in one way,
when people know

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.320 align:middle line:90%
that, we change our reality.

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.690 align:middle line:84%
As the orbs making
a presence know,

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in itself, has its by-product.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And its own by-product is
is that, in a small measure,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.530 align:middle line:84%
it gives hope to people
that there are answers

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and that there is life
beyond this troubled world

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and that the dead do live and
that there is a purpose to us.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that small
measure leads to change.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not heralding
in anything.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We're just starting to
see for the first time.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's huge.

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>If we can just flip the switch
to that entirely new, different

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.930 align:middle line:84%
way of understanding
and then being,

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:33.190 align:middle line:84%
a vastly different
world is awaiting us.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>In the healing arts,
we always say the moment

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.820 align:middle line:84%
we move into higher vibrations,
everything is possible.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think these
images, to me, represent

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.630 align:middle line:84%
what those higher
vibrations really means.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It's time now for
us to make the leap

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.670 align:middle line:84%
into the new awareness,
the new consciousness.

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
it's all about, right?

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.676 align:middle line:84%
It's about expanding
our consciousness.

00:57:56.676 --> 00:57:59.531 align:middle line:90%
>>If we only made the leap.

00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's like jumping
across a crevasse.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:08.360 align:middle line:84%
You cannot jump across a
crevasse in two stages and stop

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.540 align:middle line:90%
halfway to see how you're doing.

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>We're here to make
known the unknown,

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.120 align:middle line:90%
not to relive the past.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.390 align:middle line:90%
We start to break from that.

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And human consciousness
has a huge morning.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that how we
increase our awareness,

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.480 align:middle line:84%
we increase also our
perception to this phenomenon.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So we are becoming a
new human, if you want.

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>It's just part of our
destiny and our evolution

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to experience these other
planes and dimensions

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:42.530 align:middle line:84%
as well as the true self, which
is an inter-dimensional being.

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>You can never kill
consciousness and energy.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:10%
You can never destroy a
thought, because you can never

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.200 align:middle line:10%
destroy energy.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And we have always been.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And we will always be.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>>This is a very important
aspect that we need to know,

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.670 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness will remain.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness, my
consciousness will remain.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the orbs
remind us of that.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:14.605 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that the message
of the phenomenon of orbs

00:59:14.605 --> 00:59:17.920 align:middle line:84%
is something that's opening
up that vast perspective

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to each and every
one of us today.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.820 align:middle line:90%
We're coming into a new time.

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how fast or
slow that revolution may be.

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it's going to be a
lot more rapid than we think.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>My biggest hope is that our
species can move gracefully

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:38.996 align:middle line:84%
and with love through
whatever lies ahead.

00:59:38.996 --> 00:59:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's what
we've come for.

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of
this time on the planet,

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to move through that veil, to
see what's on the other side

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side of
that and on and on and on.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>It is an evolving,
adventurous journey.

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>It's going to be
incredible, once we

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:58.110 align:middle line:84%
get through this shift and these
changes, what's on their side.

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>The veil is lifting.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.175 align:middle line:84%
>>And it will be a
huge paradigm shift.

01:00:02.175 --> 01:00:04.150 align:middle line:90%
We're already on our way there.

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>The doors are open now.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.170 align:middle line:90%
The veils are lifting.

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Get your digital
camera fully charged

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and have your mind fully open.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Come out and play in
this amazing universe.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%

yourself what's out there.
