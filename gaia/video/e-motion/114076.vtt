- The way I understand
emotions are

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:10%
that when we have
emotions, oftentimes

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:10%
we don't express our emotions.

And the good emotions,
we do express.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:10%
But the negative or the
painful emotions, they

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:10%
get trapped in our body.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And we can become sick
from those emotions.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And the way I understand it
is like a glass of water,

then, ultimately, it's

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a
non-contrast CAT scan,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see a dot
with concentric rings

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
like a bull's eye.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And what he found is that if
a person had testicular cancer

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
or ovarian cancer
that spot would

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
be at the same location in the
brain for all of the people.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And he would ask
the people, "Hey,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
what did you just experience?"

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And they would talk
about loss of children.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
His premise is that
the brain will download

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
all of our emotions first.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When we feel an
emotion strongly enough,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
what we're really feeling
is a vibrational energy.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.248 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion has its own
specific vibrational frequency.

00:09:52.248 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Anger is a different emotional
energy, a different frequency,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.123 align:middle line:84%
a different vibration
than frustration.

00:09:57.123 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's different
than sadness.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And they're all different.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling
an intense emotion,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
your whole being can
take on this vibration.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.143 align:middle line:84%
And it's during those times
that sometimes the energy

00:10:07.143 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of that emotion that you're
feeling is too powerful.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And that energy can become
trapped and stuck in the body.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And because that's all the body
really is an energy field, when

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
you distort that energy
field, you eventually

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:90%
start to have problems.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.548 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
really doing is

00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:23.138 align:middle line:84%
you're distorting the tissues
of the body themselves.

00:10:23.138 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you distort tissue
and you irritate tissue

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
long enough that tissue,
starts to have problems.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And it can go through those
changes that we call cancer.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most amazing
substances in our body is

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
connective tissue.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
There's more connective
tissue in our body

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
than any other tissue.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:90%
What's connective tissue?

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a protein.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It consists of actually
several proteins.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
One is collagen and
the other is elastin.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Collagen gives fascia strength.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
While elastin gives
it flexibility.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Literally everything
in your body

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded and
interconnected in this fabric.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So your big toe is
connected to your right ear

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
through a connective
tissue network.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The other amazing function
of connective tissue

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
conductive of energy.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we protect ourselves
from an overwhelming emotional

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
or physical experience,
our body goes

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
into a protected state which
causes muscles to contract.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
The muscles contract and then
the surrounding connective

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
tissue begins to be strained by
those contractions causing it

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to thicken and bond to
each other and harden.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The only disease that exists
in the human experience is

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
chaos at the atomic level, which
leads to chaos at the molecular

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
level, which leads to chaos
at the cellular level.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And when enough
cells are in chaos,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
you feel it as a sign
or a signal of a chaos

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:90%
or an offense in the body.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what the word
"symptom" means.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:90%
A sign or a signal of a chaos.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the accumulation of
suppressed emotion and stress

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and pain creates tensions
that begin to layer upon layer

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and accumulate over time and
begin to act upon our joints,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:90%
our blood vessels, our organs.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon of contracted
muscle and harden restricted

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
connective tissue is what's
referred to as body armor.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.405 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's the AMA says 80%
of all health issues are stress

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:31.205 align:middle line:90%
related.

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Your body is your
unconscious mind.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know the difference
between an experience

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
in your life that creates
an emotional response

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and an emotion that we
fabricate by thought alone.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it's believing
it's in the same environmental

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a scientific fact
that the chemicals of stress

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
dysregulate and down regulate
our genes that create disease.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we can turn on a stress
response just by thought alone

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and those chemicals can make us
sick, then by very definition

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts can make us sick.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So anywhere in your body
where you're not only tense

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
but where you feel hard is
evidence of places in your body

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
where you're storing emotion
or sensation from the past.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The wisdom of thousands
of years through traditional

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine, through
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They had an understanding
that we have

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
lost in Western medicine today.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
specific emotions affected

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:90%
specific parts of the body.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.747 align:middle line:84%
The kidneys carried fear
and liver carries anger.

00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about people who drink.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they over
stimulate the liver.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And they become angry.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the lungs
produce the emotion of grief

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:90%
among others.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so people who tend to have
a lot of grief in their lives

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:90%
tend to suffer from lung issues.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We all know people that
will come and tell you the same

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
story over and over
and over again.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They're really
suffering in that story.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we discover is all
the places where they secretly

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
suffer in their life, where
they feel that they're

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
obliged or obligated to
do certain things that

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:90%
impacts the knees.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Where they don't feel
supported or they

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
have a worry for money that
will support the lower back.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Where they have difficulty
in communicating

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
or they feel that the weight of
the world is on their shoulders

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that affects that
upper back and neck.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I want you to understand why
different cultures knew if you

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:10%
have a pain in your thumb,
that's very significant

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:10%
in a very significant emotion.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have a pain in
your elbow, your shoulder,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
if you feel a little pain
in your chest, in your hips,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
in your stomach, in
your intestines--

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people don't
understand anymore

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the connection of the entire
body to the brain and the brain

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
seeing pictures
that create emotions

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
which create behaviors.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They will spin in their mind
this conflict over and over

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The automatic brain is
responsible to keep us alive.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what it will
do is it will download

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
into a specific body part.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So the person can
continue to function.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
When it first happens,
it's very clear with a dot

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and concentric rings around it.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The bigger the conflict, the
bigger the concentric rings.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be a testicular
cancer or an ovarian cancer

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and that would download first
into the ovarian or testicular

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
relay in the brain
and, simultaneously,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:90%
on to the organ itself.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And as a person begins to
find solutions and repair,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
you will see that this
concentric rings and the

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
dot itself will change
in how it looks.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Emotions tend to build up,
and we tend to push them away

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:10%
as they build up because we've
been taught to resist things

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:10%
that don't feel good instead of
feel the things that don't feel

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:10%
good.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And we look for answers.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that the answers

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
aren't out in our world,
they're inside us.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the feelings
are from inside us.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:10%
>> When I look at the
mathematics I've written

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:10%
and the concepts that
these mathematics bring,

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:10%
it shows that
within every proton,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:10%
every subatomic particle in
the nuclei of atoms is all

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:10%
the energy, all the
information of all other atoms

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we go inwards
is when we actually

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
connect with that oneness
with that connectivity

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:90%
of all things.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And we call these
trapped emotions patterns,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:10%
but we do experience
them that way.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:10%
If it's an experience that we
have not completed and come

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:10%
back to self, we do
find a way to keep

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:10%
repeating those experiences.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we re-traumatize
ourselves.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
We pick partners that create
the same emotional dynamics,

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the same physiological
disabilities because our energy

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:90%
is not flowing.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most amazing
discoveries is the discovery

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that 90% of our energy is being
used to suppress energy from

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:90%
our past.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you can get access
to that suppressed energy

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and release it, all the energy
we're using to suppress,

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:90%
you get back.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Because your body is
recreating itself all the time.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:10%
Literally, this is your story.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:10%
Your biology is your biography.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we want is we want
to get all this stuff out

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
of the cells.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
We want the new cell
when it goes over

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to replicate to come
over to this guy,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.558 align:middle line:84%
to the new cell
that's being created,

00:18:08.558 --> 00:18:09.725 align:middle line:90%
and say, "I've got nothing."

00:18:09.725 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, during the last 10
years that I was in practice,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I was working with some of the
sickest people on the planet.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
People who had been told that
there was no cure for them.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.722 align:middle line:84%
People who were
suffering from things

00:18:23.722 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
like cancer or chronic fatigue
syndrome, fibromyalgia, lupus,

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and other diseases.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that the
subconscious mind absolutely

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
holds the key to understanding
the true underlying reasons why

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:90%
those people were sick.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Now our subconscious mind
from conception to puberty,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
primarily conception
to seven years of age,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
is programmed with
emotions, memories.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>> From the beginning
of your birth,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:10%
you start encoding the world
and good experiences and bad

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:10%
And the unconscious
mind holds this,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:10%
it stores it, and makes it
real to your conscious mind

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:10%
later on in life.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We're successfully producing
whatever it is we produce.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.588 align:middle line:84%
If you're depressed, you're
doing something correctly

00:19:01.588 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%
inside your mind.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have pain
inside your mind,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a resource to help
create and manifest it

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:90%
in a belief system.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We're often taught
starting at an early age--

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
you can have a
child who's crying,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're
distracting everyone.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And what do the parents do?

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They say stop, be
quiet, shut that down.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Men really have a
lot of difficulty

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't been
allowed to feel their emotions.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:90%
There's many sayings.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Big boys don't cry.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So you will have a
strong experience

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of emotion.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
But then it gets shut down.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it
gets stuck in the body.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
disease gets created,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that's how energy
drains from us, that

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:90%
is how we become disconnected.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And really Western
medicine really

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
wants to just go in and cut
things out and call it a day.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is what
created that cancer,

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that disease in the first
place is still in the cells.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever noticed that
when you have a headache,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
if you focus on the headache,
it gets worse and it amplifies.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And your emotions get involved.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And now you're in total chaos.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And you think you need
some kind of medical drug

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:90%
to kill the pain.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't cure anything.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a neurotoxin.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And it just blocks
the electric signal.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Get to the cause.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
What is the negative
source, the toxic emotion

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and/or the toxicity of something
that you're eating and drinking

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that's also affecting your
emotions in a negative way?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Detox it, clear it.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What I have found is that
90% of all the pain that we

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:84%
experience is due to trapped
emotions to emotional baggage.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is really
the elephant in the living

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
room in Western medicine that
we are missing completely.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:10%
When people are in pain
in Western medicine,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.423 align:middle line:10%
we give them drugs to
suppress that pain.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
When people have
diseases, we give

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
them medications to suppress
the symptoms of those diseases.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
When in reality,
those symptoms are

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
the body crying out telling us
there's something wrong here.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And the single biggest
imbalance that we suffer from

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:90%
is emotional baggage--

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:90%
our trapped emotions.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Those energies that stay with us
after these traumatic emotional

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:90%
events that we suffer from.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>> And so what happens in
today's world because of what

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:10%
we have set up that we
call civilized society,

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:10%
so many of the things that are
pushed upon the masses create

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:10%
negative emotional molecules.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:10%
Once they're formed,
they're real.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in the most
toxic time on the planet.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:90%
We are all flooded.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
We are flooded with
environmental toxicity,

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:84%
heavy metals or chemicals
or pesticides that

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:90%
are sprayed on our food.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Negative emotions
will be in cells,

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like they
seal the toxicity in.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can't even get them
out of the body unless you know

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
how to.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important we
understand how to remove

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
negative emotional
molecules and restore them

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
with positive
emotional molecules.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the very foundation of
health, life, and longevity.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I look at every symptom
as a conversation that

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that
happens in the body,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
there is actually nothing
that happens in our life

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:90%
by coincidence.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:90%
We are not made wrong.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%
We're not broken.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We're not missing anything.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
That every so-called problem
of the body is a portal.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone knows
someone that is in pain.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows
someone that is

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
dealing with
depression or anxiety

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.448 align:middle line:90%
or self sabotage in some way.

00:22:50.448 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Many of us know
someone who's dealing

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
with post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is these
emotional energies,

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
these invisible
energies that are

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
the underlying cause of all of
these things in my experience.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We find that people that have
extra weight, there's a reason.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily about
what the person is eating.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that might
contribute to it.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
it's the emotions

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
connected with what the person
is experiencing in their life.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So often it's a person
wanting to show up,

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to exist for people in
their life, in their world,

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and they feel small.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
this big in response

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:90%
to everything that's going on.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And so their body
responds in weight,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
in packing it on, and being
bigger in their world.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm really also of the
belief that though trapped

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
emotions are the source of
everything that causes us

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
difficulty in life and keeps
us from being in our divine

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm also a great
believer that it's not

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that difficult to begin to
move this energy once we

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
are aware that that's
what's trying to happen.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If we allow ourselves
into those feelings instead

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
of resisting them
things begin to change.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But therein lies the
rub-- how to get in?

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way and that
I found through 40 or 50

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
years of searching
is through feeling.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Our body is just waiting for
that magic moment when we begin

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to allow ourselves to come
out of that survival state.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And being able to open and be
vulnerable to feeling again

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:84%
is the first start
of healing our hearts

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and getting back to our joy.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go down through
the layers of those emotions

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
underneath at the very
bottom is your true nature,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
is your peaceful self,
your joyous, your playful,

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:90%
your connected self.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.825 align:middle line:84%
We see someone who's happy
and joyful all the time.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, what's
wrong with them?

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're really
in their natural state.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:10%
>> We need to follow the first
principle of success that

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:10%
says--

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:10%
"Think of what you want,
not what you don't want."

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, if you keep
on doing what you're doing,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to keep on
getting what you're getting.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we allow
those chemicals,

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
those emotions to last
for hours or days--

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:90%
that's called a mood.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we keep the
same emotional reaction,

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the same refractory period
lasting for weeks or months,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.157 align:middle line:90%
that's called a temperament.

00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So you would say,
why does that person

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.032 align:middle line:90%
have such an angry temperament?

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
You say, I don't know?

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Why are you so angry?

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
The person says well I had this
experience nine months ago,

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm living by the
same emotional reaction.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if we keep those same
refractory periods running

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
for years on end, that's
called a personality trait.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So then it makes sense then in
order to change our personality

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or change some
aspect of ourself,

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the
emotions that we've

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:84%
memorized that literally
are stored in the body.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So often people think that
they have forgiven people,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and they haven't.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Because their body is
expressing their unforgiveness

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
through liver issues or pain
or different things like that.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so then there's
no energy to begin

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to live life until we
can resolve our issue,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
we can resolve our problem.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We understand that the
power of the mind is proven

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:84%
scientifically that it can heal
itself over and over again.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And, oftentimes, you hear
a doctor or researcher

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
saying with lemon
in their mouth,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:84%
"Well, this placebo effect is
ruining our good research."

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect is proving
that the mind can heal itself

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the sugar pill
or the fake operation.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the nocebo effect
is exactly the opposite.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Here the nocebo
effect is they're

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:84%
getting the right drug,
the right surgery,

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and yet they don't heal.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet both of these people
are doing exactly the same thing

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
but looking in
different directions.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
They're using the universal
pattern of belief or creation.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
interesting thing.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Research has shown where
they did two groups.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:90%
One group got fake radiation.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
That's means not
even real radiation.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:90%
And 1/3 of them lost their hair.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It is the power of our
mind, the power of belief,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
our inner creations

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and produce
healing or no healing.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I found is that
by releasing these trapped

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:84%
emotional energies
that were invisible,

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I could change how people
felt. And I could change

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
people's pain level
instantaneously in many cases.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I finally realized that
we could get people well

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
who had been told that
there was no cure.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And when a medical
doctor tells you

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that there's no cure,
what he really means

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't be cured
with drugs or with surgery.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> True transformation comes
when we break free from

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
the chains of those
emotional addictions,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to go into the
operating system where those

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
programs exist, and we begin to
make transformational changes.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of true
transformation is called joy.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now that elevated
emotion is a liberation

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:90%
of energy out of the body.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And the body is
freed from the past,

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and it moves into
the present moment.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to experience
the second type of emotion.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We begin to feel joy,
goodwill, gratitude.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really true that as
we start to release emotions,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.278 align:middle line:84%
it is like peeling off
the layers of an onion.

00:28:35.278 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of those may have occurred
when they were a child.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of those may have
happened during their divorce

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or during their working years or
during college or high school.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we are
able to get to a point

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
where we no longer have
those trapped emotions, where

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:90%
the body is clear of those.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And at that point it's like
stepping out of the old skin

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that we've been carrying
all these years,

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and we step out of that
and we become this person

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that we were really intended
to be in this world.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this is about.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
is so powerful.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So many women are being told
if you haven't started to have

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
children past a certain age,
it's not going to happen.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe
that that is a belief.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you do get to a point
where things do shut down.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women actually have--
they've had miscarriages,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
they've had abortions,
they've had sexual abuse.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And this whole area,
their female organs,

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
have the emotional
debris stored in there.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And they're unable to conceive.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You clear that out, and
then you've got babies.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a client, they
had done everything.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
They'd done all the IVF.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I believe she was 44 or 45.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
We did an emotional process.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.782 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any energetic
clearing and boom-- twins.

00:29:46.782 --> 00:29:48.115 align:middle line:90%
I could show you their pictures.

00:29:48.115 --> 00:29:51.480 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The subconscious mind
acts as a lens of perception,

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
but even more, the subconscious
mind acts as a broadcasting

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:90%
signal.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and it broadcasts a
frequency of energy

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that then attracts that
same frequency and energy.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's use
for an example--

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:90%
here I am at--

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my mother's womb.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm developing in
my mother's womb.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And my dad is out of a job.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And my mom is anxious because
it's the third child that's

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:90%
coming around.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The heartbeat and the emotions
that my mom my dad are feeling

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
are directly influencing
like a computer

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
being programmed and
downloading information.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm directly downloading
this information.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And this becomes a stored file.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And that file then later in life
doesn't just sit there quiet.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Out of the
University of Utah,

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:84%
they are doing research
on epigenetics.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're discovering that
the offspring carry this trauma

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:90%
for the previous generations.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They did some scientific
studies with mice,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and they conditioned by
shocking the mice to be

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:90%
afraid of cherry blossoms.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
The second and third
generation of mice--

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
just introducing the cherry
blossom without the shock,

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
their offspring were still
afraid of the cherry blossoms.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So this proves that there
is an epigenetic link

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that the mice carried the
fears of their ancestors.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If a baby is born
feeling unloved and unwanted

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and unaccepted, then that
creates a belief system.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
They will then grow
up and go through life

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and attract to
themselves whatever

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:90%
supports that belief system.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> An energy is in motion.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:90%
And so it stays in motion.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets triggered,
that energy gets triggered,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:84%
it broadcasts a signal
that then attracts

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
people and circumstances that
give me the same experience--

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
different face, different name
but the same kind of experience

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:90%
in my life today.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.370 align:middle line:90%
This is patterns.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
The key is to
begin to understand

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that there are
emotional patterns

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that we carry in our
life that, as a result

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of these emotional patterns that
are in our subconscious mind,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
influence our
relationship with money,

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
influence our relationships
with each other,

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
influence every
aspect of who we are.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:41.792 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.792 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You see consciously,
we don't remember much.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
much consciously.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:10%
We live in our
conscious mind, but we

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:10%
don't remember what we had
for breakfast yesterday.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:10%
And we forget our wallet.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We forget our laptop.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.893 align:middle line:84%
We forget our keys,
all kinds of things.

00:32:54.893 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind, however,
is a holographic archiving

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:84%
computer that is
remembering every moment

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of your existence, every split
second of your existence.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And that computer,
that subconscious mind

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
knows exactly what's wrong
with you if you're sick.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.478 align:middle line:84%
It knows exactly what needs
to be done to get you well.

00:33:10.478 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It knows exactly what
trapped emotions you have--

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
who was involved, when
they occurred everything

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.052 align:middle line:90%
in precise and perfect detail.

00:33:17.052 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Those same emotions that
are going on outside of you are

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:10%
going on inside of you.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And your blood is pumping
these chemicals of frustration,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of jealousy, of
anxiety in our cells--

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
it's so interesting--
have these receptor

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.410 align:middle line:84%
sites, these protein
receptors that bind

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:90%
these molecules of emotion.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing
about these receptors

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is that these are the same
receptors that bind heroin.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.927 align:middle line:90%
And when you take heroin once--

00:33:47.927 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:90%
An addict.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Guess what, we are
addicted to our emotions?

00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we find ourselves
not in a happy relaxed state,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:90%
we have anxieties.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:90%
We have panic attacks.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds
of things going on.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.172 align:middle line:84%
We're just under the gun,
under the gun, under pressure.

00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We gotta get this done,
we gotta get that done.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.630 align:middle line:90%
It's time to like-- slow down.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:10%
>> So when presented with
this idea of healing where

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.330 align:middle line:10%
you're supposed to let go
of the past and really open

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:10%
to feelings that you've
suppressed and released them,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:10%
people will often say, I
don't know how to do that.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm afraid if
I do, that I might

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
be worse off than I am now.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
models of healing

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.400 align:middle line:84%
are young children, especially
like around two or three.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
such emotional courage

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:90%
and freedom and fluidity.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look at these
young children,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:90%
they laugh when they're happy.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:90%
They cry when they're sad.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:90%
They scream when they're angry.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they're frightened,
they come to their parents.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.493 align:middle line:84%
And all they want to
do is just to be held.

00:35:04.493 --> 00:35:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And when they're held, they
might curl up in a little ball

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
and maybe shake a little bit.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:10%
And when they feel
safe and comforted,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.530 align:middle line:10%
they let their feelings
out and they express them.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they run right back out
and play again and are laughing

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and are happy again.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what we all
have the capacity to do.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We can heal ourselves of all
this accumulated emotion that's

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:84%
been building up in
our bodies causing

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:84%
it to be tense and hard,
affecting us, causing us pain,

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and depriving us of all this
energy that's all locked up

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:84%
instead of being available
to us in our present day life

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to do the things that
we really want to do.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of the
biggest questions people have,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
at least, when they come to
engage with me is what is

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:90%
my purpose in life.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't get at it.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel it.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do that is
simply fill in the blank.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:10%
If I weren't afraid, I would--

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>> So whatever you
want in your body,

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:10%
you simply give thanks for it.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:10%
You don't ask for it
because if you continually

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:10%
ask for something, you are
saying you don't have it.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
If you give thanks
for it, you're

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.125 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging that
you do have it.

00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>> So where you place your
attention is where you place

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:10%
your energy.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And as we begin to decide really
clearly on creating a future

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.070 align:middle line:10%
or creating a new destiny,
the more we bring it to life.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I run into people
who are depressed,

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:10%
and they are so depressed,
and the medical drugs

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:10%
they're on, all you gotta do is
read the side effects that say

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:10%
they can lead to suicides,
murders, all kind--

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:10%
come on.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Go to your general
physician, and you'll say,

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a hard time and I'm
depressed and I'm exhausted.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And they'll give you an
antidepressant, an SSRI.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Psychotropic medication
literally just

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:84%
moves what chemicals
you have around.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
What happens if your
pharmacy is already depleted?

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you realize the ancients
knew what to do for depression?

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Number one-- get
out into the sun.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:90%
The sun is healing.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Number two-- the colors
of the plant foods

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.090 align:middle line:90%
of orange and yellow.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
If you will eat an orange
and pineapple together,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:84%
you watch what happens to
depression within 72 hours.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:84%
The emotional molecules
being generated

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:84%
in the neurochemistry of the
brain, it will blow you away.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a scientific
experiment done a little ways

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
back, where they were looking
to see if emotions filter

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:90%
our perception.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So they took a group of people
that were clinically depressed,

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and they showed them
equal slides of a wedding

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
scene and a funeral scene.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, they brought
them back into the lab.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said to them-- which
were there more slides of?

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Were there were more
slides of a wedding scene

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:90%
or a funeral scene?

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of the clinically
depressed people

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.640 align:middle line:84%
said, well, they were way more
slides of the funeral scene.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So as we begin to
remove the masks

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
or remove the lenses that
block our true greatness

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:84%
or our true self,
we begin to see

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:90%
what's already always existed.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have the
mind to perceive it.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The way that we can speak
with the subconscious mind,

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.730 align:middle line:84%
this invisible
part of ourselves--

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:90%
this unseen part of our self--

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.400 align:middle line:84%
is through what I call
a muscle reflex testing.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Every body is built on reflexes.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes blink,
your iris constricts,

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:84%
your tongue salivates,
your knee jerks.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We have reflexes that control
every aspect of our body.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And so muscle, the strength of a
muscle, the ability of a muscle

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.580 align:middle line:84%
to lockout or give
way gives us a read

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.780 align:middle line:84%
when our subconscious mind
is in a reactive state

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.782 align:middle line:90%
and when it's not.

00:39:12.782 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
When we're in an
active state, when

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:84%
the conscious and
subconscious mind are bridged

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or when they're are gapped.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how to
muscle test yourself.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You can muscle test
another person.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You can use someone
as a surrogate

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to work on an animal or
a child or a person who

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.608 align:middle line:84%
is not able to do muscle
testing themselves.

00:39:29.608 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:84%
The simple way, and I
just want to show you

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.560 align:middle line:84%
how to muscle tests so that
you can really discover

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that are buried
in your subconscious mind that

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
haven't been fully
processed in your heart

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.800 align:middle line:90%
is you just keep your arm in.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine that
you're holding a bucket

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and you like fill that bucket up
with like five pounds of gold.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hand on
top, and I push down.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I tell this arm to hold strong.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for it to lock
up, looking for to lockout.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything gets
compared to that.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And it locks out.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Now so many things can
trigger your subconscious mind

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.270 align:middle line:90%
emotionally to react.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it be
thinking about something,

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a color,
a sound something

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
can trigger a type of
condition response.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:90%
When I even say the word love--

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.060 align:middle line:84%
just the word "love--"
I get that elbow

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and I say hold
strong, it locks out.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
When I say the word
"fear--" fear, there's

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.780 align:middle line:90%
an energy to that.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I can actually even feel it.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:90%
When I just say it fear--

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.903 align:middle line:90%
hold strong, hold strong.

00:40:25.903 --> 00:40:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And it might look
like, oh, you're

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.362 align:middle line:90%
just doing that yourself.

00:40:28.362 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not-- hold strong.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to go back
to love-- love, love, love.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Hold strong-- it locks out.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most profound
proofs of this work is that it

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:84%
works with animals,
as well as people.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people might say this
is due to the placebo effect.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's no placebo
effect working with animals.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Emotion Code works
beautifully with animals.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have found that
90% of all their problems

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.600 align:middle line:84%
are also due to
trapped emotions.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we find that when
we're working with animals,

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.975 align:middle line:84%
we need to work with
the owner as well.

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
the animal will

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.782 align:middle line:84%
take on the trapped
emotions that the owner has.

00:41:05.782 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a dynamic going on
between the two of them that

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:90%
sometimes has to be addressed.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the most amazing
stories about this

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:84%
was a horse that I was
asked to work on one day.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And we work on a horse
through a surrogate person,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:84%
typically, where we'll have
one person that we will test.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And we will ask questions
directly of the animal

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and get the answers on
the surrogate person's

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.640 align:middle line:90%
outstretched arm.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm asking
questions of this horse,

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.368 align:middle line:84%
I find that the horse
has an imbalance--

00:41:31.368 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:90%
it had a problem with lameness.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.113 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't walking correctly.

00:41:34.113 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it had a couple of different
veterinarians look at it.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.197 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure
out what was wrong.

00:41:38.197 --> 00:41:39.350 align:middle line:90%
So they called me.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was it had an
imbalance in its hindquarters

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that was due to a
trapped emotion.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And the trapped
emotion was sadness.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm asking
questions, there's

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
a crowd gathered
around listening.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Is this trapped emotion
about another horse?

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it about a human?

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it about a dog?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.560 align:middle line:90%
A cat?

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.525 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:56.525 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm running out of options.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.375 align:middle line:84%
A bird flies overhead, and
I asked, is it about a bird?

00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that
came back was, yes.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It was about a bird.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And everyone started laughing.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I started laughing too,
because it seemed so comical

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:90%
but the horses owner was there.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.970 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you know what?

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I think I know
what this is about.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:84%
She said that a week before
there was a little baby

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:84%
bird in a nest of
baby birds immediately

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.790 align:middle line:90%
in front of this horse's stall.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the baby birds
fell out of the nest

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and fell down onto the ground
and struggled for its life

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and died.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:84%
This whole sad, tragic affair
was played out immediately

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
in front of this horse
who was powerless to help

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and was overwhelmed by
the emotion of sadness.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what got stuck in the
horse-- that emotional sadness.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:90%
We released it.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.028 align:middle line:90%
They took the horse out.

00:42:38.028 --> 00:42:39.945 align:middle line:84%
And it was walking
perfectly from that moment.

00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:47.335 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.335 --> 00:42:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I can do this
on someone else.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I can do it on myself.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But that enables me
never to have to guess--

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.170 align:middle line:90%
there's no reason to guess.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
In a laser-like way,
we can know when

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
you're in an emotional
state of reaction.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So that you can process
whatever emotion

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.710 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the moment.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we go
through a very short,

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.470 align:middle line:84%
simple process to identify a
trapped emotion and to bring it

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to awareness.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.425 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we have here
the Emotion Code chart.

00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to do is
we're going to find the trapped

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.298 align:middle line:90%
emotion on this chart.

00:43:17.298 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And here's how you do it.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very simple.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The first question is, do I
have a trapped emotion that can

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:90%
be released?

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer
is yes, then you

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:84%
go to the Emotion Code
chart immediately.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And you ask is this
trapped emotion

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.040 align:middle line:90%
in column A on this chart?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:10%
If it's not in column, that
means it's in column B.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.480 align:middle line:10%
Is this trapped
emotion in column B

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.410 align:middle line:10%
in one of the odd rows?

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:44.550 align:middle line:10%
And if the answer is yes, then
you ask, is it in row one?

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it in row three?

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a yes.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Strong-- is the
emotion confusion?

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.020 align:middle line:90%
is the emotion defensiveness?

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Is the emotion grief?

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.130 align:middle line:10%
Actually, that's strong.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's a trapped emotion of
grief that we've identified.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Once that emotion is
brought to the surface,

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:10%
we're actually able to release
that trapped emotional energy

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:10%
by simply swiping either
fingertips or a magnet over

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.980 align:middle line:10%
the governing meridian which
happens to run from the lip

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.770 align:middle line:10%
over the head back all the
way down to the tailbone.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we pass our
fingers or a magnet

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
over that governing
meridian, what we're doing is

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:84%
we're actually putting
energy into that meridian.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Now a meridian is
a river of energy

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.722 align:middle line:90%
that flows just under the skin.

00:44:27.722 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
The governing
meridian connected up

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.900 align:middle line:84%
with all the meridians and that
pure intention of yours passes

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:84%
into that meridian
and releases-- it

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:84%
goes into all the
other meridians,

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and it releases that energy.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The best analogy that
I can give you for this

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:90%
is if you take a credit card--

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
If I take this credit
card and I rub a magnet

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.540 align:middle line:84%
on the back of that on
that magnetic strip,

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that information that's
encoded there is gone.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.057 align:middle line:90%
And we can't use it anymore.

00:44:54.057 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
Emotion Code works.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing as just
erasing that emotional energy

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.760 align:middle line:90%
that is stored in our body.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So once you've
released that emotion,

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the next question is to
verify with the body that

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:90%
was released.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you simply ask, did I
release that trapped emotion?

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And the answer should be yes.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You see if all things
are composed of energy.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:84%
That means fear,
shame, and guilt

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:90%
are simply forms of energy.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we can
change them, we do.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:90%
So I simply use dousing.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if you want to
know what dousing is,

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.430 align:middle line:84%
it's simply the movement
of a physical object that,

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.390 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, tells you what
you already intuitively know,

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.030 align:middle line:84%
you just don't
believe you know it.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, why don't
you check to see

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.350 align:middle line:84%
what is the effect of
unworthiness, doubt, fear,

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:90%
shame, and guilt upon you.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Transform all that,
usually, into enlightenment,

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.100 align:middle line:90%
check it again.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's not there anymore.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is we can
take one energy of any type

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and transform it
into another energy.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Where people bring touch to
your physical body and begin

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to put their hands in the places
in your body where you are

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:84%
holding on to past memory, when
they touch you in a loving,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
gentle, sensitive way, and bring
your awareness to these places

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and starts to invite us to
get conscious of these places,

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.170 align:middle line:84%
because most of us don't realize
how much stress we're really

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:84%
holding onto until somebody
actually touches it.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And once you're connected
and conscious, waiting there

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:84%
inside our bodies are those
feelings from our past

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.850 align:middle line:90%
that overwhelmed us.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow yourself
into those feelings,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the mind becomes quiet.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:58.810 align:middle line:84%
The feelings unwind as you
let yourself into them.

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow yourself to
feel these energies, emotions,

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.850 align:middle line:84%
pains, sensations, they'll
start to flow through you.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And as that begins
to happen, you

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:84%
begin to have what's
called a release.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
this release is calm.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:84%
There's real true peace as
if a load's been lifted.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Your body, your
physical body begins

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.450 align:middle line:90%
to relax on a deep level.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.470 align:middle line:90%
You begin to breathe easier.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.960 align:middle line:84%
There's energy flowing
through your body again.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting because
today's physicists have

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.900 align:middle line:84%
confirmed the teachings
of the ancient scholars.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
That everything
is made of light.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything is light.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
detox emotions is

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
when you start to feel

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
a negative emotion, number
one, slow down, take a breath,

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
get outside, maybe
even go for a walk.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't realize that
if you're emotionally upset

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't
know who you are--

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:90%
shut up and go for a walk.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You go out and you
start walking when

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:84%
you're emotionally upset
and negative and everything

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:84%
else that's going on within
three minutes, that walking,

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that motion of being outside
in the open air in the sunlight

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.750 align:middle line:90%
re-establishes and clears it.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The liver produces what
is called today anions.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Most people know it as bile.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.295 align:middle line:84%
The one food that
has anions, and it's

00:48:29.295 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:84%
the only food on the face
of the Earth they've ever

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.140 align:middle line:84%
been able to study that
produces it is lemons.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we find that
these people are

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:44.680 align:middle line:84%
lacking in typically a lot of
emotional joy and happiness

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and the positive emotions,
which weakens actually

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.870 align:middle line:90%
the function of the liver.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And the liver is tied
directly to the skin.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so if you'll get your
body out into the sunshine

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and let the yellow light of
the sun shine all on your body,

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:84%
they know it produces
emotional molecules that

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:90%
target the liver.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, they call it vitamin
D, but that's only one

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of over 1,000 nutritional
components of biophotons

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.350 align:middle line:90%
of sunlight.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:17.740 align:middle line:84%
They've only named one, and
they know there's thousands.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So here's the deal,
you drink one cup

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of fresh squeezed lemon
juice every day for 90 days.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And because the liver goes into
mitosis or cellular division

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and replaces itself
every 90 days,

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.210 align:middle line:84%
if you're being toxic
emotionally and even

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:84%
in your diet, the new
liver is weaker in function

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.150 align:middle line:90%
and can eventually fail.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:10%
If all of a sudden, you're
getting into the sunlight,

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.240 align:middle line:10%
you're drinking lemon juice,
which has the anions of bile,

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:10%
so the liver doesn't
have to produce it.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.800 align:middle line:10%
It's not stressed.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Within 90 days, we've had
people with failed livers

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:84%
have 100% functional
liver within 90 days.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.650 align:middle line:10%
>> The main thing that--

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.080 align:middle line:10%
epidemic even mainstream
medical doctors

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.740 align:middle line:10%
are checking people for
vitamin D deficiency.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught to
stay out of the sun.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And so now we don't have enough
vitamin D. And vitamin D is

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:90%
very important for your mood.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
for your health.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to actually fix
the storage unit, the only way

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to make new neurotransmitters
is through a better diet

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.850 align:middle line:84%
or amino acid therapy and
vitamins and minerals.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In Western medicine, they
have what they call these seven

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.910 align:middle line:90%
levels of neuroendocrine glands.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.810 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of other cultures, they
know it is the seven chakras--

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:90%
the exact same levels.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Those chakras, those seven areas
of the neuroendocrine systems

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of the body, running from
the pineal in the brain

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:49.990 align:middle line:84%
right on down through the body
to the reproductive organs

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:53.530 align:middle line:84%
of the ovaries and testicles
and everything in between,

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.110 align:middle line:84%
they had assigned
anciently the colors

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow moving up.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting
because it's

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
the colors of the foods
that target specifically

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:84%
those levels of the
chakras of the system.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions of
positiveness or the emotions

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.410 align:middle line:90%
of negative in those levels.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Red was a color
that the ancients

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:22.300 align:middle line:10%
knew represented power
and love and warmth.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.680 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
red and look away,

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.350 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
going to see green.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.390 align:middle line:84%
That color green--
eating those foods--

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.150 align:middle line:84%
gets rid of the negative
emotions of the color red,

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.590 align:middle line:90%
which is anger.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're seeing red.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if you're angry, if you're
irritated, if your buttons are

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:84%
pushed too easy, you need
to eat more green foods

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.310 align:middle line:90%
to clear the negative emotions.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.850 align:middle line:84%
The fastest way to heal
the emotions, according

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient wisdom,
was to able to stop eating

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.470 align:middle line:90%
because foods create moods--

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.020 align:middle line:90%
fast, faster, and faster.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.050 align:middle line:84%
"To fast" doesn't mean
to starve to death.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:07.280 align:middle line:10%
It means to strengthen, to
hold fast, to hold firm.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And the ancients knew that.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.420 align:middle line:84%
There is not one animal
on the face of this Earth

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.160 align:middle line:84%
if it's sick or injured
in any way will eat.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Even cats and dogs, they'll eat
grass to make themselves puke

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and throw up to get
rid of everything.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
never eat again

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:84%
until they know their body has
hit a point of strengthening,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:90%
of holding firm.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But what if you were to fast
just on water because water

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.550 align:middle line:84%
has all seven spectral
colors of the rainbow.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can see
a rainbow in the sky

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.830 align:middle line:84%
when it rains and light
shines through it.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.320 align:middle line:90%
A faster-- not as fastest--

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.740 align:middle line:84%
but a faster way is
to drink the blood

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.095 align:middle line:90%
or the juices of colored foods.

00:52:51.095 --> 00:52:53.870 align:middle line:90%


00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.010 align:middle line:10%
When you eat dark chocolate,
that cocoa or cocoa bean,

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:10%
the real one not the fake stuff
that's in so many products,

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:10%
but real dark chocolate or hops
in unfiltered organic beer--

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.320 align:middle line:10%
they are all of the same genius.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.630 align:middle line:90%
They're all of the same family.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those things is
to create happiness and joy

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.740 align:middle line:90%
within the human experience.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I've even helped people
addicted to different drugs

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and cigarette smoking,
commercials cigarettes, which

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:30.770 align:middle line:84%
are toxic, and you can
use something as simple

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:34.677 align:middle line:84%
as good black licorice
and macadamia nuts.

00:53:34.677 --> 00:53:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You have them together, you
carry them with you whenever

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:40.130 align:middle line:84%
you feel like having a cigarette
or has some other addiction,

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:42.230 align:middle line:90%
you eat that first.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.690 align:middle line:84%
You would not believe
the hundreds and hundreds

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.690 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds of people
that have overcome

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:51.390 align:middle line:84%
their chemical and emotional
addictions to things.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And these are the things
we've got to get back to.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
What foods and
drinks can we have

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to target any stress
or emotions that can be

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.950 align:middle line:90%
negative in the human system?

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.128 align:middle line:84%
I love this ancient
wisdom because it works.

00:54:08.128 --> 00:54:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of times, if you
are whole and healed and you are

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:15.200 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at a high frequency
without these negative things,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:20.210 align:middle line:84%
you can have toxicity come
around or you can have disease

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:90%
come near--

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're constantly being
exposed to the retrovirus,

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:90%
which is the cold virus.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
if your cells are

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.530 align:middle line:84%
full of happy emotions,
there's no place

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.260 align:middle line:84%
actually for that virus
or for that toxicity

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.640 align:middle line:90%
to get into the cell.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>> We have several techniques
that we use for letting go

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.330 align:middle line:10%
of the emotions that we are
carrying and one of them,

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:10%
which is my favorite
is the Ho'oponopono.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.560 align:middle line:84%
The Ho'oponopono comes
from indigenous Hawaii,

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and it literally
means "to make right."

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.350 align:middle line:90%
It is for simple phrases--

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:03.230 align:middle line:84%
"I'm sorry," "Please, forgive
me," "I love you," "Thank you."

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if a
person has a breakup,

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're experiencing
a lot of pain.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're not even sure
why that breakup happened.

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a great place
to use the Ho'oponopono.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So an individual would look
inside and just really access

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:90%
that pain that they're feeling.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
say, "I'm sorry.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry for whatever
reason this is showing up.

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Please, forgive me.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.040 align:middle line:90%
I love you, thank you."

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's literally taking
100% responsibility

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.410 align:middle line:84%
for whatever shows
up in our life.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You have a big
emotional release.

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you might cry.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you just feel a
tremendous amount of peace.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you let it go.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I know this sounds so simple--

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:54.350 align:middle line:90%
too simple.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.380 align:middle line:84%
This is frequently
what I hear in the work

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that I do that these
tools are simple.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it, you will see
a huge transformation begin

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.970 align:middle line:90%
to take place in your life.

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What's so important to
recognize is life is not about

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:13.100 align:middle line:90%
what happens to you.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Life is all about how
you choose to respond.

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Many things that I believe
affects people is unworthiness,

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:26.900 align:middle line:84%
doubt, fear, shame, and guilt.
Because these emotions have

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.450 align:middle line:84%
affected the human
race for centuries.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:33.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The biggest cloud to
our perception is fear.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:10%
And we're so accustomed to it.

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.310 align:middle line:10%
And we're so inside
the matrix of it,

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:40.910 align:middle line:10%
we consider it a normal
part of our reality.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And one that we just
at best can manage,

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe play dodgeball
with or hide and seek.

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I do is I
actually help people

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.620 align:middle line:84%
move through that wall of fear
by simply taking a breath,

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.190 align:middle line:84%
asking them to put their
hand on their heart,

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and focus their
attention to where

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.980 align:middle line:84%
they are in present
time looking at what's

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:90%
right in front of them.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.447 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, "What
are you afraid of?"

00:57:08.447 --> 00:57:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And then you do it again--

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:14.400 align:middle line:84%
"If I weren't afraid, I would--"
and let your heart speak.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And within two minutes, three
minutes, they've actually--

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.620 align:middle line:90%
they've emptied that fear.

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They have looked at
it, vocalized it.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But coming back to the
moment, they see that--

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I anchor them back
in present time.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not fear that
actually keeps us trapped.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It's hiding fear that
keeps us trapped.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we're able to be in
our body in a peaceful way.

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We're able to rest
in our feelings

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and not be so much in our heads.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And the neat thing
about this process

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is that as we begin to get
vulnerable again to feeling,

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we also begin to experience this
fearless part of our nature.

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:03.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of us
that is truly unafraid.

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be reminded
of that part of us.

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> As you begin to step
towards your path and purpose

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect and realign
with that kind of spiritual

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.840 align:middle line:84%
integrity, the universe
is stepping toward you.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
convergence going on

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:26.790 align:middle line:84%
until eventually you're
being met by opportunities.

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's say you're having
trouble paying your bills

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:33.043 align:middle line:10%
and you go into the feelings
around paying those bills.

00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
there's money to pay the bills.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from places
you couldn't imagine

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:41.820 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they just find
an error in your bill.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's
just really amazing

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.380 align:middle line:84%
how life and the illusion
changes because of that.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I worked on a 33-year-old
woman once who had never been

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.397 align:middle line:90%
in a long term relationship.

00:58:55.397 --> 00:58:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And she was an attractive woman.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her, "Why?

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.910 align:middle line:84%
What happened to you that
makes you feel this way?"

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.510 align:middle line:84%
She said eight years before
she was very deeply involved

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.730 align:middle line:84%
with a man that she was
very much in love with,

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and he dumped her
and broke her heart.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you might imagine
that created a wall

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:13.620 align:middle line:84%
of trapped emotional
negative energies

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.600 align:middle line:90%
around her heart-- a heart wall.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.670 align:middle line:90%
We cleared those emotions.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And when that very last
emotion was released,

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I felt the energy
coming out of her heart.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It was as if a stone
had been rolled away.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was suddenly
instantly bathed

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:33.370 align:middle line:84%
in the most beautiful amazing
energy coming out of her core.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I said now that
heart of yours is unlocked.

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said that pure essence
of who you really are

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.850 align:middle line:84%
is now radiating out
from you, and it's

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:43.890 align:middle line:90%
filling the immensity of space.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I said you're much
more likely now

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to achieve
your dream and your goal

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of falling in love and
finding your soulmate

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.070 align:middle line:90%
within this next year.

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is not unusual.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.970 align:middle line:10%
When the heart
wall is taken down

00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:middle line:10%
and those trapped
emotions are released,

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.950 align:middle line:10%
the phone sometimes starts
to ring for women who

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:10%
have been hoping it would ring.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It suddenly does.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.260 align:middle line:84%
That energy goes
out from your body.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it does
fill the immensity of space

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:11.437 align:middle line:84%
and other people tune
into that and then

01:00:11.437 --> 01:00:12.520 align:middle line:90%
they're attracted to that.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:19.020 align:middle line:90%


01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.510 align:middle line:90%
- Hey, how are you?

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:21.840 align:middle line:90%
- Good, how are you?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.860 align:middle line:84%
- I'm very good,
thank you, yeah.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.230 align:middle line:90%
So you work here?

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, level 11.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:36.900 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
- This is a little
bit bold, but do

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
you reckon we can hang
out sometime to have

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.884 align:middle line:90%
coffee or juice or something?

01:00:47.884 --> 01:00:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> OK should I got
your phone number or--

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, why not?

01:00:56.974 --> 01:00:57.774 align:middle line:90%
>> 415.

01:00:57.774 --> 01:00:59.858 align:middle line:90%
>> 415.

01:00:59.858 --> 01:01:03.628 align:middle line:90%
>> 503-5933

01:01:03.628 --> 01:01:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> 5933.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Lauren, by the way.

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Lauren, I'm Ty.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

01:01:12.272 --> 01:01:16.003 align:middle line:90%
Um, this is me.

01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thanks a lot.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.753 align:middle line:90%
It was nice to meet.

01:01:17.753 --> 01:01:19.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you too.

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:20.594 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:36.737 align:middle line:90%


01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I want you to
think about something.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
She's never been able to have
a long term relationship, why?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Because she had a heart wall.

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And when she would
see an attractive guy,

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
her heart would send a
little butterfly of love

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
towards that guy but that
little butterfly of love,

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.715 align:middle line:84%
that little love
energy from her heart

01:01:52.715 --> 01:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
would have to pass through those
layers of anger and resentment

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and depression and frustration
and sorrow and sadness.

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And by the time it got out on
the other side of that energy,

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.772 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't a little
butterfly anymore.

01:02:01.772 --> 01:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It was probably more
like a gargoyle.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And the guy on the other
end would sense that

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and go the other direction.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how this is working.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So another technique that
we use is called, oddly enough,

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.102 align:middle line:90%
the Walker from Reno.

01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking about
some kind of conflict

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
somebody else.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And, basically, what
you do is you just

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
put your hands over
your heart, and you

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
would say, "My heart is full
of love and understanding.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
My heart is full of
love and understanding."

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if I'm angry
or upset with my husband,

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it for myself.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
"My heart is full of
love and understanding--"

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes 10 or
20 times, whatever

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
allows you to come
to a place of peace.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll do
it for my husband.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
John's heart is full
of understanding

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
or Greg's heart is full
of love and understanding.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Whoever your partner is--
you'll want to personalize it.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it allows us to
change the perspective,

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to have an understanding
that most of the time people

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
are not trying to hurt us,
but rather they just missed

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:04.460 align:middle line:90%
the boat or we missed the boat.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the way
that we can clear that.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiences that we've
had in observing people going

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
within and beginning to
unmemorize an old emotion

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and then recondition the body to
a new mind or to a new emotion.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The body begins to
get back online.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It begins to heal itself.

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen people with
MS and lupus and cancer.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.940 align:middle line:10%
And we've seen their
bodies literally

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.190 align:middle line:10%
change and the conditions
return back to normal.

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So 5% of who we are
is our conscious mind.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
95% are those subconscious
programs that we've memorized.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I am so thrilled to
be 586 years old--

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.140 align:middle line:90%
actually, what am I?

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.230 align:middle line:90%
39, something like that.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I am pain free.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I've never been to a doctor.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't take
medicines, never have.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
All I do is embrace
the physics of nature.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think about
being happy and joyful.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What you find is you stop
striving, and you start living,

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
you start being rather
than working hard at it.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs, the
house you want just appears.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The money you need
seems to work out.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not logical, but
the trouble is you see,

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:33.920 align:middle line:90%
it's not logical.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no one way
that works for everybody.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:39.952 align:middle line:84%
If there was, we'd all
be doing it already.

01:04:39.952 --> 01:04:42.410 align:middle line:10%
And I will say this, if you
have something inside your mind

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:45.320 align:middle line:10%
that's hurtful and painful,
how long should you hold it?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And I say as long as you'd
like a little child hold it.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It will help you deal
with life better.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll live longer, be happier,
your wrinkles won't be as deep.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be a whole
lot happier regardless.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.297 align:middle line:84%
You'll look younger if
you know how to get rid

01:04:57.297 --> 01:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
of your stress and emotions.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.300 align:middle line:90%
You'll be thinner.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.380 align:middle line:90%
You'll make more money.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything will change when
you change your inner world

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and change what you don't
want and turn in what you do.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It works with everybody.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And we move from the
selfish states that are driven

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
by the hormones of stress
to the selfless states,

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
where we really want to
contribute or we really want

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And so making an effort to
really transform ourselves

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I think is the best way to
begin to transform the world.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter where you are,
no matter what you're going

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
through right now, no matter
what you've already gone

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
through, this is
your starting point.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And encourage you to begin to
look at yourself in an entirely

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
new way.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:51.360 align:middle line:10%
>> What I've discovered is that
98% of the world's people are

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.770 align:middle line:10%
spending 98% of their time
on things that don't matter.

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
That is, the average
person has no idea

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing
here, who they

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
are, the real fundamental
and sacred purpose

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.440 align:middle line:90%
of their whole life.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As you open to it, you're
removing the blocks that are

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in your way to abundance or
really to anything you truly

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%
desire.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you arrive where
you've been looking for.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.920 align:middle line:10%
Of course, your life will
change along that path.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And you may change
what you want.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And that, too, is OK because
that's what makes it fun--

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.760 align:middle line:90%
the option to change.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But do something that makes
someone else or something feel

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.260 align:middle line:90%
better.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
That in turn will
make you feel better.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I have a saying that
goes something like this.

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
That no act of kindness,
regardless of how small,

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:41.115 align:middle line:90%
is ever wasted.

01:06:41.115 --> 01:06:42.740 align:middle line:10%
>> You tried changing
the other people,

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.420 align:middle line:10%
you tried to change
your husband, your wife,

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.220 align:middle line:10%
your mother.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.110 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't work.

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.590 align:middle line:10%
But when you change
you, it affects them.

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because of your attitude
and your beliefs

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and your behaviors.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.835 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got to get back to
the understanding of the power

01:06:55.835 --> 01:06:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the human body
to heal itself.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to support it
with foods and air and water

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and sunshine and
walking and loving

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
relationships and finding
something that you're

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.730 align:middle line:90%
passionate about and happy.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
principles of health.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
That's where this comes from.

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Only your body can heal itself.

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Only your body heals
itself, and most people

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:25.930 align:middle line:90%
have forgotten that.

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Doctors can set bones,
but they can't heal them.

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Only your body heals itself.

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Self-care is the future, why?

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the brilliant
wisdom of the past.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
I've experienced over the last

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:47.930 align:middle line:84%
several years is that
whether I'm speaking to a CEO

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
of a company or a prison inmate
or a teacher or a janitor,

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that everybody secretly
believes in their greatness

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that they really believe
that they can do a better job

01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:59.690 align:middle line:90%
in life.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And the new science of
neuroplasticity and epigenetics

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
gives people permission to begin
to create the life that they

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
desire in that
science really has

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
become the contemporary
language of mysticism.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Science is the language
to explain possibility.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.359 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
greatest things that I've

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
learned over the
years is that you

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
don't have to be a priest
or a nun or an intellect

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.084 align:middle line:84%
to begin to apply
these principles.

01:08:33.084 --> 01:09:43.658 align:middle line:90%


01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me tell you
a little anecdote.

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
A few days ago, a lady
said to me in Los Angeles,

01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
"My husband died a year ago.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with me a
great lesson on his deathbed.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, 'Come close,
I want to tell you something.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Listen very carefully, I
can only say this once.

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't have much
strength left."

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I'm listening,
darling, what is it?"

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Remember this always--

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
each morning the moment you
take your head off the pillow,

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.690 align:middle line:90%
you have all you need."

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:19.585 align:middle line:90%


01:10:19.585 --> 01:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
That allows me to
live the kind of life

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:22.560 align:middle line:90%
that I've chosen to live.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I only wish I had
learned these things

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:27.420 align:middle line:90%
when I was much younger--

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
so old so soon,
so smart so late.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
