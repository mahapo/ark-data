of this painting, the
artist Paul Gauguin

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
has written in French
these three questions.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

Where are we going?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Like many other
people, I have puzzled

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
over the nature of human
existence for a long time,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and my work as a
documentary filmmaker

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
has given me opportunities to
consider these great mysteries

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
from many different angles.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've found
increasingly that some

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
of the most helpful and
challenging contributions

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to my quest have
come from the work

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Austrian philosopher and
educationalist Rudolf Steiner.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
This film is about Steiner's
life, and about the work

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that his ideas and
insights have inspired

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:90%
in all areas of human life--

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
ideas that challenge us to
ponder on the true nature

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:90%
In Gauguin's words, what are we?

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.235 align:middle line:84%
Steiner would probably add,
and what might we become?

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:29.803 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Rudolf Steiner challenges
us to be more conscious.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:10%
More conscious
and also, I think,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:10%
to ground our consciousness
in the wants of heart.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I feel one of the most
important things about Steiner

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is actually that
he encourages us

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
to bring thinking
and feeling together,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:90%
so head and heart together.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, meeting the work of
Rudolf Steiner was like finding

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:90%
water in the desert.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I had
searched and searched

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
through many different spiritual
paths, very much in the East,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and also in the West,
including the spiritual path

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
of modern science.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:10%
I can't think of anybody
else who simultaneously

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:10%
follows the whole philosophical
and scientific tradition

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:10%
within the West and within
modernity, studies it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:10%
carefully, becomes
very competent

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:10%
in its different disciplines,
and at the same time is clearly

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:10%
a mystic.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the challenge for me
is to individualize what he has

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%
given.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:10%
As he was in Norway, he almost
always in his talks said,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:10%
don't believe what I'm saying.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:90%
You have to try it in life.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Try it in life.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's
my inner direction.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I have to try it out,
and not just take it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
for granted it is like this.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.735 align:middle line:84%
And then life
becomes so exciting.

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think really
Steiner is about love.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:10%
But it's hard to get
to that realization,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.704 align:middle line:10%
because of so many thoughts.

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:10%
There are so many thoughts.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:10%
But when I think of
him, I don't always

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:10%
think of the thoughts,
though I'm impressed by them,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I think much more of
this man traveling

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
on drafty trains in
the middle of the night

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
to go to the next city to meet
with nine people who are trying

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
to figure something out.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Or people just claw--

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
scratching at him
constantly for help.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:90%
So he was a servant.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a privileged person.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:90%
He was a servant.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
about love really.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Steiner's influence,
particularly through his

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
indications about education,
agriculture and medicine,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:90%
is increasingly apparent.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:10%
There are seven Rudolf
Steiner Waldorf Schools

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:10%
in India, and over 1,000
worldwide, plus communities

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:10%
for those with
learning difficulties,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:10%
as well as hundreds
of farmers working

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:10%
with his suggestions of how
to not only produce healthier

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:10%
food, but also how to heal
the Earth in the process.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Waldorf Schools,
biodynamic agriculture,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Weleda, Demeter,
Hauschka, Camphill--

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.615 align:middle line:84%
these names are increasingly
familiar all over the world.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In South India, I visited
a group of small scale farmers

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
learning about the influence
not just of the sun and the moon

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
on plant growth and health,
but also of the planets,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
a reminder of what in many
parts of the world is still not

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.836 align:middle line:90%
totally forgotten.

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Steiner
shared this knowledge,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:84%
in part based on
traditional wisdom,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
in a course of lectures to
farmers in Central Europe

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.365 align:middle line:90%
in 1924, a year before he died.

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:10%
>> An awareness of the
influence of the planetary

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:10%
constellations, and
including when you sow what,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:10%
is also central to
biodynamic agriculture,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:10%
a worldwide movement informed
and inspired by that course

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:10%
of lectures delivered at a time
when the farmers were already

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:10%
expressing concern about
the effect that chemical

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:10%
fertilizers were having on
the soil and on the health

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.715 align:middle line:10%
and quality of their produce.

00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The beauty of Dr. Rudolf
Steiner is that he was not just

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
a philosopher living
in a world of ideas,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and just philosophizing
and just thinking.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:10%
He brought all these ideas
to practical human activity,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:10%
whether it's agriculture,
education, medicine,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.379 align:middle line:10%
architecture.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Steiner himself
grew up beside railway lines.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
His father was a station master,
and the exciting new world

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:90%
of trains was ever-present.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Steiner was two years old
when, in 1863, his father

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
was transferred to this station
at Pottschach in lower Austria.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
He lived here
until he was eight.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Steiner wrote in
his autobiography

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of his deep appreciation
for the unspoiled landscape

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:90%
in which he grew up.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Despite the new technology
on his doorstep,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
life for the young boy
was essentially simple--

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.405 align:middle line:90%
simple, but far from cozy.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:31.632 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
Here, Steiner lived not
only in the two worlds

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
of trains and nature,
both of which he loved,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
but also in an inner world
of spiritual experiences

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that were as real to him as
the physical world around him.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Already around the
age of seven, he

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
had a vivid experience
of a relative

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
who had just committed suicide
and who asked him for help.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was to be almost 40 years
before he could speak openly

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
about such matters.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
What is the true
nature of reality?

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
These are questions that
were to occupy Rudolf Steiner

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his life.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:10%
In 1868, the family
moved nearer to Vienna

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:10%
to the village of Neudorf.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
By now, Steiner had a
younger brother and sister.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Though less remote
than Pottschach,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
his home was still, in Steiner's
words, austere but healthy.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:10%
He served as an altar boy at the
local Catholic church, helped

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:10%
grow vegetables for the family.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:10%
But the essence of his journey
through childhood and youth--

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:10%
that long walk to school--

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:10%
was the story of a very
bright but essentially lonely

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:10%
child, nudged by his father to
study science and technology

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:10%
to qualify as an
engineer on the railways,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:10%
who was nevertheless thinking
deeply about what he called

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:10%
the enigmas of existence.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And already, at the age of 14,
studying the German philosopher

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:10%
Immanuel Kant.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
In 1879, at the age of
18, he passed his school

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
leaving examination
with distinction.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
For three years, he'd
given private tuition

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to fellow pupils
in order, he wrote,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
to contribute at
least a little of what

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
my parents had to pay out
of their meager income

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:90%
for my schooling.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And having attended a technical
rather than a grammar school,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
he had had to teach
himself Latin and Greek.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:84%
From the Austrian countryside
in which Steiner had grown up

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
as the son of a humble railway
official, the move to Vienna

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:90%
was a huge step.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Capital of the vast
Habsburg Empire,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:84%
it was a cosmopolitan city
buzzing with life, creativity,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and philosophical debate,
a cultural flowering

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
on a massive scale.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
In the autumn of that
same year, Steiner

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
enrolled at the
Technical University

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to study biology, chemistry,
physics, and mathematics.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But already his interests were
as much in German philosophy

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:90%
and literature as in science.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, his social
life began to flourish.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
The famous Cafe Griensteidl,
which for a time

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
he gave as his
address, is now more

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.425 align:middle line:84%
a tourist attraction than a
hive of philosophical debate.

00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:10%
But round the corner at
this nearby coffee house,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:10%
it is easier to imagine
the atmosphere of that era,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:10%
and the extraordinary
variety of people

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:10%
with whom the young
Steiner was mixing--

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:10%
poets, rich merchants,
Cistercian monks, feminists,

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:10%
university professors, and
poor students like himself.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:10%
I asked two young
customers, both of whom

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:10%
knew something about
Steiner's life and legacy,

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:10%
whether the sort of discussions
that Steiner and others had

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:10%
in coffeehouses like this
one were a thing of the past.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Those dialogues, really
to sit hours and hours,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and to develop an idea, I think
you can't find that in that way

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think that's sad?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In a way, yes, because
I'm old fashioned.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm quite open to
new ways of dialogues.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think especially the
communication through the net

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
is an enormous,
enormous chance, yeah?

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Opportunity.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're optimistic about the
future in that sense, are you?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very optimistic, yeah.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that idea,
it's always a question,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
how would Steiner
act in those days?

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Would he use the
internet or not?

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I think he would.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, definitely.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> He would e very, very open
to our ways and our chances

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and our opportunities to
communicate, to develop,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to work together.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Not everyone interested in
Steiner's work would agree with

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Pippa about Steiner and the
internet, not only because he,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:84%
like many others, recognized
that technological advances

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
ever since the printing
press were no replacement

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
for face-to-face
human encounters,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
but also that the mindset
behind such devices could,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
if we remain unconscious, takes
us on a slippery slope in which

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:84%
our entire world gradually
becomes dehumanized.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
What Steiner made
clear, however,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
is that all such
decisions have finally

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:90%
to rest with the individual.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> His main message,
especially to me,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
was or is that he wants us to
stand up for our own ideas.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's, especially in
our time, not that easy.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So for people, it's much more
easy to put him into a box

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
than to focus his message
and follow the message.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think he didn't
want us to follow him,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
he wanted us to
follow ourselves.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Although Steiner had an
increasingly wide circle

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
of friends, he was at the same
time following his own inner

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:90%
voice.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But, like all of us, he
needed his awakeners--

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
people who actually
change your life.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
On his regular train journey
from home into Vienna,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
he met such a person,
a man with whom

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
he could at last share his inner
life of spiritual experiences.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Felix Koguski was a herbalist
who traveled into Vienna

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to sell to apothecaries the
medicinal herbs he had gathered

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
in the countryside.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
On his back, wrote Steiner
in his autobiography,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
were his bundles of herbs.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But in his heart
was the knowledge

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
aspects of nature

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that had come to him
through gathering them.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Through Felix, Steiner
learned that there

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
existed a vast store
of traditional wisdom

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that was soon to disappear
completely from the folk

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:90%
culture of central Europe.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
In his company,
Steiner felt in touch

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
with what he called a soul
from ancient times, someone

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
with the intuitive knowledge
that he himself had experienced

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
since childhood, and
which he was already

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand,
and above all to anchor,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
in the world of modern
day consciousness.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
ingredient that Steiner

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:90%
was to increasingly emphasize.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
For every step that we take
in our search for this deeper

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
wisdom, we need to take three
steps in our moral development.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
A person should not
be on this journey,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
he wrote some 25 years
later, to accumulate

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
learning as one's own
treasure of knowledge,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
but in order to
place this learning

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:90%
in the service of the world.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the young
Steiner was to experience

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:90%
another great awakener--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
a man who was also to
profoundly influence

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:90%
the course of his life.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Among the great personalities
of the German-speaking world,

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
both past and present, he
became inspired by the work

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
of the literary giant Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe, who

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:90%
had died some 50 years earlier.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:10%
Not Goethe just as a poet
and novelist, but Goethe

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:10%
as scientist, particularly
his work in anatomy,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:10%
optics, and botany.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
Later, Steiner was to call him
the Copernicus and the Kepler

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
of the organic world.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Goethe was a huge
influence on Steiner.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:10%
And Steiner felt that he
discovered a kindred spirit

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:10%
in Goethe, because he was
approaching the natural world

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:10%
with an open heart,
and not as an object

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:10%
to be studied and
measured and quantified,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:10%
but rather as a
world that was still

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:10%
imbued with something sacred.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I think Goethe was very aware
of the sacredness of nature,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's why he wanted to
approach it in a different way,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
with empathy rather than with
objectifying consciousness.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But he still thought
of himself as a scientist,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.602 align:middle line:90%
didn't he--

00:18:15.602 --> 00:18:16.446 align:middle line:90%
Goethe?

00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> He certainly did, because
he was interested in knowledge,

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and a type of knowledge
that was a direct knowing,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
really a perceiving, to actually
see into the spiritual workings

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So he was focused much more
on the world of qualities

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
than of quantities,
and much more

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
on what could be
perceived by each person

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
as a human being unaided by
any scientific instruments.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So for him,
scientific instruments

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
tended to get in the
way of really seeing

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
what was living in nature.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's so much at odds
with the approach of mainstream

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Jeremy Naydler is a writer
with a doctorate in theology

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and religious studies who
makes his living as a gardener

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
in Oxford.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
For Goethe, the human being
is the most exact instrument.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
If you can develop
that instrument

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
into an organ of deep
perception, then of course

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
you'll see more
and more in nature.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Steiner was able to do.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
He developed himself as
a spiritual instrument,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was perceiving much
more than most people are

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
able to perceive in
the natural world.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And he extended that to
invisible worlds, of course.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.678 align:middle line:10%
>> And was pointing to the fact
that we all have this potential

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:02.478 align:middle line:10%
then.

00:20:02.478 --> 00:20:03.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:07.258 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.258 --> 00:20:09.736 align:middle line:84%
It's not so easy to
develop it, though.

00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But one just has to keep working
at it, really on a daily basis.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.515 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your understanding
of the key to working with it

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I go
into the gardens,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that the
first thing I want to do is,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I see weeds, and I see all
sorts of things that need doing.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get engaged
with practical stuff.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But I try to stop
myself, and just

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
spend at least a few
minutes with a plant,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and just observe
it, just be with it.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
immensely centering

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and healing in doing that.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it actually helps the
rest of my day in the garden.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You realize that there's
a miracle there really.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's so easy to not see it.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But that would be true
perhaps in life all together.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We just simply don't
notice things, do we?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
We take things for granted.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Not just plants.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> That's absolutely true
of life all together.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Goethe does provide
a kind of transition,

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:10%
a foundation for transition
between conventional day

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:10%
consciousness and what Steiner
calls ultimately his spiritual

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:10%
science.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, a way of
engaging the world of spirit,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the world of our own
inner experiences,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
with as much surety and clarity
as we do the outer world.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.185 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to remind you of
what we saw the very beginning

00:22:03.185 --> 00:22:03.985 align:middle line:90%
of our class.

00:22:03.985 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there was a little
Wimshurst machine here

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to do
something very similar.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Slightly different
geometry, but basically--

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Arthur Zajonc is an
American professor of physics

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Alongside his
interest in Steiner,

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:10%
and through his connection with
the work of the Dalai Lama,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:10%
he is a pioneer in bringing
the practice of meditation

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:10%
into academic circles.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:10%
I asked Arthur to explain
the young Steiner's interest

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:10%
in the philosopher
Emmanuel Kant,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:10%
and in particular Steiner's
rejection of Kant's hugely

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:10%
influential utterances on
the limits to knowledge.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The limits, the so-called
limits to knowledge,

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
are really the
limits of a horizon.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you stand
on a mountaintop,

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
you see further than if
you're down in the valley.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, but you've got to get
to the mountaintop, right?

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you could say there
are limits to knowledge

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:84%
if you're in a
particular location,

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:84%
but there's nothing to keep
you from developing yourself

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to a higher extent.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like climbing the
mountain and seeing further.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:90%
They'll still be a horizon.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So you'll still
experience a limit.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But the limit is a
subjective limit,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and not an objective statement
about the way the world

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:90%
is organized.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you could say
Steiner recognized

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
that there are in the moment
certain limits to knowledge,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
but that these are not
part of our human nature.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Human nature is, in some
ways, inexhaustible.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything that can be known
can be known by the human being.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
We are in that sense
in the image of God,

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:84%
we are filled with the
potential for the most

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
profound and extraordinary
way of knowing.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I looked at it more carefully
and then saw in its leaves it

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:90%
does something incredible--

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that the lower leaves are long
stocked and kidney-shaped,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.702 align:middle line:90%
and they form a little rosette.

00:24:05.702 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
There are only three
of them still alive.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:90%
There were more earlier on.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Then a little ways
up the main stem

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
you have the next leaf,
which also has a long stock,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
but is already in its blade.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Craig Holdrege has also had
a long interest in Steiner,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and through Steiner
into the work of Goethe.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
In upstate New York, he has
founded the Nature Institute,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:84%
where observation, the kind
of meditative observation

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that Steiner practiced over
many years, is explored.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We founded the Nature
Institute with the intention

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.380 align:middle line:10%
of having a place that can
cultivate a particular way

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:10%
of knowing that can bring us
back more in relationship with

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:10%
nature in the things themselves.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds very harmless
and simple and maybe not

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
even that important,
but if you think

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
about how strongly our
culture and our minds

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
are captivated with
certain abstract ideas,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and we notice that
people come to us

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
with many, many
abstractions in their minds

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
about what hormones do,
about what the brain does,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
about how natural selection has
made us this way or that way,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and we have all these
explanations of the world.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:90%
But do we see the world?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Do we experience
the world anymore?

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course with our
technologically dominated

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
culture this becomes
more and more an issue.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Goethe said
something like, if we

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
want to gain a living
understanding of nature,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:50.250 align:middle line:84%
we must make ourselves as mobile
and flexible as nature herself.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So science as transformation
of the human being

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand the living
character of the world--

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that's the mission of
the Nature Institute.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:84%
When Steiner came
across Goethe's work

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
when he was still a student at
the university in Vienna, what

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
he found in Goethe, what
stimulated him in Goethe,

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
was that here was a man
who really immersed himself

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
in the phenomenal world, didn't
have lots of abstract concepts,

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and thereby opened himself to
seeing relationships that spoke

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:90%
of more than the mere physical.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It is just unfortunate
today that we are so so

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:90%
much in a dualistic culture--

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
matter and mind,
body and spirit--

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
if we even think about
the one half, right?

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But if we do think about
the spiritual, or the soul,

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, then it's always
in contrast to the body.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But to see a unified
world, and that was really

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Steiner in his epistemology
based on Goethe

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:84%
was all about the one
world that we live in.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It is one world, and we
are part of one world,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and there aren't
two or three or 50.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:84%
There might be nuances
and different levels

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to call them,

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
different aspects that
one can gain access to,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:84%
but it is one manifoldly
differentiated world.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
In this approach to
understanding the world,

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.660 align:middle line:90%
you really do have to slow down.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:39.866 align:middle line:84%
So I sometimes thought about
this methodology or this aspect

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of the methodology,
that it would

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
be interesting to speak
like one speaks of slow food

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:84%
today and slow money, to
speak of slow science.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We need to slow down so that we
can really dwell in the things

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
as the basis of a deeper
understanding of the world.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Towards each
other, too, then.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in all respects.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I speak mainly about, when
I'm speaking about nature,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm also speaking about
my fellow human beings

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
in all our relationships,
this taking the time.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>> One set of relationships
that Steiner had while still

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:84%
studying in Vienna, and which
was to have far-reaching

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:84%
consequences, took
place in this building,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:90%
the home of the Specht family.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:10%
Steiner tutored the four
boys during his last six

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:10%
years in Vienna,
while at the same time

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:10%
studying and writing on Goethe.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Of particular concern
to his parents

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
was Otto, 10 years old
when Steiner first met

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
him, and considered by everyone
as both physically and mentally

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
abnormal, and
therefore uneducable.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
With Steiner's help, Otto's
condition gradually improved,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and eventually he
became a doctor.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
There is now a whole movement
for therapeutic education

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
in schools and
villages, not only

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:84%
here on the banks of the
Severn Estuary in England,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:90%
but all over the world--

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
a movement inspired by
the lectures Steiner

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:84%
gave in 1924, drawing
on his experience

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
with Otto, as well as
on his own insights

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
into the makeup
of the human being

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and the abnormalities
that can occur.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner's
own next challenge

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
was the editing of
Goethe's scientific papers,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
as well as writing his key
book, "The Philosophy of freedom

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
In 1891, at the
age of 30, he was

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
awarded a doctorate
of philosophy

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:90%
from the University of Rostock.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:10%
A year earlier, he'd
moved to Weimar.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:10%
It was to be a lonely
seven years working

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:10%
within the formality of the
Goethe-Schiller archives,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:10%
and with no one
with whom he could

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:10%
discuss his increasingly
rich inner life

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual experiences.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, his philosophical
writings and insights

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:90%
remained largely unrecognized.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I discovered Steiner
when I was in my early 20s,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was at Oxford
at the university,

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
in a highly intellectualized
environment, which I hated.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Studying?

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Studying philosophy, or
PPE, which includes philosophy.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Philosophy was the thing that I
was really interested and keen

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was just agony for me.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I hated it.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It was Bertrand
Russell and David Hume

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.362 align:middle line:84%
and every manner of reductionist
thinker that you could imagine.

00:30:48.362 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
real philosophy.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
across Steiner's work,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and it was a godsend to me,
because there was someone

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
talking about thinking, but
in a completely different way

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.330 align:middle line:84%
from the abstract,
intellectualized thinking

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that's practiced in
the universities.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe
what that view is then?

00:31:13.908 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:90%
What's this alternative?

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of Steiner's
key works is "The Philosophy

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
of Spiritual Activity" or
"Philosophy of Freedom."

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It has those two
different titles.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, he describes
how thinking as an activity

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
can be intensified, so that
becomes a kind of dialogue

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
with the world of spirit.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed to me to be
a path that I could follow.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you say
world of spirit,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.275 align:middle line:84%
that can sound pretty
weird to some people.

00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about
talking to spiritual beings,

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
or what do you mean by
the world of spirit?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, I do.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
It may well sound weird, but I
think that's the reality of it.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But of course, one's actually
in a kind of inner dialogue

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.080 align:middle line:90%
with a world of thoughts.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, what is
the source of our thinking?

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Where do our thoughts come from?

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a living
question, which I

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.860 align:middle line:84%
think anyone who's engaged with
that question of what thinking

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.479 align:middle line:90%
really is is obliged to ask.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And most people would
probably say that our thoughts

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
come from our brain.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people probably
would say that.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
that's actually correct.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And even to the
extent, of course,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
thinking is dependent
on our having a brain.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you cut my head off,
I wouldn't be able to think.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that the
source of thinking is material.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.605 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> How long must I be silent,
was the question that Rudolf

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Steiner was asking himself
as he reached the age of 40.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Unable still to share his
experiences of what he called

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:90%
[GERMAN], the spiritual world.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.840 align:middle line:84%
In 1897, he moved
to Berlin, initially

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to edit an avant garde literary
and theatrical magazine.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't only to
intellectuals and artists

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:90%
that he was drawn.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:10%
As a result, he was asked
to give courses in history

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:10%
at a worker's
educational institute,

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:10%
a post he held for seven years.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:10%
But among the citizens of
Berlin, as elsewhere in Europe

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.949 align:middle line:10%
and beyond, were an
increasing number

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:10%
of people interested
in spiritual teachings.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
theosophists, in a wisdom

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:90%
with its roots in the East.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Here at last was an audience
eager to listen to someone

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
not just speaking
out of the past,

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:90%
but out of his own inner vision.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
But what was becoming the
most powerful experience

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
of all finally brought
about the break with many

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
of these early followers.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:10%
For the theosophists,
Jesus Christ

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:10%
was just one of many great
teachers throughout history.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.360 align:middle line:84%
For Steiner,
Christ's incarnation

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
as a deed of huge
cosmic significance

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:84%
became a powerful and
transformative experience.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a sectarian
understanding of Christ.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think he not wanting
to associate Christ

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
too closely with the
Christian church.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think the
Christian church, sadly,

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:10%
is all too sectarian sometimes.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
For Steiner, it's a strong
view of how humanity as a whole

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:90%
is transformed by Christ.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Fraser Watts is a priest
in the Church of England,

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and someone with a long interest
in the work of Rudolf Steiner.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
He is also a fellow of
Queen's College Cambridge,

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and reader in
theology and science.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been quite a big
tendency in the 20th century

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to do a retreat to some kind
of subjective or existential

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:90%
understanding of Christianity.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But Steiner is absolutely going
in the opposite direction.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
For him, it is just
an objective fact

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that the evolution of
human consciousness

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
was changed by Christ.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, take it or leave it.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Even if no one had
known about that,

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:84%
even if there had never been
any one of Christian faith,

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:84%
for Steiner, I think
that transformation

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness
would still

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:84%
have happened as a result
of the work of Christ.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:21.530 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The church at Pottschach, in
the village where Steiner lived

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:90%
until he was eight years old.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
As a child and
throughout his life,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:84%
he was drawn to a great variety
of people, priests included.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:10%
In his autobiography,
he describes his father

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:10%
as a free thinker.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:84%
For Steiner himself, what
increasingly mattered

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was knowledge, but
the kind of knowledge

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
in which science and
religion, faith and reason,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.590 align:middle line:90%
are not at odds.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
A scientist of the invisible
is how he has sometimes

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:90%
been described.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the distinctive
thing about Steiner's approach

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to that is to want to find
some scientific approach

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.265 align:middle line:84%
to religious and
spiritual questions.

00:37:08.265 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:10%
There are different ways of
bringing science and religion

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:10%
into dialogue, but I
think that's what's

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:10%
distinctive-- to
approach, I think

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:10%
he would say the spiritual
rather than the religious,

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:10%
but to approach the spiritual
in a scientific way.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:84%
He clearly has
exceptional powers.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so unusual,
it's hard to know quite

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:90%
how to characterize those.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But he's clearly some
kind of clairvoyant.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's unusually
disciplined and highly

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
trained in the way he uses
those clairvoyant powers.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And he has such a
serious sense of purpose

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to leave the world a
better place as a result

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of his mission, and
arising out of that,

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:84%
all this great outpouring
of practical activity.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know of
anyone else who spans

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
all those things, really--

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:84%
has the exceptional powers,
is so disciplined with them,

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:90%
so purposeful, and so practical.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
unique contribution.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is Steiner not
better known, do you think?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting question
why Steiner isn't better known.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
various reasons.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
There's something off-putting
about his writings.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
has to be said.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What, his style, you mean?

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Style and content, I think,
and also something off-putting

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:44.180 align:middle line:84%
about the society, the kind of
following that he has sometimes

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:84%
built up around him, which can
look rather to cult-like from

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:90%
the outside--

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:84%
not at all what he
wanted, I think,

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.570 align:middle line:90%
but it can look like that.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The network of people
interested in Steiner's ideas

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:90%
is worldwide and growing.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Here in Hyderabad in South
India, several hundred

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
are gathering for a conference
of the Asia-Pacific region

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Anthroposophical
Society, anthroposophy

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:84%
being the name Steiner
chose for his movement

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.270 align:middle line:84%
after his break with
the theosophists.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Most if not all of
these people would

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.050 align:middle line:84%
reject the notion of a cult,
in that as teachers, farmers,

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.290 align:middle line:84%
doctors, and therapists,
although interested and

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:84%
inspired by Steiner's
insights, they are working hard

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to make these insights their
own and to take them further,

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as to learn from
important developments

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
in education, science, medicine,
and psychology since Steiner's

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:90%
death nearly 100 years ago.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm originally from the UK.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:10%
I met anthroposophy
33, 34 years ago

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:10%
in a school for handicapped
children near Reading.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's now a Waldorf School.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:84%
At that time it was a
special school, some severely

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:90%
disadvantaged children there.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I worked as the gardener,
and my wife worked as the cook.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And for me, meeting the
work of Rudolf Steiner

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.900 align:middle line:84%
was like finding
water in the desert.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of my teaching in
Waldorf education has been

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:90%
in Australia.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the last few
years of still teaching

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
in Australia in the
'90s, I already started

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to come to Asia
during my holidays,

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and made contact with various
very grassroots initiatives

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:90%
beginning the Waldorf Schools.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And little by little
this grew, and now I

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.960 align:middle line:90%
work full-time really.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm particularly now
in China and Taiwan.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:58.253 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the response
then to Steiner in that part

00:40:58.253 --> 00:40:59.180 align:middle line:90%
of the world?

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exploding.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It's phenomenal
what is happening

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:90%
in China at the moment.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say the people who
come to the training courses

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and seminars and
the initiatives that

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
have started in China, those
people I would say are hungry.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
They're really hungry to
find meaning in their lives.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:84%
They are hungry to connect
with the outside world.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And they're deeply grateful.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:90%
That is my experience.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.464 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
gives me energy.

00:41:28.464 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The mainstream education
in China is very, very tough,

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:39.230 align:middle line:10%
very, very competitive, and
you know that the children,

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:10%
they are forced to
study from very young,

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:10%
from kindergarten back
to three years old.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
parents realize

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:90%
this is not what they want.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, like the Waldorf
Schools and kindergartens,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:84%
most of the initiatives
are parents.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In India, as
elsewhere in the world,

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:84%
what increasingly concerns
many parents in particular is

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the stress that
children experience,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of the pressures
of living in the modern world,

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but also the pressure of having
to achieve, to score points,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
tick boxes, pass exams, all with
the aim of eventually getting

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:84%
a good job, but in the
opinion of many people,

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:84%
coming far too early
in their lives.

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
At Sloka's kindergarten
in Hyderabad,

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
the emphasis is on a very
simple and rhythmic routine

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of creative play and stories,
or simply having time

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.880 align:middle line:90%
to watch and wonder.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> As little children, they
cannot differentiate between

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:90%
play and work.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:10%
For adults, we know that there's
a play time and a work time.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But children, play
is as important,

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:90%
because it's all imitation.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They imitate whatever they see.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if
I'm cutting fruit,

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
they could be cutting
an imaginary fruit.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:90%
But they're actually doing it.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It would look as play for us,
but for them it's real work.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What Steiner emphasized when
he founded the first Waldorf

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
School in 1919 in Stuttgart
was that childhood has distinct

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.610 align:middle line:84%
phases, and the children not
only have to grow up and learn

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:50.140 align:middle line:84%
the ways of the world, but also
need time and space so that

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:84%
what each one brings into the
world can unfold harmoniously.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Trailing clouds of glory
is how Wordsworth expressed

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.590 align:middle line:84%
it, though some of the
baggage we carry on our backs,

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:09.284 align:middle line:84%
maybe from past lives, is
often far from glorious.

00:44:09.284 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING)

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Simple and unhurried--

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:84%
it is this atmosphere
that is attracting

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:84%
more and more parents
to Waldorf kindergartens

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Here in upstate New York in
the Hawthorne Valley Waldorf

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:33.220 align:middle line:84%
School, I came across
this growing awareness

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.970 align:middle line:84%
that if childhood is eroded,
we are diminished as adults.

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a story, I think
it's from Zorba the Greek,

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:10%
about him holding a butterfly
that's just come out

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:10%
of a cocoon and
wanting to see it fly.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So he tries to blow
on the wings to dry

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the wings before their
time, before they're

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:84%
really strengthened and ready,
and the butterfly ends up

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.110 align:middle line:84%
crumbling and unable
to really fly.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's time was
not yet come for it.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:90%
So we're giving children time.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Steiner
never visited America,

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
but he did travel extensively in
Europe during the last 20 years

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
or so of his life, delivering
over 6,000 lectures,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:84%
as well as writing books, plays,
and a collection of meditative

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.800 align:middle line:90%
verses.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Walter Kugler is in charge
of the archive related

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to Steiner's work up
until his death in 1925.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's housed in the
basement of this building,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:84%
across the meadow from the
Goetheanum in Switzerland,

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
Anthroposophical Society

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:90%
that Steiner founded.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It replaced an earlier
wooden building

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
which Steiner
designed and worked on

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.640 align:middle line:84%
with an international group of
helpers for nearly eight years,

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and which was destroyed by
fire on New Year's Eve in 1922.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Steiner drew up plans
for the replacement,

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:84%
this time made not out
of wood but of concrete.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But he never lived to
see its completion.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:10%
In the following years he
traveled all over Europe,

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:10%
lecturing and writing on
esoteric subjects such as karma

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.780 align:middle line:10%
and reincarnation
and cosmic evolution,

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.590 align:middle line:10%
as well as planting seeds,
practical indications

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:34.410 align:middle line:10%
for renewal in all areas of
human life, including the arts.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But Steiner was
not only occupied

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
with sharing his increasingly
profound spiritual experiences

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and with the creation of new
architectural and sculptural

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.090 align:middle line:84%
forms inspiring artists such
as Kandinsky and Joseph Beuys.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:90%
[BELL RINGING]

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Despite problems
with his health,

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:01.990 align:middle line:84%
he continued to travel, here on
a visit to North Wales in 1923.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:84%
By now he was becoming deeply
concerned about the situation

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.700 align:middle line:84%
emerging in the aftermath
of the First World War,

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:84%
politically, socially,
and economically.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.560 align:middle line:10%
>> He feels that humanity
is in a great battle,

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:10%
and he's trying to help, really
trying to save evolution from

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.510 align:middle line:10%
the dead end.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:10%


00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Or one-sidedness.

>> One-sidedness is a dead end.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:10%
If it's unbalanced, it
will break, it will crash,

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.710 align:middle line:10%
and it will bring
terrible suffering.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, Steiner feels
we have already been

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:90%
through terrible suffering.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.240 align:middle line:84%
There is terrible suffering
in the world-- cruelty.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.650 align:middle line:84%
People starving--
that's an unbalance.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So he was very
interested in economics

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and in the proper way for a
government and a community

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:03.780 align:middle line:84%
to form in order to
really to save people

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.900 align:middle line:84%
from starvation, and also
from meaningless work--

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.961 align:middle line:90%
great concern.

00:48:12.961 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He's not a Marxist, but
he drank from that cup.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.020 align:middle line:84%
He knew Marx's
critique of capitalism

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.450 align:middle line:90%
has some profound truth to it.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a cruel system.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Totalitarianism is also cruel.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.250 align:middle line:84%
We haven't found
an uncruel system,

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:84%
but that's what he
was looking for,

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
where the economic,
the political, and then

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the whole cultural sphere
would work collaboratively

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.030 align:middle line:84%
in their respective
spheres without anyone

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.046 align:middle line:90%
taking over the other.

00:48:49.046 --> 00:48:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the West,
but particularly

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.360 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
the economic, of course,

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is just far more powerful
than the other spheres,

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:03.490 align:middle line:84%
controlling education,
even religion.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.315 align:middle line:90%
For him this is a great concern.

00:49:05.315 --> 00:49:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Economics points to banking.

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And the concern expressed by
Steiner nearly 100 years ago,

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and echoed by Robert McDermott,
that the economic sphere

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:84%
has got too big for its
boots, has increasingly

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:90%
become the concern of many.

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Here in London at the
client day of the UK branch

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Dutch-based Triodos Bank
are both customers and bankers

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.100 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to work in a
different way with money--

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
greater transparency,
greater responsibility,

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and greater consciousness
of how the money deposited

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.890 align:middle line:90%
is actually used.

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Peter Blom is chairman
of the executive board

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.360 align:middle line:90%
of Triodos Bank.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm convinced that banks
should look more and what is

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.675 align:middle line:84%
really needed in society,
and then make out of that

00:49:56.675 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:90%
a feasible business.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.402 align:middle line:84%
And that you need some
profit, of course,

00:50:00.402 --> 00:50:01.610 align:middle line:90%
you cannot do without profit.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.980 align:middle line:90%
But you don't start with profit.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:10%
Profit is the
result. And I think

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:10%
that was also something
that relates strongly

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.730 align:middle line:10%
to what Steiner always said.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Profit is not something
you aim for, profit

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.905 align:middle line:84%
is something that is a sign
of a healthy operation.

00:50:19.905 --> 00:50:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It's emerging from
healthy transaction.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is a much better
way of looking at profit

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.675 align:middle line:84%
than putting it there as
a goal, as an objective,

00:50:30.675 --> 00:50:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and make everything
work for that goal.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.760 align:middle line:10%
With Steiner, he always
had the human being

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.150 align:middle line:10%
in the back of his mind when
he was talking about economics,

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.940 align:middle line:10%
about medicine, or whatever.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is an important
element that we can learn about.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
the thinking now,

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:53.870 align:middle line:90%
we exclude the human being.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about a system,
and the human beings

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.310 align:middle line:90%
who fit into the system.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And what he did
was saying, well,

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:05.330 align:middle line:84%
let's take each human
being as a starting point.

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's design
something around it,

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:84%
what can work to
serve human beings.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And that deeper principle,
I think, is quite important.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot achieve that by
just copying what he has said,

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.930 align:middle line:90%
or just repeat what he has said.

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the challenge,
maybe not so much for him,

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:84%
but for us to work with
what he has brought to us.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What Steiner brought
was frequently in response

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to questions and to
requests from individuals

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:90%
or professional groups--

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:41.050 align:middle line:84%
teachers, farmers, priests,
artists, and doctors.

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:45.190 align:middle line:10%
In April 1921, he gave a
three-week lecture course

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:48.250 align:middle line:10%
for a group of medical
practitioners in Dornach,

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:10%
his base in Switzerland,
during which he

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:10%
gave the first detailed
and systematic introduction

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:10%
to anthroposophic medicine,
and also spoke about mistletoe

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:10%
as a remedy for cancer.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.000 align:middle line:84%
The essence of all
such gatherings

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.850 align:middle line:84%
was the quest for a deeper
understanding of the human

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:84%
being, without
which, said Steiner,

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.490 align:middle line:84%
it has actually become
impossible to investigate

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of
health and disease.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Steiner worked closely with
the Dutch doctor Ita Wegman

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.080 align:middle line:84%
in bringing his insights
about health and disease

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.450 align:middle line:90%
into practical application.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And already back in 1912,
together with his second wife,

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Marie von Sievers, and in
connection with the mystery

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.930 align:middle line:84%
plays he was
writing, Steiner had

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
brought into being a new art
of movement, both as a therapy

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and as an art form,
that he called eurythmy.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:84%

and we are working with music,

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:26.610 align:middle line:84%
but in such a way that we try
to be music and be speech.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.200 align:middle line:10%
Being music is more
understandable,

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.910 align:middle line:10%
because you have ballet--

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.460 align:middle line:10%
they work with music.

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really
go into the laws,

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.080 align:middle line:84%
if you can say
that, of the music,

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
the different
elements of the music.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But in tone eurythmy, you go
into all the elements of music,

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.772 align:middle line:90%
and you become them.

it visible song.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So that what is singing,
what you hear in the music,

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that is what we are
trying to express.

to waken people's
awareness to what

heaven or earth, but
rather spirit and matter.

of diligent meditation

Steiner developed the
natural clairvoyance

he was born with into a faculty
that made possible what he

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.320 align:middle line:84%
called spiritual science,
a way of seeing open to us

all that goes beyond
our sense impressions

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and a narrowly
focused intellect.

To help awaken the

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual
in the universe is

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.580 align:middle line:90%
how he once described his task.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the human
being is potentially,

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.020 align:middle line:84%
as the ancients taught, a
microcosm of the macrocosm.

but he paid the price.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.740 align:middle line:84%
He had stuck his head
above the parapet,

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and was shot at from
many directions.

In the 10 or so years to come,
until his premature death

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:47.050 align:middle line:84%
in 1925 at the age of
64, there were indeed

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.450 align:middle line:90%
