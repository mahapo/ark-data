>> Conventional medicine didn't
really play much of a role

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:90%
in my healing.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, actually
what healed me, how I healed

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
myself was through a combination
of eating really high quality

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
foods and the combination
of not eating at all.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:90%
We're looking for the quick fix.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for
that magic bullet.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably as close
to an easy, simple, free magic

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:90%
bullet that ever existed.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I got more mobility change in
two days of water fasting than

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I did in three weeks of therapy.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And my therapist, last Thursday,
my fourth day into it, he says,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.722 align:middle line:90%

>> The advice we give to cut
a few calories is a complete

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:28.385 align:middle line:90%
failure.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If you compare a population
of people who never dieted

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
to a population of
people who diet,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the dieters end up weighing
significantly more than

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the non-dieters five
or 10 years later.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So we need to find
new solutions.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:10%
>> When someone does fasting,
it's very different than when

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:10%
someone simply cut calories.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:10%
>> So when you fast,
you can look at studies,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:10%
and you will see that the basal
metabolic rate does not go down

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:10%
nearly as much as the
calorie restriction.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There's always a sweet
spot for everything.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
If you fast for too
long, we'll will

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
say if you go out more
than say even 10 days,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:90%
your metabolism will slow.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
happens to people

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:10%
if they try to cut calories
for a very long period of time.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Their metabolism slows.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you start refeeding,
you will regain the weight

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.198 align:middle line:90%
and regain it very quickly.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a difference in fat.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The fat that you
carry around the waist

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:90%
is much more dangerous for you.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
This study was just
published last year.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at trunk of
fat mass, caloric restriction

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
versus alternate
daily fasting, fasting

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
was six times better at getting
rid of the dangerous fat.

>> The plan is to
do a seven day fast.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I went seven days,
and I lost 20 pounds.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought no way could I
go this far and not be hungry.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people noticed
the past couple days

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:90%
how thin that I look already.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
it I'm on day 21 of my 21 day
fast, and I've lost 33 pounds.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Your mind is more clear.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You're actually
going to be more alert.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You can have more
energy and more time.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been skiing
for three hours.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't
eaten for six days,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:90%
but I feel plenty energized.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Woo-who.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm almost on
vacation by not eating.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancient Greek
mathematician Pythagoras,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:10%
in fact, he required his
students to fast before they

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.345 align:middle line:10%
came into the classroom.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, he thought they
wouldn't be smart enough

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:10%
to figure out what he's doing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So my mind feels as
good as it's ever felt.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at fasting,
it's going to give you

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
the ability to do all those
things at a higher level than

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.338 align:middle line:90%
you've ever done them before.

00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people ask
me, how do you stay so fit

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.085 align:middle line:90%
at 44-years-old?

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And I quite simply
look them in the eye

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and I say, fast before
fitness is the ticket.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Activating your body, the
sympathetic nervous system

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
noradrenaline, and
growth hormone,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
all go up during a fast.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:10%
You actually can workout
harder than you've ever done.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always worked out on
an empty stomach in a fasted

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.983 align:middle line:84%
>> The challenge is about
fasting is that there's a lot

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
of misinformation out there.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
different types.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, whether you're
talking about an overnight fast

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:10%
or you're talking
about a 24 hour fast.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about 5
day, or 10 day, or 20 day?

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
People and journalists
and everybody

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
likes to use the same word.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
confusing, because each

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
turns on a completely
different process.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> This is happening now in
practices like mine all over

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
the country and in the
world, people learning.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll
all communicate.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beauties
of a film like this

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it will bring
attention to the whole concept

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of fasting, because so many
people know nothing about it.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.126 align:middle line:10%
>> For the last 50
years, we've told people,

00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:58.265 align:middle line:10%
eat six meals a day.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.517 align:middle line:84%
Eat the minute that you get up
within 30 minutes of getting up

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and make sure you eat a bedtime
snack so you don't get hungry.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Problem is when you start eating
the minute you get up and don't

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
stop eating until the
minute you go to bed,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you're constantly telling your
body to store food energy.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can either only
either store it or burn it.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't do both at once.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And even now, many personal
trainers and nutritionists will

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
tell try to eat something in
every two to three hours you

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:90%
are awake.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And if we are
awake for 18 hours,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
then that's a long
period of eating.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Our problem is
eating all the time.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So the very word
itself, breakfast,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
is the meal that
breaks your fast.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
very interesting word,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
because what it
means is that fasting

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:90%
is a part of everyday life.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's something you need
to do every single day,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.952 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
flip side of eating.

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
B side of eating.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
scary about fasting.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you fast for 12
hours and eat for 12 hours

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or eat for 10 hours and fast
for 14 hours, for example,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:90%
you'll stay in balance.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what they did
in 1960s America.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%
You can look back at surveys.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And the average number of meals,
1977, is three meals a day.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in the 1970s,
breakfast, lunch, dinner,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:90%
nothing else, snacks, no.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:90%
They're eating white bread.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no whole wheat pastas.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:90%
They're eating Oreo cookies.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They're eating ice cream, but
there's very little obesity.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you go to 2005
and the survey,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
the NHANES survey, which
is a large American survey

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of things,
including dietary habits,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
says that we're eating
six times a day.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, look at my
son's schedule, breakfast,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
mid-morning snack, lunch,
after school snack, dinner--

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:90%
oh, hey, he's playing soccer--

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
there's snack between the half
of soccer, six times a day,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So he's giving his
body instructions

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.417 align:middle line:84%
to store fat every minute
of that waking day.

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder why
is he gaining weight.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's no mystery.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You're eating all the time.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We would never even consider
starting to cook until 7:30.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And we usually eat around 8:00.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We might get home and eat at
8 or 9 o'clock and have a big

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:90%
meal at 8:00 or 9:00.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was a grazing after
dinner that was going on.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the length of time that
you let your body kind of burn

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:90%
that you've taken.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That's basically it.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
You're giving your
body time to digest it.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>> If you have them continue
their same type of food intake

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:10%
and about the same
number of calories,

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:10%
but you shrink that eating time
down, they will lose weight.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:90%
And they'll feel satisfied.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And they won't feel miserable,
because we didn't put

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:90%
them a the 1,600 calorie diet.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I've not
necessarily eaten well.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.425 align:middle line:84%
I've been overweight
sometimes up to 200 pounds.

00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Like everybody else, I've
gained a pound or two a year

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:90%
since I was 30.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> About three years ago, I was
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:90%
My A1C was over 14.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea that it
was out of control the way

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:90%
that it was.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I'd probably had
it based on the symptoms.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So I just tried to control
it with diet, medication,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:84%
but in the end, it just
wasn't working for me

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:90%
what I was doing.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.018 align:middle line:84%
So I decided it was time
to switch doctors, got

00:08:23.018 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:90%
a recommendation to Dr. Julie.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And she rocked my world.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> First, came upon that
study, Dr. Panda's study,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
it was very easy to understand.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It's so elegantly
done, that someone

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
who's not in high level research
could understand this paper.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Big gnarly study
with a lot of detail,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
tons of charts and graphs, big
words and back and forth with

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.342 align:middle line:90%
Wikipedia.

00:08:45.342 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Took like four hours to
get through that study.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.675 align:middle line:84%
>> I embrace the information,
because it's something new.

00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is a void in
most people's knowledge

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
base in terms of
nutrition and diet.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And it does sort of
dispel this myth that you

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
need to eat before
bedtime or you

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.908 align:middle line:84%
need to have protein before
bedtime to build muscle mass.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So on the flight
back to the West Coast,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I read it again for four hours.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It was on that flight that
I said, I got to try this.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So this simple experiment
that we did was we took

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
genetically identical
set of mice.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> One group was
eating ad libitum.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So they got to eat their
food throughout the day

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:90%
whenever they wanted to eat it.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're both
these groups of rats

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:90%
are on a super size me diet.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, like that
guy from that movie.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I started with
a high fat diet,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
because there are 11,000
research papers published

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
so far, where animals or humans
are given this fatty food.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And this fatty food
causes different diseases

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
starting from diabetes,
obesity, liver damage, cancer,

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and IBD, inflammatory
bowel disease, et cetera.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The lead mouse without
a doubt became obese,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:90%
gained weight.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The lean between mouse that was
on that time-restricted regime

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
actually stayed lean.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
caught my attention.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So even though they eat
the same amount of calories,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
at the end, the time-restricted
eating mice are lean compared

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
to the ad lib fed mice.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.778 align:middle line:84%
>> And they could stay
progressively fitter.

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And all they had to do
with change when they eat,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:90%
not what they eat.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Your body needs a
daily fasting period.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And that eating irradically and
kind of eating all over the day

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.818 align:middle line:84%
takes away from our
body's natural rhythms

00:10:26.818 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
to say this is when we
eat, this is when we rest,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's hitting a
manual override button.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We work with the
circadian rhythm.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are on
a clock basically,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
which is aligned with the 24
hour rotation of the Earth.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The circadian rhythm and
turning on and off of more than

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
10,000 genes is the largest
regulatory network that we know

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:90%
that exist in human.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Circadian rhythms in
the liver, the pancreas,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:10%
and the fat cells get
tremendously disrupted when you

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:10%
eat late at night or when you
eat for more than 12 hours

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:10%
during the day.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So if the liver clock
tracks when we eat,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
then forget about light, dark,
but we have to more careful

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
about is when we eat
and when we fast.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to stay in
beat with earth in order to be

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So we really should
stop eating by 7

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
PM at the latest, because
our pancreas goes to sleep.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Just before you wake
up, somewhere around 4 AM,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
growth hormone, adrenaline,
and so on all get pumped up.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.163 align:middle line:84%
You're basically activating
yourself for the day.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So for all those
people who say, oh, you

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
have to get up and
eat because you're not

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
going to have energy, like your
body has already prepared you

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
for everything
you're going to do.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to do it again.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And so during the day,
we need to be able to go out

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and hunt and get our food.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.513 align:middle line:84%
And do all those
kinds of good things.

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:90%
So we need access to energy.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:10%
We need to be able to
metabolize energy quickly.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we think we need to
be able to make sugar

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And we also need to be able
to oxidize fats for energy.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So at night, we can't absorb
the fat, and the salt,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and the sugar.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.657 align:middle line:84%
Your body just
takes it and shoves

00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
it right into a fat
store in the evening.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Once we get ready for bed, our
body switches to another mode.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And the circadian rhythms for
processing energy go down.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And the circadian
rhythms that help

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
with the repair of the
body, finding cancer cells,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:84%
renewing all of the
bodily systems kick in.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And those are the strongest
during the night, immune system

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:90%
function, et cetera.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
If you eat during the
night, you disrupt

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:90%
all of those mechanisms.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And so not only are you
predisposing yourself

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to diabetes and obesity
and hypertension,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:84%
but you're also
predisposing yourself

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to a pro-inflammatory condition
throughout the body, which

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
makes it easier for
cancer to take hold.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're trying
to repair a highway,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:90%
you have to stop the traffic.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, our body cannot
repair itself if we continue

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
to eat.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> The body makes less insulin.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So for the same sugar load
that you would give yourself

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
during the day that would not
cause your blood sugar to rise

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
significantly, that
same sugar load

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
after about 7 or
8 o'clock at night

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
will cause a significant
rise in your blood sugar,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
mimicking the
effects of diabetes.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> With a study that came out in
a neurology journal that found

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
if you were giving artificial
nutrition in the hospital,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that patients did better if
you didn't give it around

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
the clock.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
They gave the nutrition
in a shortened frame.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They're connecting the
person back to the day cycle.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:90%
They have a better outcome.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I just haven't weighed
myself this morning.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, two months
now have gone by.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've dropped to somewhere
in the neighborhood of 29 pounds

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
just with Dr. Julie.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't hard to do, because
it was just a small habit change

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:90%
that I had to ask them to make.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
All they had to
do was apply this

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
shortening their total time
of eating during the day.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Dr. Julie.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.974 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming today.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go
over your blood test.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:90%
And you had them drawn already.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So when I have people come
in and they'll tell me,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, my parents
have high blood pressure

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
so that's probably
why I have it.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not always a genetically
inherited problem.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's possibly a lifestyle
inherited problem,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
because we carry
with us the type

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
of habits that our parents
brought us up to have.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And if late night
eating and indulging

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
slightly on the weekends was
something that we saw them do

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
or that we were allowed
to do growing up,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.685 align:middle line:84%
we're going to carry
that habit with us.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And that first
night was a struggle.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting off
my plane down in Burbank

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and getting ready to take
an hour and a half drive

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
to Santa Barbara
and thinking, OK,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
where am I going to stop to get
something sweet for the road.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I went, wait,
it's past 6 o'clock.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And I found that the first
week was very uncomfortable.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went to bed
with hunger pains.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's all I
could do to stay

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
on this time-restrictive
eating time frame

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
was to go to bed early so
that I wouldn't feel hungry.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And Dr. Julie had given me
the advice that the first two

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
weeks we're going
to be very hard.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>> After about a week, there
was hunger pains completely went

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And she was right, but I
was glad she shared that,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
because it prepared me.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And then after that,
it was no craving.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was really strange,
but cravings for food

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
later in the evening
just went away.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Your liver tests
look fantastic.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were
lower than they

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:90%
were before the previous time.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're fatty liver
is completely reversed.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a totally
normal liver enzymes.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And you did it purely by
just lifestyle changes.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple
of months, you can

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%
have reversal of fatty liver.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
You can start seeing
blood sugar changes

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:90%
in less than two months.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
better than medicine.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Debra was a new patient to me.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My concern is that I've
been told I should take blood

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
pressure medicine to
control my blood pressure.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Her one fear was being
on a blood pressure medicine

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of her life.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's gotten in had
gotten in the 150s and 160s.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And her blood pressure was
running in the hypertensive

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
range.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.985 align:middle line:90%
So she was running over 140.

00:16:38.985 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I just didn't like
the side effects.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I was falling
asleep at the wheel.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And she was given the
recommendation of trying

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to just restrict her eating
time to about 11 or 12 hours.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later, she came
in and her blood pressure

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
was normal, 120s
to 130s systolic.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> My blood pressure read--

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if have
it-- it was is 126 over--

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> 70.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.617 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been that for a while.

00:17:07.617 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And she came in again a
few weeks later and her blood

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
pressure was normal again.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like your daily medicine.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
These medical conditions, we
should be thinking about them

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
as really symptoms.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really not
a medical condition,

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:90%
because it's totally reversible.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
You noticed a sleep improvement
with a diet in this lifestyle

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
change over some of the other
things you tried before.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And a much sounder sleep.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting,
because I hear

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.765 align:middle line:90%
people bring that up to me.

00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, she's not
a hypertensive patient

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I located Dr. Julie
Wei-Shatzel shots up and I said

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I really, really need to get
this weight under control.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:90%
It's out of control.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, would you be
interested in participating

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:90%
in a study?

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.822 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're trying to do
now is to expand this study.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The original study was done
in 150 adults in San Diego.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We are now running
a worldwide study.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:90%
We have almost 9,000 users.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> She explained to me about
the circadian clock app.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the launch of this
app, My Circadian Clock.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:10%
We have close to 10,000
people who have downloaded.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I downloaded his app.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I went
through the process

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:84%
of taking pictures of the
food that I ate every day.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And then also making
sure that I fasted

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
for a minimum of 12
hours each night,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:90%
like with dinner being at 6:00.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> First two weeks we asked you
to log everything you currently

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of those two weeks,

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
you get a summary of
everything that you've done.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of shocking to
see how much you forget.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you look back and
have the hard evidence,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:90%
it's really helpful.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Using that app is really to
me much more useful than using

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:10%
something like Fitbit, because
you're going to maximize

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:10%
your circadian rhythm.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.538 align:middle line:84%
And all of your organs
run on circadian rhythm.

00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the exciting
things that we've seen is that

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
people are pretty able
to adapt to this style.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
If we say you can still
have that piece of cake,

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
but you just can't
eat it after 6:00 PM,

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:84%
people are a lot
more open to that.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:10%
And they'll adjust when they
eat their types of food and say,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.868 align:middle line:10%
OK, you know what I can
have it in the morning.

00:19:06.868 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Within about eight months of
about a 12 hour fasting window

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
every day, I found that my
triglycerides have gotten well

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
below any number I had been
able to achieve previously.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I also found
that my A1C had also

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
fallen to the lowest point
it had been in years.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I realized so
much benefit so fast.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In the first 90 days,
I lost 11 pounds.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And in 180 days,
I lost 16 pounds.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm trim anyway.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I was 153 pounds when I started.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
As I got through
that, I wrapped myself

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
around the mantra of
don't change what you eat,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:90%
just change when you eat.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So I actually might have
started eating worse.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.182 align:middle line:84%
So I could have confounded
the study a little bit,

00:19:49.182 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
but by eating worse,
because I felt

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.307 align:middle line:84%
like I could eat
whatever I wanted and I

00:19:52.307 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:90%
was getting good results.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't dieting.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.355 align:middle line:84%
So after that study,
I met with Satchin

00:19:57.355 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:90%
and I asked him about that.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of chuckled
and laughed and said,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
no, Bill, don't eat whatever
you want, but do control

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.693 align:middle line:90%
when you eat.

00:20:05.693 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> My blood pressure
was elevated.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I was on medication for
high blood pressure,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:90%
as well as for cholesterol.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
The past year, since using
time-restricted feeding,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I have actually--

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:90%
I've lost 20 pounds.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:90%
My blood pressure is excellent.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm no longer
taking statin drugs.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Implementing time-restricted
feeding is an easy first step

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:90%
to take.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It has no cost.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It has no side effects.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's feel so much better
than taking medication.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2004, I decided to
take a personal challenge,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
try a triathlon.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I tried a half Ironman.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's a 50 mile bike
ride, a 1.6 mile swim.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was a 12.1 mile run.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
My performance has
degraded over the years

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
to where I'm doing
just sprint triathlons.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.052 align:middle line:90%
That's 1/4 of that half Ironman.

00:20:59.052 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
You would have
thought that I would

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
have progressed to actually
doing the full Ironman.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.300 align:middle line:90%
So I have it.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out that I
have a cardio condition, where

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:10%
my heart beats super
rapidly and irregularly,

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:10%
but what will
happen is it'll beat

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:10%
at 250 to 300 beats a minute.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a boat
cavitating a propeller.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't bite.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no blood
pumping through my heart.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I get all lightheaded,
and I might pass out.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It can happen anywhere.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I've progressively
been doing shorter and shorter

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:90%
distance triathlons.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
At the end of this
study, it was allowing

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
me to run longer and harder,
to ride farther and faster,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and to swim longer
and more smoothly.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.198 align:middle line:10%
And so I felt like this next
triathlon, I'll see how I do.

00:21:43.198 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went ahead and I
signed up for the Olympic.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a double
sprint triathlon.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the interesting
short of it

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
is, no cardiac
problems, completed

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:90%
the Olympic triathlon.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can just implement
that first portion of it,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
then the rest of the healthy
changes will come along.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> When you put the
mice on the treadmill,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
you know very well like you
would do for a human treadmill,

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
they run much longer when they
are on time-restricted feeding

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
then on ad lit feed control,
suggesting that there is some

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular benefits to
time-restricted feeding.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>> When I'm up in the morning.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm alert quicker
than I have been previously.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that obesity
is probably the single major

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
largest challenge in America
these days in terms of overall

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:90%
health and chronic disease.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The category of
people are very obese.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
necessarily consuming

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:90%
significantly more calories.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, these people
have some difficulty

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:90%
sleeping through the night.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And so if they're getting up
later in the evening or early

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.113 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, they'll
just go and have a snack.

00:22:54.113 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll have something to
eat or something to drink.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
That actually increases
their total eating time

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:90%
to much greater than 15 hours.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.085 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they may be
eating 20 hours a day.

00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Flying back on the plane,
I'm reading the study.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to understand
what's going on.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a third group of mice
that was really interesting.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:84%
They had a control
group that was

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
five days on the
time-restricted feeding regime

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and two days off.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is that might
mirror our five day working

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
schedule and our two
day off schedule.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've wanted to try with
you could party on the weekend.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So I had one group of
mice that were only

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
on time-restricted feeding
during the weekdays,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
but then they would have
full access, 24 hours

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
access to food
during the weekends.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.125 align:middle line:84%
So we call this the 5T2A
regimen for five days

00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
on time-restricted
feeding and two days

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:90%
ad lib starting on Friday night.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Good news is there's no
difference between being

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.640 align:middle line:84%
seven days in
time-restricted feeding

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
or only five day time-restricted
feeding, at least in mice.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.322 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a mice, you
can party on the weekend.

00:23:57.322 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> All of health care
should be embracing this.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:90%
We should be using this.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We're really not
telling people what to eat.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:84%
We're telling
people when to eat.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that this could
give us an excellent way

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to initiate a long-term
and effective treatment

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
for obesity.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if you eat healthy
foods after 7:00 PM,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:90%
you actually push your body.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You push your pancreas,
your beta cells,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and you actually become
more inclined to develop

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:90%
pre-diabetes and diabetes.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When we compare the high fat
diet fed animals and the ones

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.168 align:middle line:84%
that were on
time-restricted feeding,

00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:90%
there was a massive difference.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the ones on
time-restricted feeding,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
they don't have this type
2 diabetes problem anymore.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I've seen, when
someone adopts time-restricted

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
feeding, that's all
they need to do.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
That's all they need to
do to completely reverse

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
this hypoglycemia to
completely take them out

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
of this pre-diabetic state.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman who was running
pre-diabetic for two years.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We had her follow
time-restricted feeding

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:90%
for a few weeks.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And her blood sugar came back
normal, absolutely normal.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:90%
We tested her.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Again a few months later.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And her blood sugar was
again normal as well as

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
her hemoglobin A1C and
that hemoglobin A1C

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
is a marker for your blood sugar
over the past three months.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And so for her, the burden
of developing diabetes

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:90%
was completely lifted.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have to worry about
that disease entity anymore

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Diabetes is
completely off the chart.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Metabolic syndrome
is off the chart.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We can't solve that
with drug interventions,

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
but a cultural change, where
we learn to eat in a window

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that we were at before,
that seems kind of doable.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of thing
that a group could start.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
You could teach
children in school.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:90%
We could observe that at home.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:90%
We could walk the talk.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And that might make such a big
difference on a national scale

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
that it actually
moves the needle.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> If physicians are more
involved in helping people make

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
this lifestyle change, I think
it will be an overall cost

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:84%
savings for just
medicine in general,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to be
spending less on medication.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
spending less on disease.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, that Super Size Me
guy should do his whole routine

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, he should
do his whole eating

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
that Super Size Me diet, but
under a shorter time frame.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.273 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if he'd have
all those health effects.

really reversing all of type 2

diabetes and all its downstream
complications with fasting.

>> I've worked with Jason
for 17 years, nephrology.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're just watching our
patients die from diabetes,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
essentially watching them
get more and more obese,

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
watching their blood sugars get
worse, and worse, and worse.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Their medications
go through the roof.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Like they're on two or
three pages of medications.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And every time we saw
a patient, they're

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:90%
are more and more drugs.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%

holding their hand as they had

their heart attacks, as
they went on dialysis,

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
as they developed kidney
failures and strokes.

>> That's how we got into
this in the first place.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It was really
disheartening to watch

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
people die before our eyes.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:10%
>> So one day, I was
talking to a friend.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And she was talking
about doing a cleanse.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that really what
she's talking about is a fast.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, wow, that's
a really stupid idea,

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:10%
but then I thought for a second.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:10%
OK, well, this was
my initial reaction.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And most people have that same
sort of eye rolling reaction

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:90%
to the word fasting.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
but I'm a physician.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:10%
What exactly is it that's
so bad about the fasting,

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:10%
because she actually had
pretty decent results?

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:84%
She always says
she feels better.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't feel hungry.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.492 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, well,
that's very interesting.

00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:47.201 align:middle line:84%
So then I started to
look at the fasting.

00:27:47.201 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought, why not, like
why not have people fast?

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what honestly is
more obvious than fasting?

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:10%
If you don't eat, your
blood sugars will come down,

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:10%
and you no longer need
a diabetic medications.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:10%
Hey, that's great.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.970 align:middle line:10%
If you don't eat,
you will lose weight.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:10%
Hey, that's great.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Where is the downside?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Anne's hemoglobin A1C
was so high that the lab

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:10%
couldn't detect it.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Groups like Alcoholics
Anonymous and Weight Watchers,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
they're all
group-based sessions.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:10%
>> So, Anne, can you tell
us about your first fast?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
They're not individually
counseling sessions,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:84%
because you're losing a
very important support

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:90%
structure there.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:10%

to these kind of group sessions.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning, it's a pain
in the butt to get over that--

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:90%
the first two day hump.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
it's really easy.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:90%
It seems really easy.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can't believe
I'm not eating.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped at 10 days.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Since then you
haven't touched insulin.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:90%
You haven't needed to.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If I went Monday,
Wednesday, Friday,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:84%
but then you're going through
those hunger pains, you know,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:84%
where your stomachs growling,
you feel like you get ravenous,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.103 align:middle line:90%
like you could eat a horse.

00:29:09.103 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What reading did you
get this this morning?

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I got down to
6.4 in the morning.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So I started intermittent
fasting about five years ago.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And within six months, I had
reversed my hemoglobin A1C

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:90%
from 6.4% to 4.6% percent.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with fatty
liver disease when I was 12.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
In six months, no more
fatty liver infiltration.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I was
diagnosed with when I was 14

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:90%
was polycystic ovarian syndrome.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to
the hospital all

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
of the time from cyst rupturing
and it just being so painful.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't bear it.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
About six months into fasting,
everything sort of regulated.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw another
specialist later on, my OB,

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.192 align:middle line:90%
we started talking about it.

00:29:55.192 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said Megan,
when is the last time

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:90%
you had a cyst rupture?

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I know my periods
are regular now.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And so she's had me
for an ultrasound.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And everything and
atomically, there

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:84%
is no sign of polycystic
ovarian syndrome, none at all,

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty mind-blowing.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And my progesterone hormones
and all my fertility

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:90%
stuff, and it was all fantastic.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It was so much
better than it was

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.580 align:middle line:84%
when I was a teenager
in my early 20s

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:90%
when the had mentioned those.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So fertility for
me is not really

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:90%
going to be an issue anymore.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I spent most
of my life thinking

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't be
able to have babies.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
saw me improve.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's how we
got some initial success

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and how our program really
started to snowball.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
People just didn't want
to die from diabetes.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was
walking with a cane.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't breathing well.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:10%
I had put on 130 pounds
with the insulin.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Patients come back to
me with incredible stories.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I was taking 210
units of insulin a day.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I did the 21-day fast.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't had insulin since.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I've lost close to 100 pounds.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So every day I come in,
almost every single day I come

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
in and I say, wow, Mr. So-and-so
or Mrs. So-and-so, look,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
your numbers are such to
the point that you are not

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:90%
classified as diabetic.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.047 align:middle line:10%
>> It saved my life
is what it did.

00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Off the COVERSYL, too,
for your blood pressure.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:90%
So you're off of everything.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And around her waist, she
has lost 27 centimeters.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes people find that
when they fast that a lot

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of these cravings just stop.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my control
is vastly improved.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy is unbelievable.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I was
walking with a cane.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to treat
everybody as individuals.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.547 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:31:57.547 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So we see all different regimens
and use all different regimens.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I stop eating at about
7:00 in the evening.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And after that, it
should be just liquids

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:90%
until dinner the next day.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Avocado, slice it
up, with two eggs.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I will eat that maybe about
10 o'clock in the morning.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I do not eat again until maybe
3, 4 o'clock the next day.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
As terrible as it sounds,
I don't even feel hungry.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>> We can tailor it
to people's need.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:10%
If you need it for
weight loss, then I

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:10%
can give you something that's
going to do weight loss,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:10%
but you only want to do it
for, say, overall well-being,

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.090 align:middle line:10%
mental clarity, well, I'll
give you something different.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes seven
days, it depends.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
When I feel that is
a lot comfortable,

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:90%
then I will take longer one.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And the key rule, and
especially for the elderly,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:90%
is if you don't feel well stop.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Let us know.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's re-evaluate.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll have a dinner or lunch.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to take
36 or 24 hours fasting.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what I prefer.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But the financial benefits
are actually just mind-blowing,

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:90%
because think about it.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
You have type 2
diabetes, obesity.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.370 align:middle line:90%
You've got all kinds of cost.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a new consult a
couple weeks ago and he said,

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I watched my grandparents
follow the guidelines,

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:90%
and I watched them die.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I watched my parents
follow the guidelines.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm watching them die.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be dead 20
years before my grandparents.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And look at me now.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm diabetic.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I have fatty liver disease.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:90%
My eyesight is going to hell.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this to be me.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, what they're doing
and their method of treatment

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that these physicians
are having my--

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
or had my grandparents
follow and they're having

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:90%
my parents follow, don't work.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got your medications.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:90%
You've got surgeries.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You've got heart attacks, very
expensive, strokes, hospitals.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:90%
You've got stuff.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You need to pay
for nursing care.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
You need to pay
for nursing homes.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So an incredible
amount of cost all

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
built in to take care
of these sick people.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.929 align:middle line:84%
>> I watched my family
die from heart disease.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
I watched my grandmother
die from diabetes.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I watched my mother suffer
from diabetes following

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:90%
the guidelines to a T.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Clearly something
is broken there.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think people more so
than a lot of physicians

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:30.050 align:middle line:84%
understand that science
needs to evolve.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:35.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what if you can get rid
of all that for free, for free?

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:90%
That's just unbelievable.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd have money
to fight poverty.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have money for
education at the same time

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
that everybody's healthier
than they've ever been.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
>> And the crazy part is it
doesn't require anything,

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:84%
but the right knowledge, which
has the potential to save

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.200 align:middle line:90%
our entire nation's budget.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Having that diagnosis
of borderline diabetes

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and being told by my
family doctor that 6.4%,

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
that was scary.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I've had cancer.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And the diagnosis of diabetes
being delivered to me

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
was so much scarier to me
than the cancer diagnosis,

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.600 align:middle line:84%
because at least with
cancer, there's a shot.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
With diabetes, it's
a death sentence.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long painful slow,
progressive death sentence.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:10%
>> People sometimes say the
three most influential people

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:10%
in the history of the
world, Jesus Christ,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.070 align:middle line:10%
the prophet Muhammad, and Buddha
probably only agreed on one

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:10%
thing.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
power of fasting.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:90%

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Fasting is an essential
part of our Christian faith.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Christ started by
his own example.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
He also commanded his
disciples to fast.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:84%
When they were trying
to help other people out

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
so successful, he

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.412 align:middle line:84%
said these problems are only
resolved by fasting and prayer.

00:36:08.412 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The scriptures teaches that
there is some things you cannot

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:90%
do if you don't fast.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Miracles, some miracles
cannot happen without fasting.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Fasting is such a personal
experience for everyone who

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:90%
fasts.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And when it's coupled
with prayer, it changes--

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:90%
it changes our life.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I truly believe that fasting
can change people's heart.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:84%
In the scriptures from ancient
times to the present day,

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:90%
we read about those who fasted.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
fasting, they changed.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was living in Peru and
I made the decision to go

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:90%
to my mission.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:90%
My father didn't want me to go.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It was for safety reasons.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The country had a lot
of terrorism problems.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to talk
to my stake president,

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
he counseled me to fast and to
pray and then to talk to him.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:90%
I fasted, and I pray.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
to talk to my dad.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We cried together.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that, well,
let me go to my mission

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and that I will
have his support.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:26.620 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very meaningful
to me, because it was

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:90%
regarding my mission to serve.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And because of it,
my life changed.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It brings me closer to God.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel spiritual
strength coming to me,

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.880 align:middle line:90%
temporal blessings come from it.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Graduating from
high school I wanted

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to know which of
the two colleges

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I should go to that I
had been admitted to.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted
to be the right place.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And so as I prayed, I determined
fasting would really help me.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And so I fasted.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
At the closure of my fast, as I
prayed, it was very clear to me

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:90%
the choice that I should make.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We believe that it is
beneficial both spiritually,

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.760 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it has a
humanitarian benefit when

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.320 align:middle line:90%
coupled with helping the poor.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> A greater compassion
for those who are in need

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and the greater desire to
serve them comes from fasting.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We learn from the
ancient prophet Isaiah

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that God introduced fasting
to the children of Israel.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He even said this is the
fast that I've chosen

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and then goes on to
say that its purpose is

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:90%
to deal bread to the hungry.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:84%
We fast once a month for
a period of 24 hours, two

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:90%
consecutive meals.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And moneys that
are saved from that

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:84%
fast are donated to
the poor to help them

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
humanitarian needs, not enough

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.730 align:middle line:84%
money to pay the
electric bill, they

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
don't have the food
necessary for their children,

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
for clothing, et cetera,
to help them get themselves

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:84%
on their feet so they
can become self-reliant.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Every person has the
opportunity to fast.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And even the poorest
among us sometimes

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
will fast and give
what they can in order

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to help their
brothers and sisters.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There is seven billion
people in the world.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:84%
If we all did this, we
would end world hunger.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So I pretty much started
with very turbulent teen years.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I was 14 when I first
moved in with my boyfriend.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.868 align:middle line:84%
I was heavily into the
kind of drug party scene,

00:39:27.868 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
like drinking a lot of alcohol,
all that kind of stuff.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of nights up
partying in bars with fake IDs,

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:84%
drinking, not eating properly,
subsiding on processed food,

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:84%
eventually developing
septicaemia when I was about

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:90%
16.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It started from a really
bad case of pneumonia.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:84%
About 24 hours later,
I was in the hospital

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
on intravenous antibiotics for
swollen meninges of the brain,

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:84%
septicemia, multiple
organ failures,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and severe chronic disease.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.510 align:middle line:84%
My chances of survival
were actually only 40%.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Something changed.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably a
combination of everything

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that went on, but I remember
leaving the hospital.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't the same person.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Any like happiness
for life was gone.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I was very apathetic
and depressed.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I seemed to be really
struggling to believe

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
in a positive future for
myself and self-conscious

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and a lot more introverted.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
All of this sort of
made me focus on--

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
made me begin focusing
on what I felt

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I could control,
which is what I ate,

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
how I looked, how
other people saw me.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think I used
obsession with my body

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and controlling
my intake as a way

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to be accepted, feel
connected to the world

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and the environment to
be a part of something,

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.820 align:middle line:90%
to feel home somewhere.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking in the
mirror and hating my body

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and judging it so harshly.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of different
health conditions.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:84%
My main conditions I was
dealing with autoimmune thyroid

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
disease, extreme hypothyroid,
and thyroid goiter.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually very difficult
to swallow and eat food.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a gastroparesis, so
really slow stomach emptying

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and chronic stomach inflammation
and gastritis, probably

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.610 align:middle line:84%
from years of an eating
disorder and antibiotics

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff as well.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I had really bad
irritable bowel syndrome

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and chronic inflammatory
bowel disease.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was bloated all the time,
a lot of pain in the bathroom,

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:90%
more than anybody should be.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And my most painful
condition by far

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and what actually prompted me to
start my YouTube channel, what

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I really focused
on at the beginning

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.610 align:middle line:84%
was one of the top three most
painful conditions that exist.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was
interstitial cystitis.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a chronic
ulcerative bladder disease.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
The symptoms are a lot
of urgency, burning pain,

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:90%
but you have no life.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.780 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of housebound
and living in your bathroom

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of pain.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:84%
This is where I
lived for two years.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I was a prisoner
in my own bathroom.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had my identity stripped
by my eating disorder.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
have a life at all.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Anorexics fast all the time.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people may
justify fasting if they

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:90%
have an eating disorder.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They may say,
well, look, fasting

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.070 align:middle line:84%
is fixing all these
other medical problems.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.862 align:middle line:84%
We know that eating disorders
are medical and biological.

00:42:43.862 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
brain-based disorder.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe fasting will fix
my eating disorder.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, anorexics
fast all the time.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It makes their disorder worst.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.727 align:middle line:84%
Bulimics purge food
in a number of ways.

00:42:54.727 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Self-induced vomiting is the
one that people think about

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.477 align:middle line:84%
or misuse of laxatives, which
actually does nothing to get

00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:00.750 align:middle line:90%
rid of calories, by the way.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing that
bulimic do to purge is fast.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So both bulimics
and anorexics fast.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And it makes their
disorder worse.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It does not fix it.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We did see that in the
archaeological record.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Bulimics-- in a
member in Rome, they

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:20.280 align:middle line:84%
had the vomitoria where they
would eat and gorge themselves.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And then they'd go throw up.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the Romans and
the vomitoriums that they would

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
have was sort of a
different phenomenon.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:84%
That was much more
of a social activity,

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.583 align:middle line:84%
where people would go and
overindulge on purpose.

00:43:34.583 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
vomit in order

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to continue to be
able to do that.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Patients with bulimia, where
they will binge and then

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:84%
purge often by
vomiting, they find

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that both the binging and the
purging to be highly shameful.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They will go to great
lengths to hide this

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.080 align:middle line:84%
from their friends,
their family.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not something they
feel comfortable doing,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:90%
in generally, in public.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember the first
time I actually purged.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't with intent.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I literally had
eaten what I thought

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't after a
long time of anorexia,

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.730 align:middle line:84%
after many months of
really starving myself

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to the point of insanity.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:90%
And I remember I was so hungry.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't-- I gave in.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
physiological survival

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:90%
urge I couldn't ignore.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was so anxious
while I was eating that I

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:90%
felt such an upset stomach.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was doing
something so wrong.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards-- I mean, I
ate until I couldn't breathe.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't control myself.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- I was
like my body needed it.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt so
worried and panicky that I

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:84%
was going to gain
a ton of weight,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.320 align:middle line:84%
destroy everything
I had already done.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I came in the bathroom
really frantic and scared.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of leaned
over the toilet bowl.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was so painfully
full that just the act

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of leaning over, I mean, food
practically came up itself.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And it was so painful coming up.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It was like fire or lava
just shooting out of you.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I was
flooded with a sense of relief.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It was like I could get
rid of all the shame.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I could get rid of all
the pain in my life.

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I could just be back to
the way I was before.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I would feel
really panicky and shaky.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would wonder
if anybody hurt me.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would be afraid
that I smelled like vomit.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt really
dirty and really disgusting.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to pretend the
whole thing didn't happen.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So I would rush over to the sink
and just put so much toothpaste

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.770 align:middle line:90%
on my toothbrush.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was so afraid I
had like splatter on me.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I just felt so disgusting, I
guess, on such a deep level

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that I would sit-in the
bath for a long time.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And I would just run the
hot water over my hands

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and splash my face and just feel
really ashamed and embarrassed

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and hope that nobody ever
knew that I did this,

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because it felt like the most
despicable thing on planet

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When the recovery
battle began,

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I was 145 pounds and 6 foot 3.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And now I stand
today at 188 pounds.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I just had maybe a inferiority
complex, if you will.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.572 align:middle line:84%
I was bullied as a
little as a young kid

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and growing up
through high school.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And it always made me angry.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And it made me mad.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.408 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like, if I
could work out harder,

00:46:20.408 --> 00:46:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and if I could watch my
diet even tighter, that's

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.210 align:middle line:90%
a way to get back at everybody.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And it caused me to have
very bad social anxiety.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It just led me to a
life of isolation,

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
because I was afraid
that I was going

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to eat something
that was unhealthy,

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.300 align:middle line:84%
or I was afraid that I was going
to smell something and want

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.505 align:middle line:90%
it and not have it.

00:46:40.505 --> 00:46:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel
massive anxiety.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So I would just talk myself out
of not going to these places.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So I came home for
Thanksgiving one year.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And my brother
handed me this packet

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:90%
that said orthorexia on it.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.368 align:middle line:84%
And he threw it at me and
he said you have this.

00:46:53.368 --> 00:46:54.168 align:middle line:90%

>> (SINGING)

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Orthorexia is a condition where
you take things to the extreme.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I specifically remember
tracking my calories

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and burning approximately 1,800
a day and consuming only 1,400.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.052 align:middle line:84%
And if every day came where
those numbers were reversed,

00:47:29.052 --> 00:47:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I would get so
depressed and angry.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had to super
compensate the next day

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.092 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that I was burning
more than I was consuming.

00:47:36.092 --> 00:47:37.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that happens when

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.440 align:middle line:84%
you have an eating
disorder is you

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.540 align:middle line:84%
go into this specific
type of depression

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.528 align:middle line:84%
where you just don't find
pleasure out of things anymore.

(SINGING)

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.180 align:middle line:10%
The only thing that I
really found pleasure out of

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:10%
was exercising in huge amounts
and working out really hard

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:10%
and restricting my calories and
seeing how far I can actually

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:10%
push it or stretch it.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.640 align:middle line:84%
My emotions were
all over the place.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.820 align:middle line:84%
To say life became a struggle
is putting it lightly.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't go as far as
saying that I was suicidal,

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.085 align:middle line:84%
but I definitely had
given up on life.

00:48:31.085 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want
to live another day.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I literally would pray
that I would go over

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.000 align:middle line:84%
to the streets of Manhattan
in the afternoon to work

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and I would get hit by a
bus going out of control

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
or get killed in gang warfare
or get shot or stabbed to death.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.943 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say
my lowest point was

00:48:51.943 --> 00:48:53.860 align:middle line:84%
when I was contemplating
jumping into the East

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.188 align:middle line:90%
River in Manhattan.

00:48:55.188 --> 00:48:58.540 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.250 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
just started thinking

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:07.160 align:middle line:84%
about my mom who is back
home, living by herself,

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.400 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of my close friends.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering, if
they even would care,

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.790 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.190 align:middle line:90%
And then my phone rang.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:21.390 align:middle line:84%
At the very moment, I
stepped onto that rung.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:24.903 align:middle line:84%
And it was my friend Jessica
back home in Pennsylvania.

00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's ironic how
timing works in this life,

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.970 align:middle line:84%
but it couldn't have
come at a better

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
time, because she
basically talked me

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.570 align:middle line:90%
down off of that handrail.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And I went sat down on a bench.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The root problem was I
was so mineral deficient.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had such lack
of food in my system

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that I just wasn't
thinking properly.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It never really was
about the food per say.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It was more about my interaction
and relationships with people.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Good relationships were fine.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Ones that were a little
rocky just kind of like

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:90%
triggered me like that.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would basically
take everything out

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:90%
on food and fitness.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:06.960 align:middle line:84%
When I began this journey back
to normalcy, it was not easy.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It was not an easy road.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I had to accept
the fact that I was

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:90%
going to gain some weight back.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I was 145 pounds.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:90%
I was 6 foot 3.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally
zeroing in on 140.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I worked.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I would always go in
five pound increments.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And to me, those
were huge victories.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.560 align:middle line:84%

worked so efficiently for me

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to keep my eating disorder in
check is eating in windows.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I don't have to
put as much thought into food.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It kind of basically
takes my mind off of food.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:90%
So I become more relaxed.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:11.640 align:middle line:84%

this fasting myself.

The intermittent fasting,
which is essentially

00:51:36.277 --> 00:51:38.800 align:middle line:84%
intermittent feeding, which
you narrow the feeding windows.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You may restrict calories on
one or two days or more a week.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
These can be done safely
often on an outpatient basis,

but medically supervised
water only fasting

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.310 align:middle line:84%

more complicated.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:10%
in order to ensure a safe
and effective experience.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about the long-term,

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.790 align:middle line:84%
water only fasting that's done
at facilities like the True

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.290 align:middle line:84%
North Health Center
where people are

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:05.870 align:middle line:84%
able to undergo physical
exams, laboratory monitoring,

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
being in a controlled and
contained environment.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that type of a
setting, fasting can be done,

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.252 align:middle line:84%
even prolonged fasting
can be done safely.

00:52:13.252 --> 00:52:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's also important
that fasting be

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.990 align:middle line:84%
applied at patients at the
right time on the reserve

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.990 align:middle line:84%
some people that
have conditions where

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.280 align:middle line:84%
they would be better off
with a different approach

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.080 align:middle line:90%
than fasting.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.372 align:middle line:84%
Fasting may be too vigorous
or it may be inappropriate,

00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:28.570 align:middle line:84%
because of complications
with medical management

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.930 align:middle line:84%
or at least until medications
can be withdrawn, et cetera.

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So fasting has a wide
range of applications,

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:84%
but where it does
its best work is

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in dealing with conditions
that are caused by excess.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So conditions associated
with dietary excess,

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.610 align:middle line:84%
including things like
obesity, high blood pressure,

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and other cardiovascular-related
disease, type 2 diabetes,

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.200 align:middle line:84%
a host of autoimmune diseases,
and even some forms of cancer

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.170 align:middle line:84%
like lymphoma seem to
be intimately associated

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.090 align:middle line:84%
with our diet and
lifestyle choices.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes sense that
where dietary excess is

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.250 align:middle line:84%
a contributing factor
to the problem,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:84%
fasting may be a helpful
means of rapidly giving

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the body a chance to reverse the
consequences of dietary excess.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> In 1994, I had a head injury.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I regained
consciousness,

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.430 align:middle line:90%
I had a terrible headache.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And prior to the accident, I
had been a practicing dentist.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So because of the nerve
damage to my hands,

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I also had to quit
practicing dentistry.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I sought medical advice to
get rid of the headache.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I visited with
several neurologists.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.950 align:middle line:90%
They were unable to help me.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I also tried some alternative
treatments, acupuncture,

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:37.130 align:middle line:90%
cupping.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, nothing
was able to help me.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a headache every
day or 16 years, 24/7.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It just never, ever went away.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So the neurologist
told me that the reason

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I had this never-ending
headache was

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.870 align:middle line:84%
because the dura mater,
the leather-like covering

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:55.540 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and the
spinal cord had been torn

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and had become inflamed.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I saw on
the True North website

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that a number of the health
conditions that they treated

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.550 align:middle line:84%
were based on inflammation,
I decided to call and see

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:10.030 align:middle line:84%
if maybe their treatment
of water only fasting

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:11.170 align:middle line:90%
would be helpful to me.

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.628 align:middle line:84%
>> At the True
North Health Center,

00:54:12.628 --> 00:54:14.650 align:middle line:84%
we take a rather clinical
approach to fasting.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.470 align:middle line:84%
All patients are
carefully screened

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:20.710 align:middle line:84%
by both taking their
history as well as

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:23.050 align:middle line:84%
reviewing their previous
medical treatment.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> He was very honest in saying
that they had never treated

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.030 align:middle line:84%
a patient with this
particular problem,

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.980 align:middle line:84%
but he thought I
might have a chance.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.790 align:middle line:84%
When I initially
came to True North,

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:34.330 align:middle line:84%
they asked me how
long I wanted to fast.

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I had
a choice in that.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.957 align:middle line:84%
I just thought
they would tell me.

00:54:37.957 --> 00:54:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Testing protocols here at the
Truth North Health Center can

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.740 align:middle line:84%
range anywhere from
five to 40 days,

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on the patient
and how they respond.

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody or
not every condition

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.840 align:middle line:84%
has a stereotypical
amount of time

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with
its optimum outcome.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And I told him I was going to
fast until one of three things

00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:00.520 align:middle line:84%
happened, either the headache
went away or I could not fast

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.970 align:middle line:84%
any longer or all of the
doctors got together and said

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:07.108 align:middle line:84%
for my own safety I
needed to quit fasting.

00:55:07.108 --> 00:55:08.650 align:middle line:84%
People have wondered
of my commitment

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to water only
fasting, but you have

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.180 align:middle line:84%
to remember I had been in
serious pain every minute

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:90%
of the day for 16 years.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I had tried everything that
traditional Western medicine

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.900 align:middle line:90%
had to offer.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I had tried alternatives.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I also knew there was a very
good chance that I was going

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.280 align:middle line:90%
to live to be an old lady.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.290 align:middle line:90%
We have longevity in my family.

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And other than this
never-ending headache,

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't have
any health problems.

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want
to be 80 years old

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.470 align:middle line:84%
one day, thinking, what
would have happened if I'd

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:middle line:90%
gone to that True North place.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to try
everything that was

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:90%
possible to get out of pain.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So I started fasting.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The doctors come
in twice a day--

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> They're monitored twice a
day by staff doctors during

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:84%
their fasting experience,
where we're taking vitals

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.600 align:middle line:90%
and monitoring their conditions.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --to check on you to
make sure you're doing well.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And every day it was the same
question, how are you doing?

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And every day for 18 days,
it was the same answer.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any change.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I still had the headache.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But then on day 19, I woke
up and I thought, uh-oh,

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.540 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what it was,
but it was really scary,

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:90%
because something was wrong.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I'm not
moving out of this bed

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:22.645 align:middle line:90%
until I figure out what it was.

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to say it
took me about a minute

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to realize what was wrong is, I
didn't have a headache anymore.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I had forgotten what it
felt like not to be in pain.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And that lasted for
about five minutes.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I went down
to tell Dr. Goldhammer.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And if possible, I
think he might have

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:43.010 align:middle line:90%
been more excited than I was.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:44.980 align:middle line:84%
He kept saying, it's
amenable to treatment.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's amenable to treatment.

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So I went through that
whole day wondering,

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:53.140 align:middle line:84%
because the pain had only been
gone for about five minutes,

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.123 align:middle line:90%
then it came back.

00:56:54.123 --> 00:56:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, I
wondered if this

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.940 align:middle line:90%
will happen again tomorrow.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The next morning I
woke up and I had

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.070 align:middle line:90%
no pain for about 10 minutes.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And every day thereafter,
I had a little more time

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.980 align:middle line:90%
without pain.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But almost even
better than that,

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.240 align:middle line:84%
was during the
afternoon and evening,

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.880 align:middle line:90%
my pain was decreasing a lot.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.650 align:middle line:84%
When I first got
to True North, they

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:21.800 align:middle line:84%
asked me what my pain
was on the 0 to 10 scale.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And my answer was it's
about a 6 to an 8.5

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.380 align:middle line:84%
all of the time
with the exception

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of those rare moments
where it kicks up to a 10

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:84%
when I truly could
not move, when

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:90%
it would stop me in my tracks.

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And after day 19 and the pain
started to reduce over time,

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.060 align:middle line:84%
it finally got to the
point in the afternoon

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where I was down
to a one or two.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You just can't imagine
what a blessing that was.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And finally on
day 41, I woke up,

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I had had a whole
day without pain.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.350 align:middle line:90%
The doctors wanted me to quit.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was ready to quit fasting.

00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So on that day, I had
a full day without pain

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.230 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in 16 years.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Goldhammer explained
that sometimes it

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.150 align:middle line:84%
takes more than one
fast to solve a problem.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
happened with me as well.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.000 align:middle line:84%
When I started the
refeeding process, which

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is a very careful reintroduction
of food after fasting,

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I started to get some
twinges of pain on and off.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So after two months
of refeeding,

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.242 align:middle line:84%
I went back to Dr.
Goldhammer and said--

00:58:34.242 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and at the time,
I couldn't believe

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I was asking to do this
again-- but I said,

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.737 align:middle line:84%
I need to fast again,
what do you think?

00:58:39.737 --> 00:58:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he thought
that would be a good idea,

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.830 align:middle line:84%
since I had had good
results on the first fast.

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, great, I'll
start again tomorrow.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, no, you
can't start fasting right now.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.843 align:middle line:84%
You've only been
refeeding for two months.

00:58:51.843 --> 00:58:53.385 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what's the problem?

00:58:53.385 --> 00:58:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said you need to rebuild
your nutritional reserves.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.670 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
long will that take?

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, with the length
of fast that you've done,

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:05.550 align:middle line:90%
probably at least six months.

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And then six months to the day
after I ended that first fast,

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I started fasting
again, again, not

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.770 align:middle line:90%
knowing how long I would fast.

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept fasting until
all of the pain was gone,

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:19.890 align:middle line:84%
turned out it was
another 40 days.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And then I started to refeed.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
didn't have any pain,

00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:27.570 align:middle line:84%
but I had worries that
it would come back,

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.900 align:middle line:84%
but I just kept following
the doctor's recommendations

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.810 align:middle line:90%
about what to eat, how to eat.

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And it finally
dawned on me one day

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.000 align:middle line:90%
that that headache was gone.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.870 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2010.

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't had
a headache since.

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I found out about True
North through one of the talks

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Goldhammer gave
to our medical school.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing him
and thinking I definitely,

00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.170 align:middle line:84%
definitely need to do
an internship there.

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an opportunity for
doctors to train in the use

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.220 align:middle line:90%
of fasting.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.370 align:middle line:84%
We have about 30
clinicians a year

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that come from medicine,
osteopathic, chiropractic, and

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.560 align:middle line:84%
natural private colleges
as part of their rotation.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.660 align:middle line:90%
They're able to do rotations.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We're an indie residency save
for the naturopath health

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:17.620 align:middle line:90%
profession.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.523 align:middle line:84%
And those doctors come
in and spend a year.

01:00:19.523 --> 01:00:21.190 align:middle line:84%
They've recently
completed, for example,

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.170 align:middle line:84%
fasting safety
study, which shows

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that fasting can be a safe
and effective means when

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.130 align:middle line:90%
it's done properly.

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The conclusion was that water
only fasting in a medically

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
supervised facility, such
as True North Health using

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.990 align:middle line:10%
the True North Health Protocol,
because we didn't compare any

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.730 align:middle line:10%
other protocols,
is relatively safe.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:45.213 align:middle line:84%
>> We're actually very excited,
because the we see a wide range

01:00:45.213 --> 01:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
of conditions that tend to
respond to this approach.

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in a
position, finally,

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
with the help of our nonprofit
Truth Health Foundation

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
to begin to document
those results

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and present them in
a way that I think

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.005 align:middle line:84%
both clinicians and scientists
will find acceptable.

01:00:58.005 --> 01:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What the foundation is
now doing is turning that

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
into accepted peer reviewed
published research.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:06.050 align:middle line:10%
And so we're doing the
human subjects research,

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:09.550 align:middle line:10%
bringing people in to look at
how fasting changes biomarkers

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.380 align:middle line:10%
in the blood, taste and
adaptation, different studies.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So we'll actually have
published material

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%
that we can show people.

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And people will
start seeing fasting

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.730 align:middle line:84%
as a modality of healing that
really does amazing things

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:23.807 align:middle line:84%
and has been for
millennia for human.

01:01:23.807 --> 01:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, in the treatment
of high blood pressure,

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.720 align:middle line:84%
we did a study with our
colleague T Colin Campbell from

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Cornell University.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.087 align:middle line:84%
We took 174 consecutive patients
that had high blood pressure.

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And we put them through
a period of fasting,

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
followed by a whole plant food,
sugar, oil, and salt-free diet.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Of the 174 consecutive patients
with high blood pressure,

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
174 people lowered
the pressure enough

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.313 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the
need for medication.

01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And in that study, we
were able to demonstrate

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
in effect size of over 60 points
average drop in stage three

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:54.610 align:middle line:90%
hypertension.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.152 align:middle line:84%
That's the largest
effect that's ever

01:01:56.152 --> 01:01:58.030 align:middle line:84%
been shown in treating
high blood pressure

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.430 align:middle line:90%
in humans as far as I'm aware.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, if you
have high blood pressure

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and you undergo fasting and
make diet and lifestyle changes,

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
you have an exceptionally
high likelihood

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.237 align:middle line:84%
of being able to normalize
your blood pressure.

01:02:11.237 --> 01:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you're willing to do
really dangerous and radical

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.798 align:middle line:84%
things, like eat good and
exercise, go to bed on time,

01:02:16.798 --> 01:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
you have an excellent
chance of being

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.780 align:middle line:90%
able to maintain those results.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Reason I stayed after my
residency at True North is

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
because we see that on
an everyday basis here,

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be here for
years in order to understand

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.045 align:middle line:84%
the profound effect
that water fasting has.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:36.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:47.603 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone is going
too fast for a day or two,

01:02:47.603 --> 01:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
most people in the United States
are going to have absolutely no

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.070 align:middle line:90%
issues with that.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
We have plenty of fat reserves.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.743 align:middle line:90%
We can do that.

01:02:53.743 --> 01:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It is important to make
sure that people are getting

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
adequate amounts of
fluids during that,

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because dehydration
can be very dangerous.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what's happening
right now is that a lot

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
of people are improvising.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone's going to go
and say, as you mentioned,

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:09.560 align:middle line:84%
a 21-day fast, that is something
that I think should actually be

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
monitored, that
people are doing well.

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So fasting and refeeding
cycles are extremely powerful,

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
probably more powerful than
a powerful cocktail of drugs.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
eliminate the doctor,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
you eliminate the
registered dietitian,

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
you eliminate something that
is being clinically tested.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
You're now really
putting yourself

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.290 align:middle line:90%
in very dangerous position.

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that it's
not very dangerous to you

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
today, because maybe your
immune system is fine.

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking
any other drugs,

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
but maybe two years under
all, you try it again,

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
now all of a sudden
you're immunosuppressed,

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
or you have a viral
infection, or you're

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
taking a drug for diabetes,
or you're taking another drug.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And now together, they
become very problematic,

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
like the infection now could
become a little infection

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
or the insulin.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we know some
of the people that

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
have died in clinics
that do fasting

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
have died from a combination
of insulin and fasting.

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So something-- even when
I talked to dietologists,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
endocrinologist and they say,
oh, your patient could die.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, their answer is
come on, this is not possible.

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.500 align:middle line:90%
These are doctors.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
These are experienced doctors.

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize how
combining drug with fasting

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
can turn two very innocuous
things into something

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.710 align:middle line:90%
that can even be lethal.

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, metformin very
safe, very widely utilized.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, metformin happens to be
a gluconeogenesis inhibitor.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Fasting requires
gluconeogenesis.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you take a block of
gluconeogenesis and something

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that requires to survive, if
you don't have gluconeogenesis--

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and gluconeogenesis refers
to liver making new glucose--

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.575 align:middle line:84%
if you block it on one
side and you require it

01:04:58.575 --> 01:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
you can see you have

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.970 align:middle line:90%
a very problematic situation.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now think about the fact that
a hundred million Americans

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
are either diabetic
or pre-diabetic.

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:08.780 align:middle line:90%
And so all of them are eligible.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So one American in three or
so is eligible for metformin.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon we'll
be on metformin.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You see how now the
combination of fasting

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
or the improvisation
with fasting

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.220 align:middle line:90%
could be extremely dangerous.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.318 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the scariest thing
that I have ever experienced.

01:05:26.318 --> 01:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
that I was going

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to lose my life at one point.

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:37.920 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I decided to do my
35-day extended water

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
fast in a fasting clinic
outside of Canada.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I was fasting
alongside other people

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
about 30, 40 people I
think we were in total.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out actually that
there was a significant issue

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.760 align:middle line:90%
with the water.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And so even with that, even
with poor quality water,

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.080 align:middle line:84%
everybody at the center
from what I witnessed

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
did really well, in general,
up until about three weeks.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
So up until about 21 days.

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
things sort of started

01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to go down south,
not just for me,

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
but for numerous
other people as well.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.710 align:middle line:90%
By about day 26, I was really--

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
instinctively, I felt a
powerful urge to end my fast.

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:25.100 align:middle line:90%
And I ignored that urge.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.995 align:middle line:84%
And by ignoring that
urge, I got really sick.

01:06:27.995 --> 01:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
My roommate almost got raped.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy with
psychosis who slit his wrists

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and had to be rushed
to the hospital.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It turned out he had
hyponatremia trauma.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's where your sodium
levels crashed so much

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that your potassium levels
sky rocket and you actually

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
go into a mental psychosis.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
One girl was so dehydrated
she went to the hospital

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:48.860 align:middle line:90%
and had to be on IV.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And the other girl almost died.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.430 align:middle line:90%
I felt helpless.

01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:57.683 align:middle line:84%
I felt sort of desperate and
terrified, like terrified.

01:06:57.683 --> 01:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who
was there and her mother

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
came to the center
and was terrified,

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
because her daughter had
been so ill and dehydrated.

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And she had all the
symptoms of renal failure.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I felt certain that
she was going to die.

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
being up all night

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
thinking this poor
girl came here

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to save her own life
to heal and repair.

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And she literally almost died.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%


01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Her mother took
her to the hospital

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
against our fasting
supervisors directive.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And she was told that she
was in such bad renal failure

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:35.328 align:middle line:84%
and so dangerously
dehydrated that she was--

01:07:35.328 --> 01:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
they weren't sure she
was going to make it.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered
a little bit late

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is that it's very important
to research a fasting facility

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that you're in
the care of people that really

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
can medically supervise you,
make sure everything's OK.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:54.100 align:middle line:90%


01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
When things turned
for me on day 28,

01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I was really
fearful for my life.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%


01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.353 align:middle line:84%
I actually snuck in to
use a computer at a time

01:08:07.353 --> 01:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
when we weren't supposed to.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:27.189 align:middle line:90%


01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote messages to
personal people in my life,

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.310 align:middle line:84%
like telling them
that I wasn't well.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.979 align:middle line:84%
And that I was afraid that I
would lose my life and that I--

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I felt more unwell
than I had ever felt.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:45.689 align:middle line:84%
Because I fasted too long and
didn't get appropriate care,

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I think what ended
up happening was

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:51.080 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of health problems.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I had something called moon
face, extreme inflammation

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.550 align:middle line:90%
in my face.

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:middle line:10%
In my whole body, I had
edema and water retention

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.580 align:middle line:10%
from how dehydrated I had been,
how off my electrolytes were,

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.630 align:middle line:10%
weight gain.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:07.364 align:middle line:84%
I gained a lot of weight,
about 30 pounds actually,

01:09:07.364 --> 01:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
or 28 pounds in
two weeks as soon

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
as I started eating salt, even
small amounts of cooked food.

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It took me two years of eating
regularly and nurturing my body

01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:23.609 align:middle line:84%
and trying to tough out
all of these symptoms.

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:27.029 align:middle line:84%
I now two years later, I'm
finally completely feeling

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
like myself again.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.359 align:middle line:90%
I look like myself again.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.279 align:middle line:90%
Fasting needs boundaries.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I almost killed myself
through extremism

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
with my eating disorder and
all of my misuse of food.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I healed myself
through the right modalities,

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
finally brought
myself back to health

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:48.720 align:middle line:84%
with a moderate and balanced
intermittent fasting,

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
juicing, eating
healthy, developing

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
a healthy relationship to food,
and then took it a step too far

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
again, did extremism,
and almost died again

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
with my long water
fast, making myself

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
sick for an additional
two awful years,

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
only to then find balance
again to finally again go back

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to a moderate way of just
intermittent fasting,

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
getting the benefit
without extreme.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:18.034 align:middle line:90%
Fasting needs boundaries.

01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:21.422 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:10:21.422 --> 01:10:24.820 align:middle line:90%


01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:28.560 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the brilliant part of
the fasting mimicking diet is

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.390 align:middle line:10%
that at the Longevity Institute,
they did research for many,

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:37.320 align:middle line:10%
many years and discovered how to
use food to fly under the radar

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.200 align:middle line:10%
of what we call mTOR,
the detection of food.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
So you're actually eating food.

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So your body sees food, but
your brain sees fasting.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The NCI, the National Cancer
Institute gave us the funds

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.700 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And we come up with
a fasting mimicking

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
diet that is as effective as
fasting, as water only fasting.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's five days, but the
five days of eating the fasting

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
mimicking diet gives you the
same benefits as if you did

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
a complete water fast, nothing
but water for four days.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.405 align:middle line:84%
>> And we call it fasting with
food, which is a fascinating,

01:11:12.405 --> 01:11:14.690 align:middle line:90%
or fascinated concept.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And L-Nutra 2016 launched
Prolon, the very first fasting

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
mimicking diet.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And Prolon for Promoting
Health and Longevity.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I first heard about Prolon
when I asked Valter Longo, Dr.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Valter Longo, if I could
you him for my website,

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
where I write about healing
naturally from inflammatory

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:36.650 align:middle line:90%
disorders.

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.100 align:middle line:10%
I had this wonderful
conversation

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.300 align:middle line:10%
about how his fasting
mimicking diet can turnover up

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.390 align:middle line:10%
to 40% of white blood cells
in the immune system, which

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.410 align:middle line:10%
is fantastic news, because for
people with the disorder I had,

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:52.260 align:middle line:10%
which is the reason I
left CNN and the BBC.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a journalist
in war zones for about a decade,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000 align:middle line:90%
until I got really sick.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.167 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't work anymore.

01:11:58.167 --> 01:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I devoted myself to
blogging about these conditions.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.450 align:middle line:90%


01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I tried the five day fasting
mimicking diet, the Prolon.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.795 align:middle line:84%
My first round of Prolon
was pretty amazing.

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
in my life that I

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
had had complete relief from
my symptoms of mass cell

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:18.670 align:middle line:90%
activation.

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just absolute and
total remission of symptoms,

01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:27.580 align:middle line:90%
just so, so quickly.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And it lasted for about for
about a month I would say,

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:34.890 align:middle line:90%
which is--

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I have understood that I
need to do it once a month.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with a
very rare, only 10% to 20%

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
of all cases, are
this type of cancer,

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:50.100 align:middle line:84%
with a very rare and
very, very aggressive.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's called triple
negative breast cancer.

01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Coincidence, I had just
arrived in LA thankfully,

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
because I was told
that I could join

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
a medical trial for their
new fasting product, which

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.960 align:middle line:90%
is called Chemo Leave.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And they're looking at it
in cancer patients to improve

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.970 align:middle line:10%
the efficacy and
safety of chemotherapy.

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:15.880 align:middle line:10%
>> We are seeing we find that
mice and probably patients

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:20.620 align:middle line:10%
become protected against
chemotherapy and the cancer

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.180 align:middle line:10%
cells instead don't--

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.610 align:middle line:10%
when you just use
fasting cycles, usually

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.470 align:middle line:10%
at least in mice,
fasting cycles are

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.230 align:middle line:10%
as powerful as
chemotherapy, but it

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:31.420 align:middle line:10%
is the combination of
fasting and chemotherapy

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.890 align:middle line:10%
that is really effective.

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we see 20% to 60%

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of mice becoming cancer free in
response to that combination.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for many
different types of cancers.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was a number
that made me think, OK,

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to do both,
especially when I was told that

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
it would protect my
body, my immune system.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought I
really can't pass that up.

01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Amazing thing is that I have
this pre-existing inflammatory

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
condition, the mast cell
activation syndrome, which

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
means that part of my immune
system is kind of on the fritz.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's these
cells, the mast cells

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
are constantly releasing
inflammation into the body.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently,
we're really

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
susceptible to
allergy-type things.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more allergy
inducing than chemotherapy,

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
which is why they give you
steroids the day before,

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
the day of, and the day after,
and then maybe every day

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
after that, depending
on how you react.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, I went
through one cycle out of eight

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
without the Chemo
Leave, because I fasted.

01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a scheduling
mix up at the hospital.

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't able to do
my treatment that day.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.592 align:middle line:84%
So the difference
between the time

01:14:45.592 --> 01:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that I went without
it and the time

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that I went-- the times
that I did the Chemo Leave,

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself going
into shock while I

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
was receiving the chemotherapy
that time without the Chemo

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Leave.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And I firmly believe that
I was OK the other times,

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because my immune system
was being protected.

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
All the genetic
testing that I did

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
revealed was that my tumor had
certain characteristics that

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
respond to fasting,
which is amazing.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So I can actually switch off
the genes that were expressing--

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the troublesome
genes that were found

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in my tumor that were driving
the growth of the tumor

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.203 align:middle line:90%
are turned off by fasting.

01:15:29.203 --> 01:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
The reaction of most
people when you tell them

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
through chemotherapy

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.230 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely horror.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays we have
medications that

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:40.215 align:middle line:90%
can handle the side effects.

01:15:40.215 --> 01:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
are on steroids.

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They're on two or
three different kinds

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.943 align:middle line:84%
of antihistamines or medication
to stop them from throwing up.

01:15:45.943 --> 01:15:47.652 align:middle line:84%
They're on medication
to help them sleep.

01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
They're on medication--
they're on beta blockers

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to block the adrenaline, because
they're having so much anxiety.

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They're on Xanax,
stuff like that.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take most
of what I was given.

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I was kickboxing for an hour
at a time, three days a week.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
I was doing yoga.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I was standing on my head.

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
I was doing headstands.

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I was almost doing acroyoga.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I was running up to 45
minutes a day, but the cycle

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't do the fasting,
I struggled to exercise.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I maintain my weight
throughout the whole thing.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
People keep telling me
things happen for a reason.

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of what kept me
going through the whole cancer

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
thing and thinking
I need to is how

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.850 align:middle line:90%
everybody about the fasting.

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
| need to tell everybody,
because I think

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.540 align:middle line:90%
it's going to save sanity.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to save lives.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes something
is so life-changing

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can't help
but want to shout it

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
out to absolutely
everybody you meet,

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
because what you
experienced was so profound.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.890 align:middle line:90%


01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the problems with
fasting and fasting mimicking

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
diets are what you're
essentially selling is nothing.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You're selling the idea that
your body can fix itself if we

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
remove all of the stimuli.

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So monetizing that can be a
real challenge, getting people

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
to care and invest money in
something where essentially

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
the benefit is other people get
better is the ultimate goal,

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:16.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a
very good business

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:17.333 align:middle line:90%
model for the most part.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
challenges in getting people

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to care about this is,
what's in it for me?

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.897 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a little tricky.

01:17:23.897 --> 01:17:24.980 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with drugs?

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
handled by people

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.990 align:middle line:90%
that have spend a lot of time.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage anybody that is
thinking about a clinical trial

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to contact us and have our
contribution in developing

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the clinical protocol
for the trial.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently published
just a few months ago,

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:43.790 align:middle line:84%
a major paper in Cell, showing
that fasting mimicking diet

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
some five to six cycles are able
in mice models to reverse type

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
1 and type 2 diabetes.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time in history

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that the reverse of
diabetes could be done.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's due to the
stem cell rejuvenation.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
The stem cells in the body
when the body is starved,

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.400 align:middle line:84%
they actually specialize in
beta cells in the pancreas

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and allow the pancreas
to reproduce insulin

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and decrease glucose
in the blood.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Beta cells in the pancreas
are rejuvenated, regenerated.

01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There is nothing in medicine
today that can induce these

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.620 align:middle line:90%
effects.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We think it's a very old
program that is not that

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.940 align:middle line:84%
different from what happens
when you cut yourself.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So you cut yourself.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
weeks, everything

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
goes back to almost
a perfect state.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So the body really
knows how to repair

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:38.240 align:middle line:84%
itself is that probably fasting
is always being used as a way

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of bad cells,
turn on stem cells,

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
regenerate for tens
of thousands of years.

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And now in the last
100 years or so,

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:50.070 align:middle line:90%
we eat so much, all the time.

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And most patients that
we talk to have never

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
gone more than a day
or so without food.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So it turns out that once
you get to about the third day

01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of not having any food,
then your body has to go

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
into action.

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:05.245 align:middle line:84%
>> After two days, either on
a complete fast or a fasting

01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
mimicking diet, now the
body starts really entering

01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:09.650 align:middle line:90%
a starvation response mark.

01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The body then starts shedding
elderly cells and cells with

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
DNA damage, because these
are consuming calories.

01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing
their job right though.

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And then as the body starts
pushing the stem cells,

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
the young cause affected from
the carrier stem point cells,

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
pushes them to
actually replace those.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And now you have new
cells in the body

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.485 align:middle line:90%
replicating and taking action.

01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call part of
the rejuvenation in the body

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
due to the consecutive or
longer period of fasting

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
what we call today prolonged
or periodic fasting.

01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
In terms of stem cells, you
will not stimulate stem cells.

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
You won't get brain driving
neurotrophic factor increased,

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
unless you fast for at
least three to four days.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to realize that
stem cells are the repairman

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.840 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.250 align:middle line:90%
They're all over your body.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly working
to repair little bits of damage

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that happen every day.

01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But think what would
happen if those stem

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.590 align:middle line:90%
cells stopped doing their job.

01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in a lot of patients,

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
who really aren't living
a healthy lifestyle is

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.450 align:middle line:90%
those cells can get hurt.

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're not doing their job.

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.230 align:middle line:90%
So injuries stack up.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.750 align:middle line:10%
In 2004 I was reading
an animal study

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:23.630 align:middle line:10%
on a rabbit that showed that
you could take mesenchymal stem

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:25.370 align:middle line:10%
cells and regrow a disc.

01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that
caught my attention,

01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
because we had a lot of back
pain patients with bad disc.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.870 align:middle line:10%
So I sought out some
researchers that

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:37.300 align:middle line:10%
were using mesenchymal stem
cells to treat injuries.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were
doing it in horses.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we reported
that over to humans.

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:47.540 align:middle line:10%
So today, we've published
50% of all of the patients

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:50.480 align:middle line:10%
in the world literature who have
been treated with stem cells

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.250 align:middle line:10%
and who have
orthopedic problems.

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
What we can say at this
point is that the environment

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that your stem cells
are in can have

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
a dramatic impact on
their ability to grow,

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
proliferate, and do what
they're supposed to.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
That environment can
be affected by diet,

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
can be affected by exercise,
can be affected by medications.

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Every thing in the body
has multiple functions,

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
multiple sites of action.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you give a drug that
you think is working one site,

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:23.480 align:middle line:84%
it's working and doing things
all over the body in ways

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that we may not even comprehend.

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.680 align:middle line:10%
That's why when you
look at pharmaceuticals,

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.360 align:middle line:10%
the list of side
effects are huge,

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.717 align:middle line:10%
and often including death.

01:21:30.717 --> 01:21:33.050 align:middle line:10%
If you've watched television
and you see the commercials

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:35.780 align:middle line:10%
for many of the
pharmaceuticals, they actually

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.310 align:middle line:10%
show people having
a wonderful time.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:40.310 align:middle line:10%
And then they say and, by the
way, this drug may kill you.

01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:42.680 align:middle line:10%
That is one thing
that does not happen

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.770 align:middle line:10%
when you eat the right
foods, when you exercise,

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.970 align:middle line:10%
when you incorporate
periodic fasting.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>> So what we found was
that high blood pressure

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.110 align:middle line:10%
medications,
cholesterol medications,

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:56.180 align:middle line:10%
these are common things taken by
many, many different Americans,

01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:01.650 align:middle line:10%
but they hurt their stem cells
ability to grow and culture.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a good thing
if you think about the fact

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
that these medications are
impacting your body's own stem

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
cells and their ability to
maintain and repair that body.

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a big problem.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So as an example, we've
treated lots of patients

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
through the years with
tendinopathy due to taking

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
a specific type of antibiotic.

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I literally
became debilitated.

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I had shoulder pain,
neck pain, leg pain.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I could barely walk.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I even had a hard
time breathing.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Two of my discs had completely
herniated into my spine.

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:39.175 align:middle line:90%
I really felt I was dying.

01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a known
problem though.

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
They'll take this
antibiotic, because they

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.280 align:middle line:90%
have a common cold.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.657 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing they
know, they're in chronic pain

01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:46.490 align:middle line:90%
all over their body.

01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that
particular antibiotic

01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
reduces the stem cells
ability in their body

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:55.130 align:middle line:90%
to repair their tendons.

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And we all get tendon
wear and tear every day

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be repaired.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we started realizing

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when we were going to
use the patient's own cells

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to try to repair
something, we had

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to have patients clean
up their lifestyle,

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.740 align:middle line:90%
including their diet.

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We make sure that they're
fasting when they come in,

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
because we know that fasting
can increase the body's ability

01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:17.930 align:middle line:90%
to help prepare itself.

01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> For the next several weeks,
after each time I do a fasting

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
mimicking diet, I end up with
a significantly reduced pain

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.510 align:middle line:90%
in all my joints.

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Polycystic ovary syndrome,
that's one of my niches.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%
I deal a lot with hormones.

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
If you take an
unhealthy woman and you

01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
trick her body into
getting pregnant,

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.720 align:middle line:90%
often it will be rejected.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And if it's successful, it's
not usually very successful,

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.800 align:middle line:84%
because you often will have
very severe complications later

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.410 align:middle line:84%
on towards the end of
pregnancy, like high blood

01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
pressure, toxemia, preterm
labor, a lot of diabetes,

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.200 align:middle line:84%
many, many complications
in these women

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
when they do not
get them healthy,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
but trick them into
getting pregnant.

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So then she came to
me and she just said,

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I've tried the
conventional route.

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I've spent thousands of
dollars trying to get pregnant.

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I've heard that there
is this integrative approach.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.290 align:middle line:90%
So what can you do to help me?

01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:11.240 align:middle line:90%
She did everything I asked.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.280 align:middle line:90%
So she had a large breakfast.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.880 align:middle line:90%
She had a medium lunch.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.160 align:middle line:90%
She had a tiny dinner.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.170 align:middle line:90%
She didn't eat after 7:00 PM.

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
She began exercising.

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:22.250 align:middle line:90%
She ate no processed foods.

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
She did everything right.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Then after a month,
I put her on Prolon.

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
After three cycles,
she got pregnant.

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:34.220 align:middle line:90%
That was almost a year ago.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And she has recently
delivered her baby.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.340 align:middle line:10%
She is a beautiful healthy baby.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.210 align:middle line:90%
She is in her late 30s now.

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.010 align:middle line:84%
She's been trying
for all these years.

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Depending on the
therapeutic use,

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:47.580 align:middle line:84%
you have to really
understand this and use it

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.380 align:middle line:90%
to your advantage.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we do
it for metabolic syndrome,

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, and cancer, we
do between four and five

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
days of fasting together
with various therapies.

01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
That's sufficient.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
When we look at autoimmunities,
instead we go to seven days.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do that?

01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we now want
to do more destruction

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
of damaged cells, the
autoimmune cells, in this case.

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you do a
shorter fast, you're

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
not really going to benefit
that much, because you

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough time to
destroy the damaged cells.

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have
less rebuilding

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.380 align:middle line:90%
using the stem cells.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is why it's so important
to understand the mechanisms

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.950 align:middle line:84%
behind it and for each
purpose really using

01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
a different fasting-based
intervention.

01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I was working on a
documentary for the BBC,

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
"What if We Could
Stay Young Forever?"

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at diet
and exercise and lifestyle.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I met Dr. Valter Longo
to talk about his work.

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was at the
time he was preparing

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
for his clinical
trial and suggested

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
that I might like to be one of
the volunteers in that trial.

01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So the trial involved what is
known as a fasting mimicking

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:02.300 align:middle line:90%
diet over five consecutive days.

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.747 align:middle line:84%
And that was
repeated three times.

01:26:03.747 --> 01:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that our
large clinical trials have

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.663 align:middle line:84%
shown is that at the very least
we know that fasting mimicking

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
diets are safe for
the average person.

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the number one thing
that I noticed is his weight

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:14.350 align:middle line:90%
control.

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The past year I have
prescribed Prolon diet to about

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
120, 130 patients.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.500 align:middle line:10%
Out of them come to me
saying, I tried all the diets.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And I can't lose weight.

01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.677 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tell them well
let me prove you wrong.

01:26:28.677 --> 01:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's try this diet.

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:31.302 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that
you will lose weight.

01:26:31.302 --> 01:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%
All of them have lost weight.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The other things we saw
is that you do have to train

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:35.810 align:middle line:90%
the body.

01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
like working out.

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.145 align:middle line:84%
If you just do this
once for five days,

01:26:39.145 --> 01:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a lot
of the benefits,

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit of
weight loss, a number

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of other metabolic markers
may be affected as well.

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But you will eventually
return to normal

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
if you make no other
lifestyle changes

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:52.850 align:middle line:84%
over the period of the next
several weeks to months.

01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
If you do this consecutively
for three months

01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
in a row of five days at
the beginning of each month,

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.950 align:middle line:84%
we see that you maintain a
much more significant amount

01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of the benefits over a
much longer period of time.

01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I find Prolon to be a
breakthrough in the care that I

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
give to diabetics.

01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Ideally, once a quarter
is about what appears to be

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
the kind of set point to keep
that sort of cellular muscle

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
tone, as you will, to keep the
body in shape for nutrition.

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Longo actually
did a study where

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.090 align:middle line:90%
he did two groups of mice.

01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
One group they both take
the same total calories

01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:29.090 align:middle line:90%
during the study.

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:33.627 align:middle line:84%
One group had fasting mimicking
mixed in and then overate.

01:27:33.627 --> 01:27:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And the other group made the
same amount the whole time.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And the group that overate
with fasting mimicking diet

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:40.027 align:middle line:90%
was still skinny.

01:27:40.027 --> 01:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And the other group
of mice was obese.

01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So it is really about training
the cells how to use nutrition.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
You can take in even potentially
less good for you foods

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
if your body's in shape.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And it will do the
right things with them.

01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> They'll say they've lost
up to eight pounds a week.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
They have more energy,
they feel better.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been trying to convince
this patient for months

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and months, maybe a year
to try to give up his soda.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It just took five days with
Prolon for him to stop.

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.670 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the brilliance of the
fasting mimicking diet that we

01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:14.660 align:middle line:10%
get to harness our inner powers
to heal while simultaneously

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:15.740 align:middle line:10%
enjoying food.

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.850 align:middle line:10%
So what could be better?

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:22.150 align:middle line:90%


01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What we've been teaching here
since 1956 is that people ought

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
not to be eating solid food
until approximately 10:00

01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:32.020 align:middle line:90%
or so in the morning.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.580 align:middle line:90%
We wind down in the evening.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.490 align:middle line:10%
Ideally, you don't eat
after 5, but the latest

01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:39.140 align:middle line:10%
would be 6 or 7
o'clock at night,

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:42.430 align:middle line:10%
providing you go to bed
then three hours later.

01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Now this is something
we've observed

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.585 align:middle line:84%
with hundreds and
hundreds of thousands

01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:48.880 align:middle line:90%
of people for over 60 years.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer a
theory or a philosophy.

01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
community now has

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
validated what
we've been observing

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.970 align:middle line:90%
in a clinical setting.

01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So all of our guests here are
encouraged to do at least a one

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
day a week fast.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I had the privilege of
directing one of the most

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.040 align:middle line:10%
renowned fasting clinics
in Europe in Sweden.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So the government realized
they needed to do research.

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And they spend about 2 and
1/2 billion dollar to find,

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
but it was like
90% success rate.

01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And we actually got certified.

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that
to us, any physician

01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that thought, well, you have
an inflammatory problem,

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.810 align:middle line:84%
because fasting was
definitely something that

01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
worked as an anti-inflammatory
with arthritis,

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis, and
gout, and asthma, emphysema,

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
psoriasis, eczema, you
name it, everything

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
just about under the sun,
and diabetes, cardiovascular,

01:29:51.190 --> 01:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
obesity, Crohn's, colitis,
then actually 80% of their feet

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:58.670 align:middle line:90%
would be paid by the government.

01:29:58.670 --> 01:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So this was back in
the mid '70s and ran

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.170 align:middle line:90%
until beginning of '80s.

01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It disappeared when a new group
came in to the government.

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it wasn't
replaced by something

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.340 align:middle line:90%
that was even better.

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
90% success rate.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I think those people
were influenced by money,

01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:20.380 align:middle line:90%
as simple as that.

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I was driving and all
the cars were disappearing

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.500 align:middle line:90%
into an abyss into a mirror.

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And the white lanes
were going up and down.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And my head was
pounding so bad that I

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.100 align:middle line:84%
felt like someone
was taking a crowbar

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and pulling apart my head.

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I pulled over on this
side of the turnpike.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I had a four pound
brain tumor that

01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
was surgically removed at the
National Institutes of Health.

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest ordeal
that I ever went through.

01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:01.520 align:middle line:10%
They drilled six holes into
my head and 47 staple scar.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%


01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:09.810 align:middle line:10%
When I was diagnosed with
two more brain cancers,

01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:13.620 align:middle line:10%
I just fell apart.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:18.390 align:middle line:10%
I could not handle
having surgery.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.940 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't handle chemo.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Here at Hippocrates,
ever since 1956,

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
we've been dealing with tens
of thousands of people who have

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.680 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In October of 2012, I
found a lump in my breast.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It was cancer.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.260 align:middle line:84%
This cancer had grabbed a hold
of everything behind my knee

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and bundled them.

01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't do
anything, but cut my leg off

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:47.740 align:middle line:90%
above the knee.

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And the last three
oncologists that we consulted

01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
with, second or third opinions,
all said the same thing,

01:31:55.530 --> 01:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
that she has to have the leg
removed or she's going to die.

01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:00.660 align:middle line:90%
No mistake about that.

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, fasting has
always been a big part,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
a significant part of the
caloric intake and dietary part

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of our program.

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But those who condone water
fasting in the case of people

01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
who are in the conquest
of all forms of cancer,

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.720 align:middle line:84%
we don't think it's
really prudent.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.730 align:middle line:90%
You need caloric intake.

01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:22.800 align:middle line:84%
You need the protein
that literally

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:26.160 align:middle line:84%
comes from the juices
we suggest here,

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
which are non-sugary juices
made out of green vegetables,

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.200 align:middle line:84%
green leaves, and most
important sprouts that have very

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.100 align:middle line:90%
high amounts of amino acids.

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And these amino
acids are something

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that the body requires
to maintain the strength

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.680 align:middle line:90%
and the viability of the cells.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Now we're made of cells.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
You have 100 trillion cells
that make up your body.

01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And this tends to break down.

01:32:51.150 --> 01:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
The emaciation you
see from cancer

01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:57.450 align:middle line:84%
basically is a
protein degradation.

01:32:57.450 --> 01:33:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I end up doing
it for three months.

01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:05.340 align:middle line:10%
And when I went back
to the oncologists,

01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.480 align:middle line:10%
I did the MRI with contrast.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.350 align:middle line:10%
We got the results, no cancer.

01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I maintained this lifestyle
very strictly for a full year

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time continued
to see that lump diminish until

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:22.670 align:middle line:90%
now it's gone.

01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm 91, this
little girl is 90.

01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> For 21 years, I
have been cancer-free.

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.390 align:middle line:90%
We are great dancers.

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:36.462 align:middle line:84%
We now teach people at
Golden Lakes to dance

01:33:36.462 --> 01:33:37.938 align:middle line:90%
>> And we kiss.

01:33:37.938 --> 01:33:42.870 align:middle line:90%


01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I get these horrible skin
rashes on my face and my body.

01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Coming to a place
like Hippocrates

01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
would make my life and
just the fasting experience

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.000 align:middle line:90%
a lot easier.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> For me just doing water
fasting wasn't going to work.

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Even more than a day
was very difficult,

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.520 align:middle line:90%
just for me personally.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I can only speak from
personal experience,

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.510 align:middle line:84%
but if I were to do
the juice fasting,

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
it was easier, because
I was able to still

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.240 align:middle line:90%
have that intake of food.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And today is actually the
fourth day that I'm coming out.

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm easing myself
gently out of fast.

01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:18.480 align:middle line:90%
My skin just smoothing out.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the red marks
I usually have on my arms

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and in my face.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I lost 40 pounds in
90 days on a juice fast,

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:28.080 align:middle line:90%
never gained it back.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So the problems we have
today that 2/3 of Americans are

01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:38.700 align:middle line:84%
obese, 5% morbidly obese,
diabetes, cancer, arthritis.

01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
All of this should
never have happened.

01:34:41.210 --> 01:34:44.170 align:middle line:84%
We had this solution
in the '70s.

01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We really need to
realize there's

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.630 align:middle line:90%
nothing new under the sun.

01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Get back on the track
with your own lifestyle.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever religion,
whatever country

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
you come from, I think
you will agree with this,

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
we have to take our
responsibility in our own hands

01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and have the life for our
family, for our children,

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and our grandchildren
that they deserve.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.990 align:middle line:90%
They deserve an amazing life.

01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us are
looking right now at the future

01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:15.915 align:middle line:84%
and saying, how are they
going to deal with this?

01:35:15.915 --> 01:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to
deal with the diseases?

01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:19.582 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to
deal with food that's

01:35:19.582 --> 01:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
not nutritious with all the
chemicals, the pollution

01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:23.513 align:middle line:90%
in our water and our air?

01:35:23.513 --> 01:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to deal with it?

01:35:24.930 --> 01:35:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's time we deal with it.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
