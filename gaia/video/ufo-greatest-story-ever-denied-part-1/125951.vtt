00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Very brief excerpt
from the report

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Air Force's scientific
advisory board, which

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:84%
they made recently upon
completing a detailed review

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
of the subject of UFO.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.115 align:middle line:90%
This is the statement.

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
"The committee
concluded that in the 19

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
years since the first
UFO was sighted,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:84%
there has been no evidence that
unidentified flying objects are

00:00:31.840 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
a threat to our
national security."

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:10%
>>And I took a camera
that was set up

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:10%
with an 18A ultraviolet filter
on a Super 8 millimeter color

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:10%
camera.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I set the camera to
expose at two frames a second,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
so that I'd get some endurance
out of the small roll of Super

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
8 film.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I took it up in an airliner
between Long Beach and San

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Jose.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I fired it out through
the airliner window

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
with the 18A filter
over the camera.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And there were UFOs
coming and going

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:10%
to the side of the
airliner during the flight.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:10%
And on takeoff from
San Jose, one of them

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:10%
warped around the
wing of the aircraft

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:10%
and is seen at two frames
a second on this film.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I always hoped that
people would take this up,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
because I did publish it.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there just
wasn't any ambition

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
to penetrate into the invisible.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:10%
Everybody wanted ships from
other planets with men in them.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.258 align:middle line:10%
So that's where it's
laid until this day.

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:10%
>>There are three
events in UFO history

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:10%
that have made this
motion picture possible.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:10%
In the 1950s, Trevor
James Constable

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:10%
unlocks one of the
mysteries of UFOs.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:10%
With the aid of
infrared photography,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:10%
he discovers the fact that
some UFOs are invisible.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
By using infrared
film in his cameras,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
he discovered UFOs that exist in
a light spectrum that cannot be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:84%
seen with the naked eye or
photographed with conventional

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:90%
cameras.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
This opens a whole new aspect
in the documenting of UFOs.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And his discovery reveals some
UFOs may be living creatures.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:90%
He calls them critters.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:10%
In 1994, Jose
Escamilla discovers

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:10%
a phenomenon called rods, a life
form invisible to the naked eye

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:10%
that we had never seen before.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
He also develops a
technique for filming

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
these life forms that exist
in the realm of the very fast.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.615 align:middle line:84%
He calls it sky fishing, using
high speed shutter settings

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:37.415 align:middle line:90%
on camcorders.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, NASA stops
airing live broadcasts

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
from shuttle missions
after UFO footage has

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
been made public, creating a
controversy about how much NASA

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.423 align:middle line:84%
really knows about
their existence.

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:10%
>>Looks like you've got
an object right in front

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:10%
of you, Mark.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:10%
You looking out there?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:10%
>>Not sure what
you're talking about.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Never mind.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>>That same year,
Martin Stubbs begins

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:10%
recording what
will be five years

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:10%
and over 2,500 hours
of uninterrupted

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:10%
live broadcasts from
NASA's own downlink.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have digital
camcorder technology

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that enables us to capture UFOs
in full color, high resolution

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:90%
video.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Invisible UFOs can now be
captured in broad daylight

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:90%
by anyone.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Two camcorders of the
same make and model

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
are set up side by side.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:10%
What has never been
seen that exists

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:10%
in the invisible
realm of the infrared

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:10%
can now be seen using
current camcorder technology.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:10%
>>Within 15 minutes total that
we saw the first group go by.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:10%
>>It makes it all
worthwhile when

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:10%
you're out there getting
cold and a sore neck,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:10%
looking up and just thinking
that more people could do this.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:10%
>>Using this new
technology for filming

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:10%
UFOs invisible to the naked
eye, someone out there

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:10%
will eventually capture the
best UFO or rod footage ever.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.991 align:middle line:10%
UFO research, however, is
only a part of the story.

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:10%


00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it's long past time
to open this up to the public.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:10%
>>Give us information
to the young people

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.485 align:middle line:10%
of the world in this country.

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:10%
They want to hear it.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:10%
They want it.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:10%
Give it to them.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:10%
Don't hide it and tell
lies or make stories.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:10%
They're not stupid.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Eventually, there's going
to be something happen that

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:10%
will make all of them have
egg all over their face.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
have to admit that they

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.907 align:middle line:90%
haven't been truthful at all.

00:06:50.907 --> 00:08:00.007 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>The nations of the
world will have to unite,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.456 align:middle line:84%
for the next war will be
an interplanetary war.

00:08:12.456 --> 00:08:15.292 align:middle line:84%
The nations of the
earth must someday

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
make a common front
against attack

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.545 align:middle line:90%
by people from other planets.

00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Anti-aircraft guns
went into action

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
against unidentified
aircraft in the Los Angeles

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
area ordered by the

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>An command at 2:25 AM.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:10%
The unidentified object moved
slowly down the Pacific coast

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:10%
from Santa Monica
and disappeared

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:10%
south of Long Beach.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:10%
Searchlights closely followed
the object down the coast

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:10%
and kept it centered
in their glare.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:10%
Shells frequently can be
seen bursting near the object

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:10%
but none appears to hit it.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The shooting stopped
at about 3:30 AM.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Approximately 20 minutes
after the firing died down,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
the ship returned
and headed westward

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
from Long Beach
towards Santa Monica.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The guns ran into action
again, hurling round

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
after round of
shells at the object.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The second barrage appeared
to be closer to downtown Los

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Angeles, since watchers could
hear the concussion of the guns

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
more clearly, and the flash of
bursting shells was brighter.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the ship disappeared for
the second time over the ocean.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We return you now
to CBS in New York.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.283 align:middle line:84%
And that was Byron
Palmer on the West Coast.

00:09:46.283 --> 00:10:11.394 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The battle of LA was the first
time that our military actually

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%
fired upon a UFO.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The next day, the
military told the press

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
it was nothing but
a weather balloon.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Another report was that
they fired at nothing,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:90%
due to war nerves.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
The Army was not too
pleased with these reports.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
If they could not bring
down a weather balloon

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
with almost 1500 rounds
fired and direct hits, then

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:84%
what would they be able to do
firing at real enemy targets?

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
time official denial

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
was put into motion
regarding UFOs.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
This was 1942, only a few
months after Pearl Harbor.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.344 align:middle line:10%
>>Our distinguished guest for
this evening is Dr. Willie Ley.

00:10:51.344 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, now, is our own
government, our own defense

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.636 align:middle line:84%
department taking the flying
saucer report seriously?

00:10:58.636 --> 00:10:59.612 align:middle line:90%
>>They have to.

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.696 align:middle line:10%
After all, the Air
Force, which is

00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:10%
the one which is
investigating, is charged

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.917 align:middle line:10%
with the defense of our skies.

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:09.526 align:middle line:10%
So if there is anything in the
skies which they don't know

00:11:09.526 --> 00:11:11.922 align:middle line:10%
and cannot account for, it
makes them understandably.

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:10%
Uneasy.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Major Donald E. Keyhoe, a
retired Marine Corps officer,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.342 align:middle line:10%
insisted that the Air Force
knew more than it was telling.

00:11:20.342 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Being observed by some type
of device which is ahead of us,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
far ahead of us, and
is probably controlled

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
by a highly advanced,
superior civilization.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
It has reached the point where
many people in the Air Force

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.124 align:middle line:90%
have the same conclusion.

00:11:40.124 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Air
Force at one time

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
had a top secret estimate
that these planes

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:90%
were interplanetary spaceships.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Right now if you report
having seen a flying saucer,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
you open yourself up to ridicule
too, which is something which

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
is deplored by the Air Force.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>In other words,
members of our audience

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
who might, for one reason or
another, see a flying saucer,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:84%
can make the reports
to the Air Force

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and be rendering a service
and not invite ridicule.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:10%
>>Instead of being a subject
for ridicule and a big joke,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:10%
actually is a serious
matter which could

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:10%
affect the lives of all of us.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Actually, most people
who report a UFO sighting

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:10%
are patriotic citizens
who have been mystified

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:10%
by something that they've seen.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And through a patriotic
sense, report it

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.745 align:middle line:84%
to the local law
enforcement officials

00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
or to the United States
Air Force Base near them.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>The first reports were brought
in by quiet and sober citizens,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:90%
like Frank Mannor.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I looked to the north of me,
and looked like a fallen star.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was red and
coming down at about a 45.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then I watched it and
was going to see if it landed

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and maybe go down
and see what it was.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.484 align:middle line:84%
And when it got to the top
of the trees, it stopped.

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:02.663 align:middle line:84%
And a blue and a
white light come on.

00:13:02.663 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it and I
thought I was seeing things.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Frank Mannor's UFO
remained over his swamp

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:90%
for more than four hours.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:90%
His children saw it.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:90%
His in-laws saw it.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Residents of the area saw it.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And I saw it looked
to be shaped like a pie.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I could see the front of it.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.978 align:middle line:84%
I just saw the round front
and I could see the lights

00:13:20.978 --> 00:13:22.016 align:middle line:90%
on either side.

00:13:22.016 --> 00:13:25.003 align:middle line:84%
>>I just wanted to stay there
and keep my eyes glued to it.

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't leave.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>But I can't fathom it,
because it seems so unreal.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:10%
>>William Van Horn, Hillsdale's
undertaker and civil defense

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:10%
director, also spotted the UFO
and was with his Geiger counter

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:10%
the next day, checking a
mysterious perfect circle

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:10%
where the UFO had been seen.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:10%
No one photographed it.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:10%
But Sergeant Newell Schneider
of the sheriff's office

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.907 align:middle line:10%
remembered it well
enough to draw it.

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It moved very rapidly at any
speed or rather any direction

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
it wanted to go.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Why, it could change and
go to the right or the left

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
or go across ways
without hesitating a bit.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.178 align:middle line:90%
>>What do you think it was?

00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if they call it a flying
saucer, that's what it is.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:10%
>>The Air Force sent its
chief scientific consultant

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:10%
on UFOs, Professor
Jay Allen Hyneck,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:10%
to check the Michigan sightings.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hyneck agreed that the
good citizens of Michigan

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
had seen something
in the marshlands.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:10%
He thought they
had seen marsh gas.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>They as children on the
farm had many experiences

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.784 align:middle line:84%
with swamp rights, and this
was obviously the thing

00:14:25.784 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that it was and they
couldn't understand

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
why the people in Michigan got
so excited over swamp lights.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>>Dr. Hynek's belief
in marsh gases

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:10%
was not exactly welcomed by
Ann Arbor sheriff Douglas

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.956 align:middle line:10%
Harvey, who had some
interesting things to tell me.

00:14:37.956 --> 00:14:39.956 align:middle line:10%
>>Because if he's going
to say it's marsh gases,

00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:44.144 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you now, in all due
respect to Professor Hyneck,

00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:45.112 align:middle line:10%
he's all wet.

00:14:45.112 --> 00:14:48.035 align:middle line:10%
I think this is a flowered up
deal, because last night he

00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:50.272 align:middle line:10%
was in my office.

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:10%
And this is what my
statement will contain.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:10%
And at 11:00, he had no
statement whatsoever to make.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:10%
He told me he had
no idea what it was,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:10%
but he said the Pentagon
said that he had

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:10%
to make a statement tomorrow.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
what I'm going to say.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So overnight he comes
up with this theory.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Right now, if you report
having seen a flying saucer,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
you open yourself
up to ridicule.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you can look at here,
with beer bottles thrown.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.114 align:middle line:90%
Look at my windshield.

00:15:16.114 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
What would you think if somebody
was throwing beer bottles

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.238 align:middle line:84%
at your house, standing
out in the middle

00:15:20.238 --> 00:15:23.986 align:middle line:84%
of the road screaming, you
nut, you fanatic, all that.

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:90%
What would you think?

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>You open yourself
up to ridicule.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you sorry now that you
did tell people what you saw?

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, I am.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I am sorry.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's not the
truth, but it's the idea

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:90%
the reaction of the people.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
They think you're a
nut, tell you the truth.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
That's just what
they figure you are.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to take it no more.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.835 align:middle line:84%
I don't want nobody
down in here.

00:15:43.835 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I just-- leave me alone.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>You open yourself up
to ridicule too, which

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:10%
is something which is deplored
by the Air Force, deplored

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.413 align:middle line:10%
by the Air Force,
deplored by the Air Force.

00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>And if the thing lands
right there by that pump,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.905 align:middle line:90%
I'd never say a word.

00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:01.846 align:middle line:84%
And he got out and talked to
me, I wouldn't tell nobody.

00:16:01.846 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way I feel.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm bitter and disgusted
in the whole matter.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>According to the
United States Air Force,

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
in following a policy
which is set fairly

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
high in the Pentagon,
there are about 250 or 300

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.116 align:middle line:84%
extremely incompetent
airline and military pilots

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:23.916 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Airlines let them
continue to fly,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
even though they
have reported UFOs.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>The Air Force has
been accused from time

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.387 align:middle line:84%
to time of hiding
information about UFO.

00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
What do you have to say
to that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:10%
>>These charges are
absolutely untrue.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:10%
>>We have not been
hiding anything.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:10%
>>This is not an attack
on the Air Force spokesman

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:10%
or the project spokesman.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:10%
They are simply following
orders to explain away all UFO

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:10%
sightings as quickly as
possible when they become public

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:10%
and deny that UFOs really exist.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:10%
>>UFOs were fairly new.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:10%
And even though there
had been sporadic reports

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:10%
throughout the late
1800s and early 1900s,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:10%
they were simply
nothing to worry about.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
Flying saucers had been reported
and photographed worldwide.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:84%
They were not an issue
because the sightings,

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
although seen by pilots
and close to Army bases,

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
did not seem to pose
any kind of threat.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:10%
They were simply passed off
as strange lights or sightings

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:10%
of atmospheric and
weather anomalies

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:10%
by untrained civilians
who were seeing things

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:10%
that were easy to explain.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:10%
After the attack
on Pearl Harbor,

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:10%
it became apparent that our
military needed to control who

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:10%
or what flew into our airspace.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Radar was the newest
technology for detecting

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
anything in our skies
that was not acknowledged

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to be our aircraft.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The battle of LA was an
example of an unknown aircraft

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that was immune to all that
our anti-aircraft guns could

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:90%
deliver.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could bring
this one object down.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.860 align:middle line:84%
What was our
military going to do

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:90%
to control this unknown threat?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
the public found out

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
these things were real,
and there was nothing

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:90%
we could do to stop them?

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The only solution was
to deny that there

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
was any kind of
threat from something

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
we had no control over,
something we could not stop.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:10%
The solution included
an official denial

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:10%
that would last over 60 years.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force and the CIA
hired and commissioned

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the top astronomers, scientists,
and experts of those times

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to become the authorities
on the subject of UFOs.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:10%
These experts appeared on
national radio and television

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:10%
and gave the naive, gullible,
and patriotic public

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:10%
the myth about UFOs.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Astronomer Thornton Page
was on a CIA committee

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that investigated
UFO reports in 1952.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Its conclusion?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
No evidence of UFOs.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Even highly regarded
astronomer Carl Sagan

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
was placed by the Air
Force as a consultant

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
on a scientific panel to
deny the existence of UFOs.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
The official Air Force reply
was that there was no cover up,

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.029 align:middle line:84%
and there were no flying
saucers from outer space.

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I would like to close by
reading a very brief excerpt

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.736 align:middle line:84%
from the report
of the Air Force's

00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
scientific advisory board,
which they made recently

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
upon completing a detailed
review of the subject of UFO.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:90%
This is the statement.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
"The committee
concluded that in the 19

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
years since the first
UFO was sighted,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
there has been no evidence that
unidentified flying objects are

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.624 align:middle line:84%
a threat to our
national security."

00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>This was to become the
greatest story ever denied.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:31.448 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.448 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:90%
[RUMBLING]

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Like any other people
in the Los Angeles area,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
my brother and I were devastated
by the Northridge earthquake.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:10%
I was awake that morning making
final edit decisions on a film

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:10%
that we had been working
on for the past year.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Our film and video editing
studio was destroyed.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So we had to finish
cutting the film

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.694 align:middle line:90%
at one of the labs in Burbank.

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:84%
We didn't realize that
the earthquake was only

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.026 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
what would become

00:19:59.026 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the many
life-changing events

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.311 align:middle line:90%
that were about to unfold.

00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We decided to go home and
visit our family for a while

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
before coming back and
starting all over again.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.954 align:middle line:84%
We went back to Roswell, New
Mexico, which is our hometown.

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of months later, we
filmed the first broad daylight

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
footage ever taken of UFOs
over the Roswell area.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:10%
We compiled an enormous archive
of broad daylight UFO activity

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:10%
at Midway, which is
where we all grew up,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:10%
and which is located just
nine miles south of Roswell.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Midway is also the place
where the rods phenomenon

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:90%
was discovered.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a rod
coming in, and it's coming

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:90%
like this outside of the water.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And you see it hit the water.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It leaves a vapor
trail and enters.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's about three or
four of them that just zip by.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're going just as
fast as rods do in the sky.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>>The rods are just one part
of an enormous panorama of life

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:10%
that is veiled from
normal human sight.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
rods, you found

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that by using an
extremely fast shutter,

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
you could slow
down and objectify

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
something that would otherwise
elude the photographic process.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
They would be gone before
they could be put on a frame.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't mean
that they're not there.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:10%
It just means that you need
a device, an apparatus that

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:10%
will remove an optical
limitation that you have.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:10%
We don't reject the microscope,
because the microscope

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:10%
intensifies the
power of human sight.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Without it, the world of
the microbe would not exist.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But that wouldn't alter the fact
that our entire environment,

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
our entire living scenario, is
really conditioned upon what

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
happens in a domain that
we cannot see directly.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the
same thing applies--

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and this will be verified
in years to come--

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:90%
at the upper border of nature.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>>But I realized at
this point that it's

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:10%
very secret, that it was kept
secret because I asked him,

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:10%
what are you going to do with
this piece of information?

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we always
airbrush these out

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
before we sell
them to the public.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So there were pesky
little creatures

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
appearing on this photograph
they wanted to get rid of.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:10%
>>This is a fact of the
matter, we were really not sure

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:10%
after John flew whether or not
there were critters, living

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:10%
critters out there somewhere.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>Critters that were
captured by NASA

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:10%
on that mission STS-75 in 1996.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
In all my considerable
experience of the entire UFO

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
scenario, I have never
seen and never expect

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.080 align:middle line:90%
to see footage like that.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And least of all did
I expect to see it

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
on film or tape that
had been exposed

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
by the government
in a NASA mission.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The shuttle Columbia
in this mission

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was equipped with a very
sophisticated and expensive

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:90%
ultraviolet camera.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It was sensitive to
the near ultraviolet.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they were up at 300
miles above the atmosphere,

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
they launched from the
Columbia a small satellite

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
with a tether.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Not long after it was
launched, the tether broke.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>We record steadily
the whole break

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and call back of the tether.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Copy, Claude.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.447 align:middle line:84%
>>Again, this is a
view of the satellite.

00:25:24.447 --> 00:25:26.822 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if it had to break,
it did it in the right place.

00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>And you see on this
astonishing film,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:84%
you see the satellite
go drifting far astern

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:90%
of this orbiting Columbia.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
The tether, which
is 12 miles long,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
straightens out into a
long, white line which you

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
can see as plainly as could be.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Columbia and the satellite
now 77 nautical miles apart.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, while this is all going
on, a whole covey of UFOs,

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
perhaps three dozen
of them, manifest

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to this ultraviolet
camera and they

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
begin moving
around, circulating,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
looking for all the world like
something in an aquarium tank.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>The satellite again,
just moving into sunrise.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Now Houston, of course,
down on the ground,

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is getting this feed
from the Columbia.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And they ask the astronauts in
the shuttle, what can they see?

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.568 align:middle line:90%
What is that they can see?

00:26:35.568 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Just getting the image.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.842 align:middle line:84%
>>Franklin, we see a long line,
a couple of star like things

00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of things
swimming in the foreground.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
what you're seeing?

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the long
line is a tether,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's a little bit of
debris the flies with us.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>It is like a
brilliant white bar.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a neon sign,
and it's 12 miles long.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, what this does is give
you a sort of cosmic ruler

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
by which you can get
an idea and an estimate

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
of the diameter of the UFOs that
are flitting around down there.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you see them
go behind the tether,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that means that you can use
that tether like a ruler

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
to measure the diameter.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And those things that are down
there going behind the tether

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are between two and three
nautical miles in diameter.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:29:38.503 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.503 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things you
see over and over again

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
is you see UFOS materialize
into the ultraviolet

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
while you watch.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:84%
You see them come
from out of nowhere

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
they are returning

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:90%
a response to the camera.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You also see them dematerialize
while you have them

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:90%
under observation.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:10%
There is two of the
central things that

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:10%
have gone on with UFOs since
day one-- materialization

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:10%
and dematerialization.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:10%
It's going on in
this film 300 miles

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:10%
above the earth photographed
by your government,

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:10%
with your astronauts
superintending the whole thing.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>We are completely
un-zoomed, and you see

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the full extent of the tether.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.669 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Columbia to Houston,
that's a much better view,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:25.755 align:middle line:90%
a lot more contrast.

00:30:25.755 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>>It's not an infrequent
occurrence out there.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.560 align:middle line:10%
They have them quite often.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>>There were probably 1500
reported cases at that time.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:10%
>>I have over 3,000 cases now.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:10%
>>They estimated 100
yards from the left wing

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:10%
was this 100 foot disk.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:10%
>>And the strength
of the signal was

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:10%
as strong as a surface
contact on the water

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:10%
of an aircraft carrier.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:10%
This contact was huge.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>We were flying
tankers over England.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:10%
And London control asked
us to intercept a UFO.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:10%
>>So it would go from one
o'clock, seven or eight miles,

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:10%
to six, seven o'clock,
seven or eight miles inside

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:10%
of four or five seconds.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.110 align:middle line:10%
You have to be moving
pretty quickly.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:10%
>>They could rise,
just go straight up.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:10%
They could do that, just
seemed like instantaneous.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>Once they started moving, they
went straight up for a while.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:10%
And then they went zep.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:12.540 align:middle line:10%
>>And left the
atmosphere, just was gone.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:10%
They just took off into space.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:10%
>>It just-- left at high speed.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes, there have
been ET visitation.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:10%
There have been crashed craft.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:10%
There have been material
and bodies recovered.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:10%
>>I didn't want to look at it
any longer than that because I

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:10%
felt that my life
was in jeopardy.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.830 align:middle line:10%
>>So I was beaten, literally
hit in the ribs and pushed.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And I was resisting.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:10%
And I know Sergeant Bastinza
was doing the same thing.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>>He said, you are never
to speak of this again.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:10%
As far as you're concerned,
this never happened.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:10%
>>And you never saw this.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:10%
I don't exist, and the
situation never happened.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:10%
>>We are here today to disclose
the truth about a subject that

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:10%
has been ridiculed
and questioned,

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:10%
denied for at least 50 years.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The reason we are
coming forward now

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we are asking for the US
Congress and for President Bush

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
to move towards an
official inquiry

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and disclosure on this subject.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.210 align:middle line:84%
My name's Clifford Stone I was
a Sergeant First Class United

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>My name is Dwynne Arnesson.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I served 26 years as a
communication electronics

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:90%
officer in the US Air Force.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>My name is John Callahan.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm a retired FAA employee.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I was the division manager
for the accidents, evaluation,

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:90%
and Investigation division.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:10%
>>My name is Don Phillips.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.520 align:middle line:10%
I was in the United
States Air Force

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and had worked with
certain intelligence

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:10%
agencies of the United
States government.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>These are people who have
been inside the CIA, NSA, NRO,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Air Force, Navy, Marines,
Army, all divisions

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
and military community,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as corporate witnesses,
contractors to the government.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:90%

>>My name is Mark McCandlish.

00:37:23.792 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And these are
folks who have been

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:84%
involved in so-called
black budget

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.850 align:middle line:84%
or covert
unacknowledged projects.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
These unacknowledged
special access projects

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:39.300 align:middle line:84%
are taking in at least $40
to $80 billion per year.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And they are sitting
on technologies that

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.790 align:middle line:90%
can change the world forever.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:90%

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>I have had grown men weep
who are in the Pentagon,

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
who are members of Congress,
and who have said to me,

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to do?

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'm prepared to tell the
story in front of Congress.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And it is the truth.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.354 align:middle line:84%
>>And I will testify
under oath before Congress

00:38:11.354 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm
saying is the truth.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.265 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm prepared to go to Congress
to swear before Congress

00:38:15.265 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:10%
that everything I've told
you people and everything

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.010 align:middle line:10%
that is here is the truth.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>These men and women
have come forward

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:90%
and they have their credentials.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:90%
They can establish who they are.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
firsthand witnesses

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:84%
to some of the most
important events

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the human race.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm willing to testify to
the truth of all these matters

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that I've spoken about in
front of Congress under oath.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm willing to testify before
Congress that what I'm saying

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.414 align:middle line:84%
>>And I am prepared
to testify in detail

00:38:45.414 --> 00:38:47.330 align:middle line:84%
concerning these events
and their truthfulness

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:90%
before Congress.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>These statements are true.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to testify
under oath before Congress.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>That I will testify under
oath as to what I say is true.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I will do so
before Congress.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>I will testify before
Congress if necessary

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and explain exactly
what happened.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>And I will testify
before the Congress

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.480 align:middle line:84%
under oath about everything
I have said and more.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>I have personally
briefed a sitting director

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of Central Intelligence, James
Woolsey, President Clinton's

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.859 align:middle line:90%
first CIA director.

00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I have personally briefed
the head of the Defense

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency, the head
of intelligence joint staff,

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
members of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:84%
many members of
Congress, members

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of the European leadership, the
Japanese cabinet, and others.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found
is that none of them

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
are surprised that this is true.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But they are uniformly
horrified that they have not

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:90%
had access to these projects.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of people talk
about conspiracies

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:90%
over a shadow government.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to testify
before Congress

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that these black
operations do exist.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I nearly became part of it.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I saw the light,
I think, or was it?

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And I got out.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to disclose
what we know.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I am willing to
testify before Congress

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.606 align:middle line:84%
under oath or before
any other organization

00:40:21.606 --> 00:40:24.210 align:middle line:90%
that what I witnessed was true.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>This whole project,
bringing this out in the open

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:84%
will probably take
other people too.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.760 align:middle line:90%
But myself, I'm 73 years old.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a good
life and no regrets.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I've loved this country.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a
Christian all my life

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.960 align:middle line:90%
since I was about 11 years old.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe God
wants this known.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe the cosmos
wants this known.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:10%
>>I know we're not
alone in the universe.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
absence of evidence

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.080 align:middle line:90%
is not evidence of absence.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's evidence that it's been
denied to the American people.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.694 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:11.694 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I stand before you today
and my Almighty God,

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and I tell you this.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If Congress calls
me in and says,

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.700 align:middle line:84%
will you testify in
detail what you know,

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I stand here today prepared
and ready to do just that.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Governments must never
lie to the people.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Headline edition,
July 8, 1947.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The Army Air Forces
has announced

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that a flying disk
has been found

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and is now in the
possession of the Army.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.671 align:middle line:10%
Army officers say the missile,
found sometime last week,

00:41:53.671 --> 00:41:56.126 align:middle line:10%
has been inspected at
Roswell, New Mexico,

00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and sent to Wright Field,
Ohio, for further inspection.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>>The whole project was, get as
much information and technology

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:10%
out of these crafts
as fast as they could

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:12.470 align:middle line:10%
and to steer the news media
off on some crazy idea

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.000 align:middle line:10%
that these sightings
were created

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:10%
by college pranks and balloons
and meteorological problems.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
information was siphoned off

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
by the CIA and the
National Security Agency

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and people at ONI, Office
of Naval Intelligence.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>It was the first time I'd ever
seen anything like this before,

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and all eyes were just peeled
on that particular thing.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And when he told us what
it was, it was frightening.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It was eerie.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:10%
You could have heard a
pin drop in the room when

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.310 align:middle line:10%
it was first mentioned.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:10%
He said it had been taken
from one of the craft

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:10%
that had crashed in
New Mexico and that it

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:10%
had been taken from
a box of materials

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.110 align:middle line:10%
that the military
was working on.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:10%
They didn't use the word
"reverse engineering"

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:10%
at that time, but
it was something

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:10%
similar to reverse
engineering they

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:10%
felt like they
needed to work on,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:10%
and it was going to
take years to do this.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>>I was a duty
officer that night.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.720 align:middle line:10%
And I went to the
veterinarian section,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:10%
and the one sergeant
I knew very well

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.376 align:middle line:10%
was sergeant of the
guard that night.

00:43:30.376 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:10%
I told him, Sarge, how is
everything around here?

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And he said, fine, sir.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I told him, you
know, they told me

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to be careful to watch
this area because you

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.300 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of
something sensitive here.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, you want
to see it, sir?

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.044 align:middle line:90%
Told him yeah, let's go look.

00:43:45.044 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the
sergeant very well.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:90%
He was a master sergeant.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I went back, and there was five
crates there, like five or six.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:10%
I think it was five.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:10%
I lifted one up and here's this
body there, floating in fluid.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:10%
First I thought it was a
child because it was small.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Then I looked at
this head and all.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.680 align:middle line:10%
This only happened in
a matter of seconds.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:10%
Then I put the end back down.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:10%
And the head was different.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:10%
The arms are spindly.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.630 align:middle line:10%
The body, it was gray.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:10%
So right at that
moment, I figured,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what this thing is.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So like in the
intelligence business,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I just better put it in the
back my head here and wait.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in the future,
I get corroboration

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.430 align:middle line:90%
so I can evaluate what it is.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Curtis LeMay started
to open up and talk

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:38.270 align:middle line:84%
about what he told me about
Roswell and the crash that

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:90%
had occurred.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that he
was aware that it is good

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.670 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't ours.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the military's,
the Air Force or the Army

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.510 align:middle line:90%
or the Navy.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was highly strange, was
a highly strange vehicle that

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:90%
crashed.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.451 align:middle line:84%
>>He said, I'm going
to tell you something.

00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:57.457 align:middle line:10%
He said, but if you
say that I told you,

00:44:57.457 --> 00:44:59.290 align:middle line:10%
I'll swear I never even
mentioned it to you.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:10%
And I said, no problem.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.710 align:middle line:10%
And he said to me, you know,
I'm a member of General Douglas

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.870 align:middle line:10%
MacArthur's security guard.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.920 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm on my way
to the States for TD1.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
tell you something.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.650 align:middle line:84%
General Douglas MacArthur
was very familiar

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:84%
with the Roswell incident,
the crash material, and also

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the bodies, because he
himself had seen him.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>There I started getting
the Tosser reports.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I started getting other crash
reports, the artifacts I got.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I did get one time
a report to the NSA

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:34.190 align:middle line:84%
was getting signals from
space, which were not

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:middle line:84%
just space noise or unscrambled
or something you couldn't read.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They were really very perfect
and looked like something

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:90%
was guiding them.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:90%
There was a real message.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We were never able to decode it.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:84%
This was a very
coordinated message.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't space noise
or just noise coming.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.862 align:middle line:90%
It was a pattern.

00:45:56.862 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:10%
>>The one person
I happened to meet

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:10%
and took quite a shine to and
he to me was a Dr. Adolph Raum.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.730 align:middle line:10%
Just for a little
background on him,

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.910 align:middle line:10%
he was from
Switzerland originally.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:84%
He was on their first
A-bomb test in the US.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.130 align:middle line:84%
He knew Dr. Oppenheimer
personally, and just

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.580 align:middle line:90%
a fine, fine gentleman.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:84%
One night after supper
and after a few martinis,

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I jokingly asked Adolph.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you know
about the little gray men that

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly on ice
here at Wright Patterson?

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And I can distinctly recall
his face turning ashen white.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.810 align:middle line:90%
His voice got very stern.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Arnie,
he says, all I

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:84%
can tell you is that they
were not weather balloons

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and we will not
talk about it again.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
uncertainty in my mind

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't talk
about this further.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>We can safely say that, yes,
there were some captured craft

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:90%
in Roswell, New Mexico.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, they were real.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we really did get
some technology from them.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And yes we really
did put it to work.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>How many bodies
have been recovered?

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
How many crashes have occurred
in which we only got debris

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
from because they came and
did their recovery before we

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.420 align:middle line:90%
got there?

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but
it has happened.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It has happened.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.470 align:middle line:84%
When they have problems just
like we send out a distress

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.107 align:middle line:84%
call, they send out
a distress call,

00:47:23.107 --> 00:47:25.190 align:middle line:84%
which is something a lot
of people don't allude to

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or don't even-- it's the one
question that's never asked.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But here again, we think of
them as something intangible,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:90%
like that stuffed animal there.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But they're living, breathing
creatures, as mortal as you

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and I. They think.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:90%
They have loves.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.620 align:middle line:90%
They have likes.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They have dislikes.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:90%
They have social culture.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:52.280 align:middle line:84%
This is so, so important to
try to make people understand

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.070 align:middle line:90%
that that is the case.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>There were more
crashes than Roswell.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.186 align:middle line:84%
What people don't understand
is that there was one in 1948

00:48:00.186 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and there was
another one in 1949.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The radar testing in New Mexico
was the cause of a lot of them

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.830 align:middle line:90%
that were crashing.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And high powered
transmitters, when

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.884 align:middle line:84%
they would get too
close to transmitters,

00:48:16.884 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:84%
it would interfere with
their guidance control

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.883 align:middle line:90%
and they would just crash.

00:48:19.883 --> 00:48:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In other craft that crashed,
we had shot them down.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:10%
>>As an example of
some of our precision,

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.960 align:middle line:10%
we have here a photo of
an object re-entering

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:10%
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:10%
Through our programs,
we were able to predict

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.950 align:middle line:10%
the precise time that
this was going to happen

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:43.270 align:middle line:10%
and notified a particular agency
who then went out with a camera

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.900 align:middle line:10%
and was able to obtain
this photograph.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>What altitude?

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>This is just entering
the Earth's atmosphere,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:54.460 align:middle line:90%
somewhere around 400,000 feet.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.520 align:middle line:10%
>>We've been successful.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.610 align:middle line:10%
We crashed in White
Sands, New Mexico.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.480 align:middle line:10%
We tracked it.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.100 align:middle line:10%
We were tracking it
at the time, and we

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.495 align:middle line:10%
were successful in
[INAUDIBLE] where it crashed.

00:49:07.495 --> 00:49:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:90%
[CRASH]

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>I can verify, corroborated by
people that I have worked with

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.402 align:middle line:90%
and do work with now.

00:49:33.402 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>He made a comment
that was really funny

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.151 align:middle line:90%
at that particular point.

00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really connect it
with anything until later.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:44.590 align:middle line:84%
He says, you have no idea at
all what we're about, do you?

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And I told him, no sir, I don't.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.740 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, someday,
that technology

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
will be out there that has
been totally back engineered.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Went right over my head
at that particular point.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>When we gave
information out, we

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
gave it out and insisted
they take the patents.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But also, we put a little
bit of a requirement

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.720 align:middle line:90%
on the requirement.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Feed it back to us for the
competitive edge of the Army.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Take the patents.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.284 align:middle line:84%
Make all the money you want, but
give it to the American people

00:50:14.284 --> 00:50:15.640 align:middle line:90%
and give it to the world.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.247 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese, they
interviewed me.

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, when we put
the integrated circuit out,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.790 align:middle line:90%
we also gave it to you.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.500 align:middle line:10%
>>He also had fiber
optics laying there.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.770 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know what
these things were.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.744 align:middle line:10%
They figured they were
wires of some sort

00:50:27.744 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:10%
but didn't know
how they operated.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:10%
The interesting
thing that shows you

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.720 align:middle line:10%
that we have not achieved the
point of where these fiber

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.264 align:middle line:10%
optics are is my dad would
also hold them in his hand

00:50:37.264 --> 00:50:38.930 align:middle line:10%
and when he closed
his hand around them,

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:10%
the ends would be glowing.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.020 align:middle line:10%
So this means they
contained their own energy.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, why would you
need a fiberoptic system

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.960 align:middle line:90%
in a spaceship?

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, OK, if suddenly
everything in the vehicle

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.930 align:middle line:10%
suddenly becomes mass canceled,
and even the electrons

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.399 align:middle line:10%
become mass canceled,
it means that all

00:50:58.399 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:10%
of the telemetry that's
going through your system

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.570 align:middle line:10%
is going to go out of haywire.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.153 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be like suddenly
the system goes through a phase

00:51:04.153 --> 00:51:05.880 align:middle line:10%
change and everything's
superconducting.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:10%
Why use fiberoptics?

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:10%
Because photons have
no mass, supposedly.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:90%
So they're unaffected.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So it means that any
information, any telemetry

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that you send back and
forth to your computer.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if the
computer functions

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.890 align:middle line:84%
at the superconducting
level, because it just

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:22.360 align:middle line:84%
makes it faster, more
efficient, smarter.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.020 align:middle line:10%
But you want to be able to
control the aircraft so it

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.162 align:middle line:10%
doesn't crash.

00:51:26.162 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:10%
What's the best way to do it?

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.520 align:middle line:10%
With fiberoptics.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:10%
>>A second innovation
involves the delicate task

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:10%
of monitoring composite surfaces
against pressure, stress,

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:10%
strain, and chemical
decomposition.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:84%
This is often achieved
through a series

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.550 align:middle line:84%
of vibrating sensors
located along lengths

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of fiberoptics,
which are embedded

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.350 align:middle line:90%
into composite materials.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:49.080 align:middle line:84%
However, NASA has increased the
sensing locations exponentially

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.160 align:middle line:84%
from what is
currently available.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Applications for the macrofiber
composite are almost limitless.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:10%
>>They had a big black curtain
that divided the hangar

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:10%
into two different areas.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And behind these curtains
was another big area.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.650 align:middle line:10%
And inside this area, they
had all the lights turned off.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And they go in,
they turn lights on.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Here are three flying
saucers floating off

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the floor, no cable suspended
from the ceiling holding them

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:84%
up, no landing gear
underneath, just floating,

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:27.930 align:middle line:90%
hovering above the floor.

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Deann Davis with United
Press International.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Could you please
address the vehicle

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
drawing displayed of.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Why would this vehicle be
on display at an air show?

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>>There was one facility
at Norton Air Force

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:10%
Base that was close hold.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Not even the wing
commander there

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.540 align:middle line:90%
could know what was going on.

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>He said there
were three vehicles.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.702 align:middle line:84%
The first one, the smallest one,
the one most partially taken

00:52:50.702 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:84%
apart, the one that was
shown in the video that

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was running in this hangar,
November 12th, 1988 at Norton

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Air Force Base,
was about 24 feet

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.620 align:middle line:84%
in diameter, its
widest part right

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.140 align:middle line:90%
at the base of that flange.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>And during that time
period throughout my career,

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:84%
it was always
rumored by the pilots

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that that was a
cover for in fact,

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.190 align:middle line:90%
location of one UFO craft.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>And they had little
exhibits and a TV,

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.240 align:middle line:84%
a little videotape
running showing

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.280 align:middle line:84%
the smallest of the three
vehicles sitting out

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.430 align:middle line:84%
in the desert, presumably
over a dry lake bed

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:90%
someplace like Area 51.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And it showed this
vehicle making

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.980 align:middle line:84%
three little quick
hopping motions like that

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and then accelerating
straight up and out of sight

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.120 align:middle line:84%
until you couldn't
see it, completely

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.730 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from view in
just a couple of seconds.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, there were craft there.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.955 align:middle line:84%
I talked to others
that have worked on it.

00:53:42.955 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:90%
There's different levels there.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>And the reason
for that location

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.220 align:middle line:84%
was folks that could
come out, land at Norton,

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.410 align:middle line:84%
play golf, be part of a
golf tournament, so forth,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and during that process
could go by the facility

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and actually see the UFO.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.682 align:middle line:84%
>>So obviously,
this is a vehicle

00:54:00.682 --> 00:54:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that not only is
capable of flying around

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:03.931 align:middle line:84%
through the atmosphere,
but it's also

00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:07.010 align:middle line:84%
capable of going out to
space and collecting samples.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's using a type
of propulsion system

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't make any noise.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.280 align:middle line:84%
As far as you can see,
it had no moving parts.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have any exhaust
gases or fuel to be expended.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It was just there, hovering.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.630 align:middle line:10%
>>In a few instances, I
can say there are clearly

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.410 align:middle line:10%
overunity electromagnetic
devices, things

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.920 align:middle line:10%
that produce more electrical
energy out than in.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>This is an alien
reproduction vehicle.

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And just to be clear,
this means that it

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is based on advanced antigravity
and zero point energy

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:90%
propulsion systems.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>The next biggest one was 60
feet in diameter at the base.

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>There are corporations such
as SAIC, Lockheed Martin,

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Northrop, and others that deal
specifically with this issue,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:84%
with advanced energy
and propulsion

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%
systems connected to UFOs.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.600 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
what has happened,

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.280 align:middle line:10%
from the best we can tell, from
insiders that have briefed me

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.580 align:middle line:10%
for now about eight years,
is that we have lost control

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.690 align:middle line:10%
of these projects from a
constitutional law perspective,

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:07.510 align:middle line:10%
because the infrastructure
within military intelligence

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:10.940 align:middle line:10%
and corporate channels
is so well-funded and so

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.900 align:middle line:10%
complex and
labyrinthine that there

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.560 align:middle line:10%
are compartments
within compartments

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.850 align:middle line:10%
within compartments.

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And people who are in the
Congress who make inquiries,

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, President Clinton,
when he made inquiries,

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:23.380 align:middle line:84%
were simply denied access,
as you heard earlier

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that President Carter
was denied access.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, by the way, the
largest of three vehicles

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.660 align:middle line:84%
was about 120 to 130
feet in diameter.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:84%
That's massive when
you think about it.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just huge.

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason it's called
alien reproduction vehicle

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it's based on the study
of extraterrestrial vehicles,

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:43.030 align:middle line:84%
but it is manufactured by
human military intelligence,

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.140 align:middle line:84%
aerospace contracting
arrangements.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>We are not in
Kansas any longer.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:56:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Brad said that in this
exhibit, at Norton Air Force,

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:31.950 align:middle line:84%
a three star general said
that these vehicles were

00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:35.370 align:middle line:84%
capable of doing
light speed or better.

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>I think they made
a mistake at Roswell.

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.855 align:middle line:84%
Rather than admitting
it, they covered it.

00:56:43.855 --> 00:56:51.615 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.615 --> 00:56:54.095 align:middle line:10%
>>Gemini Seven, Houston,
how do you read?

00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>>Loud and clear,
Seven-- go ahead.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.404 align:middle line:10%
>>Get Bogey at 10:00 high.

00:56:59.404 --> 00:57:00.356 align:middle line:10%
>>This is Houston.

00:57:00.356 --> 00:57:01.790 align:middle line:10%
Say again, Seven?

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:05.115 align:middle line:10%
>>I said we have a
bogey at 10:00 high.

00:57:05.115 --> 00:57:07.204 align:middle line:10%
>>Roger.

00:57:07.204 --> 00:57:08.370 align:middle line:10%
>>Gemini Control here again.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:13.964 align:middle line:10%
Got the reference in that
conversation was a bogey.

00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:19.655 align:middle line:10%
It was Borman who reported
sighting the Bogey.

00:57:19.655 --> 00:57:22.690 align:middle line:10%
This is Gemini Control
at Houston at four hours

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.190 align:middle line:10%
24 minutes into the flight.

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Our moon is an object that
exists in our immediate space.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.340 align:middle line:84%
For years, there have
been anomalies recorded

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.610 align:middle line:84%
such as mysterious lights,
flashes, and objects

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that have been seen by
astronomers here on Earth.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:14.370 align:middle line:84%
NASA released a compilation
of these recorded reports

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.090 align:middle line:90%
prior to the first moon mission.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.610 align:middle line:10%
In 1962, Carl Sagan
spoke on the possibility

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.270 align:middle line:10%
of discovering alien
artifacts on the moon,

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:29.550 align:middle line:10%
stating that forthcoming
photographic reconnaissance

00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:33.245 align:middle line:10%
of the moon from space vehicles,
particularly the far side,

00:58:33.245 --> 00:58:34.870 align:middle line:10%
might bear these
possibilities in mind.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.650 align:middle line:10%
Rectangular patterns
on air space photos

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.950 align:middle line:10%
are recognized as
signs of human culture

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:50.470 align:middle line:10%
in the remote sensing of the
Earth and air archaeology.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It seems reasonable
then to search

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:57.820 align:middle line:84%
for rectangular patterns
on the moon or on Mars.

00:58:57.820 --> 01:00:33.280 align:middle line:90%


01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.960 align:middle line:10%
>>I walked into the photo
lab in the restricted area,

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:10%
and this was between missions.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.060 align:middle line:10%
One of the gentlemen I
had been friends with,

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.600 align:middle line:10%
and I still talk
to occasionally,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.400 align:middle line:10%
he pointed to one
area of this mosaic.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.070 align:middle line:90%
It was one panel of a mosaic.

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and in
one of the photo panels,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I saw a round, white dot.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, it was very
crisp, very sharp lines on it.

01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him, what is that?

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that a dot on the emulsion?

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he's grinning, and
he says, dots on the emulsion

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
don't leave round
shadows on the ground.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was a round
shadow at the right angle,

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
at the correct angle, the
sun shining on the trees.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I saw pine trees.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.840 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see a coastline.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where this was.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And I said, is this a UFO?

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's smiling at me and he
says, I can't tell you that.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you that.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
What I knew he meant was, it
was, but he couldn't tell me.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what are you going
to do with this information?

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we always
have to airbrush them out

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
before we sell
them to the public.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1965, they had
problems with a piece

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
of electronic equipment that was
bottlenecking their production

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.540 align:middle line:90%
of photographs.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into the laboratory
where the equipment was

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.430 align:middle line:90%
malfunctioning.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
An airman second class was
in the darkroom at that time.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.840 align:middle line:84%
About 30 minutes
into the process,

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
he said to me, in a very
distressed away, by the way,

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.536 align:middle line:84%
we've discovered a base on
the back side of the room.

01:02:10.536 --> 01:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he proceeded
to put photographs down

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And clearly in these
photographs were

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
structures, mushroom-shaped
buildings, spherical buildings,

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.058 align:middle line:90%
and towers.

01:02:21.058 --> 01:02:25.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:25.540 --> 01:05:13.390 align:middle line:90%


01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1959, the US
Army completed a plan

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
for a manned military
outpost on the moon.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
The Horizon Lunar
Outpost was said

01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to be necessary to
protect United States

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
interests on the moon,
to conduct moon base

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
surveillance of the
Earth and space,

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to act as a
communications relay,

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and to serve as a base for
exploration of the moon.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The permanent outpost
would cost $6 billion

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and become operational in
December 1966 with 12 soldiers.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:47.040 align:middle line:10%
The base would be defended
against a Russian overland

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.950 align:middle line:10%
attack by manned fired weapons.

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The Apollo program
began only two years

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
after the Horizon Report.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But a moon base would not
have been established earlier

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.170 align:middle line:90%
than the 1970s.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>During the discussion of
UFOs, the question ultimately is

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
going to come up,
can any government

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
keep secrets, let alone
the US government?

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is unequivocally yes.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>>People in high
level government

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:19.170 align:middle line:10%
have very, very little, if any
information, valid information,

01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:20.180 align:middle line:10%
about this.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.090 align:middle line:10%
Most have no more knowledge
than the man in the street.

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>There's always been what
they call the need to know.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>They keep pretty much each
organization an island unto

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.120 align:middle line:90%
itself.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>I looked at him, and
I was pretty startled

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.770 align:middle line:84%
because I'd worked out
there several years

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and never seen anything
like this, never heard

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.400 align:middle line:90%
of anything like this.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.600 align:middle line:10%
>>I had a top secret
crypto clearance.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And I could go into areas where
my commanders, some commanders

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:53.200 align:middle line:10%
could not even get in.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.870 align:middle line:10%
>>He was a civilian, but
had done a lot of work

01:06:56.870 --> 01:07:01.330 align:middle line:10%
with NASA, on a lot of
committees and what have you.

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:04.220 align:middle line:10%
And I think his problem
was the fact that he

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.680 align:middle line:10%
hadn't heard about this.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>They can't get in
there because they

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.635 align:middle line:84%
don't have the need to
know, even though they

01:07:08.635 --> 01:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
had the same clearance as the
guy that gets to go in there.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>He knew that he was very
important because he was

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:17.370 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of committees in NASA.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And since he was very
important, but hadn't

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
heard about this thing,
this couldn't be true.

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>The UFO secrets
can be kept secret

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
from other people who have
the same security clearance.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And then he said a
very curious thing.

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:35.977 align:middle line:84%
"I wouldn't believe it
even if it was real."

01:07:35.977 --> 01:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a direct quote
from his email to me.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
"I would not believe this
even if it was real."

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And the truth is,
they have hidden

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
things like UFO and
extraterrestrial information

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
from us for years, not
just the current era,

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
but back before the 1900s.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>There's about 38
levels above top secret.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.000 align:middle line:90%
The highest is cosmic.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.760 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:09.350 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you right now,
that's UFOs, aliens,

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:12.280 align:middle line:10%
and particalization.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, like you heard
a while ago, there's

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
only probably about 25 people
in the world that know things

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that are known at that level.

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:25.779 align:middle line:84%
No president has had
that level, has ever

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:29.090 align:middle line:90%
been cleared for that level.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower was the closest.

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:36.189 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower wanted
somebody to be in charge.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:43.870 align:middle line:10%
He tried the CIA director
and it didn't work.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.779 align:middle line:10%
The CIA was working
primarily for itself.

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:50.779 align:middle line:10%
Most of the intelligence
director of the service

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:52.420 align:middle line:10%
is working for themselves.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>What happened was
Eisenhower got sold out.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that he realized that
all of a sudden, this matter

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
is going into the
control of corporations.

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
He realized that he
was losing control.

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.740 align:middle line:10%
He realized that this
phenomenon of whatever it

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.979 align:middle line:10%
was that we were
faced with was not

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:20.560 align:middle line:10%
going to be in the best hands.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.779 align:middle line:10%
As far as I can remember,
that was the expression

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:25.069 align:middle line:10%
that was used.

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
in the best hands.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>>He had our best
interests in mind,

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and was a very loving person.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.234 align:middle line:10%
And what I love about
this family too,

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:35.109 align:middle line:10%
is we're very humble.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:37.850 align:middle line:10%
He grew up on a farm,
felt this calling.

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.779 align:middle line:84%
His family didn't
necessarily agree with him,

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:43.689 align:middle line:84%
and just rose into the
position he was in,

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
became a five star general.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.479 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really a part of
the fabric of the global elite.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
He was fighting against
that false power structure.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>In the councils
of government, we

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.890 align:middle line:10%
must guard against
the acquisition

01:09:56.890 --> 01:10:00.560 align:middle line:10%
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.220 align:middle line:10%
by the military
industrial complex.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.540 align:middle line:10%
The potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.850 align:middle line:10%
exists and will persist.

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:13.270 align:middle line:10%
We must never let the
weight of this combination

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:17.010 align:middle line:10%
this endanger our liberties
our democratic processes.

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:19.760 align:middle line:10%
We should take
nothing for granted.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.980 align:middle line:10%
Only an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.090 align:middle line:10%
can compel the proper meshing
of the huge industrial and

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.790 align:middle line:10%
military machinery of defense
with our peaceful methods

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:31.770 align:middle line:10%
and goals.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And so it was organized
under the name the NRO.

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't mention NRO.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NRO, National
Reconnaissance Office,

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.336 align:middle line:90%
basically run by the Air Force.

01:10:47.336 --> 01:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The Reconnaissance Office,
from my understanding

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of people that have had
contacts with since I retired,

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
has taken on a lot more
responsibility, particularly

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
towards UFO and
extraterrestrial activities.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
You could say that they picked
up where Blue Book dropped off.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're on
that level, there's

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
an organization
worldwide called ACIO.

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
That's Alien Contact
Intelligence Organization.

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
If you pay your dues and
you follow the rules,

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%
you can benefit.

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Your government is
allowed to benefit

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.310 align:middle line:84%
from that organization's
information.

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Henry Kissinger headed
some sort of a study group

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
back in the '50s to
study the ramifications

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of this information
if it had leaked

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.410 align:middle line:90%
through a credible source.

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jimmy Carter was
not brought into the loop.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, the
group, the control group,

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
they don't trust the
guy for some reason.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't trust Jimmy Carter.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid that he would
come out and make statements,

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
blanketed statements
to the news media.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.570 align:middle line:10%
>>I was contacted by
Miss Marcia Smith,

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.230 align:middle line:10%
who was the director of the
Science and Technology Division

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:10.090 align:middle line:10%
of the Congressional
Research Service.

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
She asked to meet with me.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And I met with her,
and she informed me

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.010 align:middle line:10%
that President Carter,
upon taking office

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:22.820 align:middle line:10%
in January of 1977, held a
meeting with then the director

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.250 align:middle line:10%
of Central Intelligence,
who was George Bush Sr.

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:30.560 align:middle line:10%
and demanded that the director
of Central Intelligence

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.770 align:middle line:10%
turn over to the president
the classified information

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.661 align:middle line:10%
about unidentified flying
objects and the information

01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:39.160 align:middle line:10%
that was in the possession of
the United States intelligence

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.730 align:middle line:10%
community concerning
the existence

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.460 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial
intelligence.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.830 align:middle line:10%
This information was refused
to the President of the United

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:50.070 align:middle line:10%
States by the director of
Central Intelligence, George

01:12:50.070 --> 01:13:04.120 align:middle line:10%
Bush, Sr.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.790 align:middle line:10%
>>He told us we could not talk
about this to anyone, including

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:16.300 align:middle line:10%
any of the other crews or
our spouses, our family, even

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.320 align:middle line:10%
amongst each other.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So we could not
discuss this at all.

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:23.090 align:middle line:10%
>>In the military,
they do ridicule you,

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:26.070 align:middle line:10%
because I was
ridiculed a few times.

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:29.790 align:middle line:10%
I was told I would never
make master sergeant.

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:31.587 align:middle line:84%
I was on orders
for tech, but I was

01:13:31.587 --> 01:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
told I would never make
master sergeant if I

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.800 align:middle line:90%
brought this trap up again.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.910 align:middle line:10%
>>The pilots that had seen
things had talked about it.

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Some of them were let go.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.920 align:middle line:10%
Some of them were
released from their flying

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.810 align:middle line:10%
and treated as nut cases
and things like that.

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:50.590 align:middle line:10%
>>At times I used to
carry nuclear weapons.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:57.080 align:middle line:10%
In other words, I was mentally
fit to carry nuclear weapons,

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:00.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not mentally
fit if I see a UFO.

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, this criticism and
this ridicule has, I think,

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
done more to keep
the story coming out

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.400 align:middle line:90%
than almost anything else.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>>It had been discussed with me
on numerous occasions, talked

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.170 align:middle line:10%
about what could
happen to me militarily

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and what could happen to
me even if I discussed this

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.210 align:middle line:10%
as a civilian.

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:25.450 align:middle line:10%
>>That subject just was dropped.

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:28.780 align:middle line:10%
It just wasn't discussed.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>>Anything to discredit you,
and you'd never get a promotion.

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:34.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'd would spend the
next three and 1/2 years up

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:39.190 align:middle line:10%
to the North Pole, flipping in a
tent checking weather balloons.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.460 align:middle line:10%
>>I've made no money from this.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.500 align:middle line:10%
I've got nothing but
pain and suffering

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.150 align:middle line:10%
out it, out of talking about it.

01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:49.140 align:middle line:10%
I've been harassed at my home.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
This was used against me
partially in losing a job once,

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
in teaching.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I've had a hell of a time
after I've told this story.

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But I continue to
tell this story

01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:59.158 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
important for people

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this sort of
shit goes on in the government.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.330 align:middle line:10%
>>He was sorry he
wrote the book.

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:10.250 align:middle line:10%
He was sorry he exposed
the family to the ridicule,

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.740 align:middle line:10%
to the lawsuits.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's been very tough
on our entire family.

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
He did not want to die leaving
us with these problems.

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Just hope that the future
people such as yourself and me

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
will know what to do with
this type of knowledge

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:27.700 align:middle line:90%
that this man brought forward.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I do say that he is the
first man to come forward

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:31.495 align:middle line:90%
in a high capacity.

01:15:31.495 --> 01:15:53.610 align:middle line:90%


01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>>Measures have been
taken by agencies

01:15:56.810 --> 01:16:01.400 align:middle line:10%
to terminate people
who appear to be

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.560 align:middle line:10%
inconvenient or troublesome
through knowing too much.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.380 align:middle line:10%
>>I would go
interview people that

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:11.780 align:middle line:10%
claimed they had seen something
and try to convince them

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:15.730 align:middle line:10%
that they hadn't seen
something or they were

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:17.590 align:middle line:10%
hallucinating or something.

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:20.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, if that didn't
work, another team

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:24.840 align:middle line:10%
would come in, give
all the threats,

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.840 align:middle line:10%
and threaten them, their
family, so on and so forth.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.440 align:middle line:10%
And they would be in
charge of discrediting

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.440 align:middle line:10%
them, making them look
foolish or so on and so forth.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that didn't
work, then there

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
was another team that put
an end to that problem one

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
way or the other.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%


01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.150 align:middle line:10%
>>Secretary of
Defense Forrestal was

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.750 align:middle line:10%
the first real,
powerful, known person

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:53.220 align:middle line:10%
that was eliminated
because he was going

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:56.300 align:middle line:10%
to release the information.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has ever
paid for that crime.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.950 align:middle line:10%
A crime had never been really
thoroughly investigated

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:07.190 align:middle line:10%
by forces to see
what happened to him.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:11.430 align:middle line:10%
But most people know
that he was thrown

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:13.920 align:middle line:10%
out the window of the hospital.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't killed by
being thrown out the window,

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.900 align:middle line:90%
but he never got up alive.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>He was talking
about being erased.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%


01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, man, I said,
what do you mean, erased?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, you will be erased.

01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, how do
you know all this,

01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:39.840 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I know.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, they'll go after
not only you, he said,

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%
they'll go after your family.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Those were his words.

01:17:50.550 --> 01:18:40.837 align:middle line:90%


01:18:40.837 --> 01:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And they're yelling at me and
they're hollering and cursing,

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't see
anything, and we'll

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
do you and your
whole goddamn family.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically that for
about eight or nine hours.

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
These guys, they're
just off on their own.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no oversight,
no control.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.010 align:middle line:90%
They just do whatever they want.

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're evil.

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.290 align:middle line:90%
These people are evil.

01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Basically it's
an oversight group

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
intermingled with
the National Security

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Council and the National
Security Planning Group.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:13.270 align:middle line:90%
They have full control.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They have no congressional
oversight whatsoever.

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They answer to nobody,
except for the President

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But they're trying to push it
aside away from the president.

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:30.230 align:middle line:10%
>>When I was a corporate manager
of Fairchild Industries in 1974

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:36.960 align:middle line:10%
through '77, I met the late Dr.
Wernher Von Braun in early '74.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
At that time, Von Braun
was dying of cancer.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But he assured me that he would
live a few more years in order

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to tell me about the game
that was being played,

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that game being the
effort to weaponize space.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:56.522 align:middle line:10%
>>Weapons in space is
still a big enigma,

01:19:56.522 --> 01:19:58.720 align:middle line:10%
black covert operations.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Von Braun's purpose in
life during the last years

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of his life, his
dying years, was

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to educate the
public and decision

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
makers about why
space-based weapons are

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
dumb, dangerous,
destabilizing, too costly,

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:16.750 align:middle line:84%
unnecessary,
unworkable, undesirable.

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The strategy that Wernher
Von Braun taught me was that,

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
first, the Russians are going to
be considered to be the enemy.

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I met
him in '74, they

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
were the enemy, the
identified enemy.

01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
We were told that they
had killer satellites.

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
We were told that
they were coming

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to get us and control
us, the dirty commies,

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.684 align:middle line:90%
that whole story.

01:20:33.684 --> 01:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
First, the Russians
were the enemy

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.835 align:middle line:84%
against whom we were going
to build space-based weapons.

01:20:36.835 --> 01:20:38.940 align:middle line:10%
>>The ballistic
missile defense system

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:43.820 align:middle line:10%
is probably a pipe
dream in the sense

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:49.705 align:middle line:10%
that if what it's
designed for is that you

01:20:49.705 --> 01:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
know where it's coming from.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we had Russia,
there was a 50/50 chance

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that you knew about where
it would be coming from.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1977, I was at a meeting
in Fairchild Industries

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in a conference room
called the war room.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that room were a
lot of charts on the wall,

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
with enemies,
identified enemies,

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
names that people
had never heard of,

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
names like Saddam
Hussein and Gaddafi.

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.450 align:middle line:10%
But we were talking
then about terrorists,

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.200 align:middle line:10%
the potential terrorists.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.510 align:middle line:10%
No one had ever talked
about this before,

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.550 align:middle line:10%
but this was the next
stage after the Russians,

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:27.320 align:middle line:10%
against whom we were going
to build space-based weapons,

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.402 align:middle line:10%
these terrorists.

01:21:28.402 --> 01:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>They wanted a
weapons system they

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
could put in space that would
stop a ballistic missile.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.360 align:middle line:90%
That was the concept.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>This was 1977, and
they were talking

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
about creating a war in
the Gulf region, when there

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was $25 billion in the
space-based weapons

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%
program that yet had
not been identified.

01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't called the Strategic
Defense Initiative at least

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:56.240 align:middle line:90%
until 1983.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
This weapons system
then had obviously

01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
been going on for
some time, that I

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.920 align:middle line:90%
didn't know anything about.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>When Star Wars was brought
out as an idea, which

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:10.110 align:middle line:84%
was before Reagan
actually, and incorporated

01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
into his administration, it
became pretty much window

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
dressing, people would call it.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
of truth behind what

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:18.708 align:middle line:90%
they were trying to do.

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
They knew the basic principle
of what they wanted to do.

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>So I stood up in this
meeting in 1977 and said,

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know
why we're talking

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:31.316 align:middle line:84%
about space-based weapons
against these enemies.

01:22:31.316 --> 01:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know
more about this.

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Would somebody tell
me what this is about?

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Nobody answered.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
They went on with
this meeting as

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%
though I hadn't said anything.

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:42.050 align:middle line:90%
We heard a lot about terrorism.

01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we were going to identify
third world country crazies.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We now call them
nations of concern.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>With the rogue
nations we have today,

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.380 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely ludicrous.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>But he said that would be
the third enemy against whom

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
we would be needing to
build space-based weapons.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next enemy
was asteroids.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point,
he kind of chuckled

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.230 align:middle line:90%
the first time he said it.

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Asteroids-- against
asteroids we're

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
going to build
space-based weapons.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.050 align:middle line:90%
So it was funny then.

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And the funniest one of all
was against what he called

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:16.790 align:middle line:90%
aliens, extraterrestrials.

01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:19.240 align:middle line:90%
That would be the final card.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And over and over and
over during the four years

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that I knew him and was
giving his speeches for him,

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
he would bring up
that last card.

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And remember, Carol, the
last card is the alien card.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
build space-based weapons

01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:37.370 align:middle line:90%
against aliens.

01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of it, he
said, is a lie.

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:45.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, if they were
hostile, my own knowledge is

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.730 align:middle line:10%
and feeling-- I don't
know about all of them--

01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:51.940 align:middle line:10%
is that we could have
been with their weaponry

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.360 align:middle line:10%
as it might be used, it could
have destroyed us a long time

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.160 align:middle line:10%
ago.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>If beings can
travel in time space,

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
then anything we
would put in orbit

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
as a weapon would be like
going against Genghis

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Khan with a firecracker.

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:11.880 align:middle line:10%
>>Now, some would like
for us to believe and like

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.520 align:middle line:10%
to develop the idea that
the aliens and people are

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.070 align:middle line:10%
our enemy now.

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:19.640 align:middle line:10%
But that's not true.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>I noticed the
satellite's positionings.

01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is supposed to
be a system that tracks radar

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.640 align:middle line:90%
anomalies on Earth, right?

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.089 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing, the movement.

01:24:29.089 --> 01:24:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Yep, that's what it does.

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:31.671 align:middle line:84%
And I said, then
why are half of them

01:24:31.671 --> 01:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
pointed towards the outer
space, towards the moon,

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
towards areas that
are just blank space?

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.590 align:middle line:10%
>>I have concluded that I'm
fighting against the clock,

01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:46.000 align:middle line:10%
that I have but a short time
to try to convince people

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.740 align:middle line:10%
that we are moving
in an avenue where we

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.190 align:middle line:10%
are going to militarize space.

01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:52.660 align:middle line:10%
As a result of
militarizing space,

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.150 align:middle line:10%
we are going to
acquire new technology.

01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:58.240 align:middle line:10%
We're going to evolve
new technology.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, at least half of
those satellites you got up

01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:03.450 align:middle line:90%
there aren't looking at Earth.

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>>He had received several
transmissions from the Pentagon

01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:12.320 align:middle line:10%
and from other satellite
monitoring stations of the NSA

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:17.060 align:middle line:10%
that they were tracking ETVs.

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It stands for
Extraterrestrial Vehicles.

01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:22.965 align:middle line:84%
>>I said, what are
they looking for?

01:25:22.965 --> 01:25:24.340 align:middle line:84%
He says, well,
you've got to have

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.050 align:middle line:90%
to need to know about that.

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>We put nuclear weapons out
in space as a line of defense.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And we were to ready to blow
them up if they started in.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.452 align:middle line:90%
>>He didn't mention a timeline.

01:25:37.452 --> 01:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
it was going to be

01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
speeding up faster than
anybody could possibly imagine.

01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%


01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.070 align:middle line:10%
>>We just heard that in
the process of poring

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:54.110 align:middle line:10%
over that heat shield,
they found three more

01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:58.020 align:middle line:10%
objects floating in close
proximity to the space

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:01.330 align:middle line:10%
shuttle Atlantis, There
you go, one two and three.

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:04.052 align:middle line:10%
Unclear what those are,
maybe a fourth there.

01:26:04.052 --> 01:26:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Unclear what those are.

01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:06.050 align:middle line:10%
Could be ice.

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:09.830 align:middle line:10%
Could be little pieces
of harmless debris.

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.442 align:middle line:84%
Worst case scenario, could
be parts of the heat shield,

01:26:12.442 --> 01:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and that is why
NASA is concerned.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's very hard
to identify what

01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:19.440 align:middle line:90%
those little things might be.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:27:10.350 align:middle line:90%


01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>We are going to
acquire new technology.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to evolve
new technology that's

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
going to lead us into
interstellar travel.

01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:23.950 align:middle line:84%
As a direct result, we will
become a threat to them

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:26.600 align:middle line:90%
unless we spiritually grow also.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.475 align:middle line:84%
>>And in a memo that I
wrote to President Bush,

01:27:29.475 --> 01:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I stated that this
campaign will persist

01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:34.750 align:middle line:90%
until our goals are met.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are as follows-- that
we have open, honest hearings

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
on the subject in
the US Congress,

01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that there be a permanent ban
on the weaponization of space

01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
or the targeting of any objects
of extraterrestrial origin,

01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that there be a full
and complete study

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of classified
technologies connected

01:27:57.170 --> 01:28:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to this subject, specifically
technologies connected to UFO

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial vehicles.

01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
If declassified, and used for
peaceful energy generation

01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and propulsion would solve
the looming energy crisis

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.890 align:middle line:90%
definitively.

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>You don't need cars
unless you've got

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.470 align:middle line:90%
an internal combustion engine.

01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:23.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you have one
of these units, that's

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.390 align:middle line:10%
about 16 inches long and about
eight inches high and about

01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:30.890 align:middle line:10%
10 inches wide,
then you don't need

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:35.570 align:middle line:10%
to plug in to Kit Carson,
the local electric company.

01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It burns nothing-- no pollution.

01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It never wears out because
there's no moving parts.

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>>At the top, our news
here at 6 o'clock,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.650 align:middle line:10%
an age-old dream
becoming a reality.

01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:50.480 align:middle line:10%
A local inventor has
discovered a way-- hear this--

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.809 align:middle line:10%
to use water to run your car.

01:28:52.809 --> 01:28:54.350 align:middle line:10%
>>It's a major
breakthrough that will

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.970 align:middle line:10%
no doubt make motorists happy.

01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:58.530 align:middle line:10%
And as Ralph Robinson
explains, the Pentagon

01:28:58.530 --> 01:29:01.634 align:middle line:10%
is also showing lots of
interest in this project.

01:29:01.634 --> 01:29:03.050 align:middle line:10%
>>Water has always
been considered

01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:05.310 align:middle line:10%
a precious commodity, but
Stan Meyer's invention

01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:06.970 align:middle line:10%
may make it even more valuable.

01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:09.470 align:middle line:10%
He has developed what's
called a water fuel cell.

01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:11.740 align:middle line:10%
It has taken the place
of his old gas tank.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.130 align:middle line:10%
The water fuel cell breaks
down water molecules

01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.380 align:middle line:10%
into oxygen and
hydrogen. The hydrogen

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.862 align:middle line:10%
is used to run his dune buggy.

01:29:17.862 --> 01:29:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>>I don't care if you
use rainwater, wellwater,

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.580 align:middle line:10%
city water, or ocean water.

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.757 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have any fresh
water, go ahead and use snow.

01:29:24.757 --> 01:29:26.590 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have any
snow available to you,

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:29.070 align:middle line:10%
use salt water, because there's
no adverse effect to the fuel

01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.870 align:middle line:10%
cell.

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>>Meyer started working on
this project four years ago.

01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:33.400 align:middle line:10%
He's not a scientist.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.660 align:middle line:10%
He isn't even a chemist.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he never
graduated from college.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.140 align:middle line:10%
Meyer was determined, he

>>The Pentagon flew a
lieutenant colonel in last week

There is talk of possibly using
it in the Star Wars defense

program and to run Army tanks.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.190 align:middle line:10%
Meyer is currently providing
a water fuel cell for cars.

01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:03.170 align:middle line:10%
It will cost about $1,500.

01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:04.930 align:middle line:10%
He says it won't
need any maintenance

01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:06.346 align:middle line:10%
and you won't have
to replace it.

01:30:06.346 --> 01:30:08.720 align:middle line:10%
>>It will to be at least two
years before the fuel system

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.200 align:middle line:10%
goes into mass production.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.722 align:middle line:10%
The day it happens will be
one the fuel industry hates.

01:30:12.722 --> 01:30:14.180 align:middle line:10%
But it will put a
smile in the face

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:16.616 align:middle line:10%
of those who have had to
say at one time or another,

01:30:16.616 --> 01:30:17.600 align:middle line:10%

enormous range of new things

that have been worked up to a
remarkable level in the past

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:57.230 align:middle line:10%
and then suppressed by
the existing order for one

01:30:57.230 --> 01:30:59.280 align:middle line:10%
reason or another.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Either they're incompatible
with classical ideas

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
or they upset strong financial
interests or whatever

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.340 align:middle line:90%
it may be in the past.

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Great things have been
done by gifted humans.

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They are, in a sense, the
vehicles of God Almighty

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in bringing the
stuff into the world.

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And none of it has ever reached
public use and public currency

01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:25.780 align:middle line:10%
because of this dictatorship
of the knowledge

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.990 align:middle line:10%
systems of the world.

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:31.910 align:middle line:10%
Video, and in particular
projects like this one

01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:35.040 align:middle line:10%
we're on now, they
reveal that you

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:40.930 align:middle line:10%
can do to these ancient,
seemingly ancient discoveries

01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:44.030 align:middle line:10%
what was not possible or
feasible 50 years ago.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:47.180 align:middle line:10%
It was simply beyond
technical capabilities.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And the means of distributing
what you discovered

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.780 align:middle line:90%
were all in the wrong hands.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:56.040 align:middle line:10%
Nowadays, the internet
has put all that to bed.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.060 align:middle line:10%
You can't do that anymore.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Humanity is going to have
information no matter what.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.670 align:middle line:10%
So I see, in the things
that I know about and have

01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:11.100 align:middle line:10%
been personally involved with,
a great horizon for producing

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:15.740 align:middle line:10%
an endless series of productions
like this that will bring

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.360 align:middle line:10%
this stuff out of the limbo
where they've been shoved

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.840 align:middle line:10%
and into the full
light of day who

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.640 align:middle line:10%
are some of the bright young
people who are now on the earth

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.890 align:middle line:10%
can make them into
blessings for mankind.

01:32:25.890 --> 01:33:06.970 align:middle line:90%


01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I have concluded that
it's based on a few people

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
making a lot of money
and gaining power.

01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>We have cartels.

01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole set
of cartels in an area,

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:16.700 align:middle line:90%
interlocking corporations.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And behind this, we have a few
people who are quite wealthy

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.550 align:middle line:10%
and who own most things.

01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>It's about ego.

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Everybody's trying
to be the big monkey.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.000 align:middle line:90%
It's really as simple as that.

>>Who's control of
petroleum of the world?

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:32.230 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people think that
Iraq, Iran, and so and so.

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:38.370 align:middle line:10%
We control it, the us

and the other world interest.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.197 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people refer to
this, the secret government.

01:33:44.197 --> 01:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>But I would say that
in terms of profiting

01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:49.740 align:middle line:90%
from the status quo, big oil.

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.490 align:middle line:84%
There are certain geopolitical
and financial infrastructures

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that would does not welcome
a definitive replacement

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.370 align:middle line:90%
to the fossil fuels.

01:33:57.370 --> 01:33:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>So what we get is the
great Armageddon everybody's

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.730 align:middle line:90%
been dreading.

are playing an old,
dangerous, costly game

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
for their own pocketbooks
and power struggle.

01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:14.980 align:middle line:84%

right now don't

01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.910 align:middle line:84%

with other scientists who
are ready to come forward,

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that we already have
a complete replacement

01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:32.470 align:middle line:84%
for any fossil fuels or
ionizing nuclear power plants.

01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't need them.

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:34.690 align:middle line:90%
We haven't needed them.

01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Probably have not needed them
since the time I was born.

that has been going on
for the last 50 years

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:46.810 align:middle line:84%
is probably the
biggest single threat

01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to our democratic society.

to the survival of
the United States

that I've seen all this.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I know all this.

01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking around like
with the answer and nobody

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.290 align:middle line:90%
wants to ask the question.

01:35:05.290 --> 01:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%

to act to end this charade.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It's definitely time to
make a disclosure on this.

01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It's been kept secret too long.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things
that I'm upset about

01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:22.736 align:middle line:84%
is that good people are
forced to do illegal things.

01:35:22.736 --> 01:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
information should be

01:35:24.610 --> 01:35:26.470 align:middle line:90%
given to the American public.
