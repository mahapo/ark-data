>> When I was eight years old,
I had the habit of walking

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
through the fields and also
the forests that belonged

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:10%
to the farm where
we were living.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I was living with my
parents back then.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And in 1970, I was
eight years old.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:84%
During summer
vacation, one day I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
went walking in the forest,
and the forests to me--

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I was eight years old.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
The forest seemed magical
that day, seemed alive.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.515 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, I became
tired because it was very hot,

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
a hot summer day, and
I decided to sit down

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.715 align:middle line:90%
on a big rock, big, gray rock.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The rock was
surrounded by trees.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
After a few minutes,
I would say,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to me that the
trees became totally alive.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I became aware that
the trees were alive.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, I became
aware that even

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
the big, gray rock on which
I was sitting was alive.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
I realized that I

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
was part of a whole
continuum of life

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and that I was deeply
connected to the rock,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to the trees, even to the
fields, and so on and so forth.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, I had a vision of
what would be my future life

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and what was the goal of
my life plan, if you will.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
saw clearly that I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
was going to be involved
in a scientific movement.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
An historical
movement that would

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
show that, contrary to what we
had been thinking in science

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
in general and in neuroscience
in particular, what we call

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
mind and also spirits are not
at all produced by the brain.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
They are using the brain
to express themselves

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:90%
in our human experience.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it became
clear to me that I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
would become a
neuroscientist then

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and that I would be one of
the key figures involved

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in an historical movement
that would bring us

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
a new view, a new world view,
in which minds and consciousness

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and spirit would
play a key role.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would not be considered
as simple elements that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
are simply byproducts
of brain activity.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And this would create a global
transformation eventually.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was part of this process.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
is happening 40-some years

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
after that, after my
initial vision, because this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what other scientists
have realized as well based

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%
on certain experiments, studies.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
If we look at all
the evidence now,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more and more evident
that mind and consciousness

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and spirit are not simply
byproducts of brain activity.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, and also in
the view of my colleagues,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
this realization will
eventually lead us

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%

has led to a

by the evidence to
face the question.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up meeting
other scientists as well as

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
other people who
were highly credible,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
who awakened me
to the realization

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that not only was all of
this most likely true,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
but that in order to have
integrity as a scientist,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to be a genuine scientist,
I had to follow the data.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And if the data took me
to reject some of the ways

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that I had been educated

The Roman church, which
was the church, faced

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
with growing Reformation
movement activity,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
decided that they needed to
define what was their domain.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And in those 18 years,
over about 25 meetings,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
they determined and stated
that the domain of the church

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
was things of the spirit and
that it was their provence

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to control matters and study
into the matters of the spirit,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and that science,
which was then really

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
just beginning to emerge,
could handle everything

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't just
make a statement,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
they focused the
Inquisition on this.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And so for not
just a generation,

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%

hundred years, if you

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
got involved in matters
of consciousness-- now,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:90%
people did, of course.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you became too
prominent and too public

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
about your views
of consciousness,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
you stood a very good chance of
being burned alive or tortured

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:90%

was that scientists--

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
two things.

Scientists, OK, we get
into trouble if we do that.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing was
that science as a process

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:84%
was very new, and
so there were lots

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of things to discover
in the spacetime world.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And the church was
OK with that, so they

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:84%
focused on the physical
world, physical reality.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And over the generations,
because this went on

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
for multiple
generations, getting

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
involved with consciousness
was just a bad move

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:90%
if you were a scientist.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the last person
killed by the Inquisition

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
was in 1826 in Spain.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
A man was garroted
for teaching deism.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think what happened
was that what started out

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
as a warning became a
taboo, became something

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.135 align:middle line:90%

consciousness has
simply vanished,

materialism,

basically says consciousness

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:10%
The second aspect of the
emerging postmaterialist

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:10%
paradigm is the
recognition that mind,

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:10%
for instance will, intention,
thoughts, act as a force,

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:10%
because it has the capacity to
transform the world physically,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:10%
biologically.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can alter what's going
on in our brains, for instance,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
by changing our thoughts, our
emotions, our belief systems.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
to not only change

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
the activity of the brain region
involved in those processes,

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but also the structure of the
brain itself, white matter

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:90%
and gray matter for instance.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And this action of
the mind as a force

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
is not restricted,
confined, to the limits

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
of the body, because it
can exert an impact that we

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:90%
call non-local.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, beyond the
limits of our body.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's not limited to a
specific point in space,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
like the brain or
the body, and nor

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is it restricted to a
specific point in time,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:90%
such as the present.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
important element.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect is that what
we call mind and consciousness

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world,
they appear superficially

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to be separated
in our experience.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, they
are not separated.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
They are deeply
interconnected, which

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
allows for the interaction
between mind and matter,

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And they are totally, or
deeply, interconnected

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
because they arise out
of a common source,

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:84%
a common principle, that
is at the origin of both

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
the mental world and
the physical world.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, it is what
we could call consciousness,

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but with a big C, compared
to our consciousness

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:90%
at the human level.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, another major
aspect of this new paradigm

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that it's not
the brain that produces

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:90%
mind and consciousness.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Mind and consciousness,
rather, use the brain

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.765 align:middle line:84%
to express themselves
and manifest themselves.

>> What does
consciousness mean to me?

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:10%
I have the feeling that
I am aware of myself,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:10%
so consciousness is
certainly self-awareness.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:10%
I can infer that other
people probably also

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of awareness.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So from an idea of
separate objects,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
separate people
having this quality,

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.480 align:middle line:84%
this interiority
quality, that's one way

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about consciousness.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:10%
From another perspective,
because I am also a meditator,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:10%
I recognize that what
I'm talking about here

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:10%
is like a surface
level of awareness.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
We begin to deep
down in awareness,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.170 align:middle line:84%
it begins to diffuse in a
way, and so the separation

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:90%
begins to disappear.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness is
a very large term.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:84%
It probably can be
thought of in terms

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:90%
of many levels of hierarchy.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But our minds naturally
try to carve up things,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
so there really is no hierarchy,
or levels, or anything.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
we think about it.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I think consciousness
is what everything

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:90%
is made out of in a sense.

what consciousness is.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
could they do the

perhaps telepathic interaction?

I don't see why not.

they'd have an effect?

I don't know.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that we
do know from experiments

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is that when you begin to look
at the distribution of talent

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:84%
for these kinds of phenomena
among the general population,

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:84%
it looks very much
like a bell curve.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So most people are going to
fit in the middle of the curve.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get a
small percentage who

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
are very far out on the right
side of the curve, which

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is very high
talent, and they can

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
do things that seem impossible,
except that they can do it.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:84%

think of it is it's

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:84%

like an Olympic athlete.

has come about to mean
know of something else.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in my
view, consciousness

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:40.020 align:middle line:84%
means just the knowledge or the
awareness of something, which

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
can be consciousness
of one's own self,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:84%
so I prefer the term
awareness or pure awareness.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:52.140 align:middle line:84%

only one word, consciousness,

consciousness, or consciousness

00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:06.570 align:middle line:84%

the consciousness associated

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.450 align:middle line:84%

the concept of the Logos.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
The Logos means
exactly that say Menas.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a continuum of the energy.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because in theology,

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:84%
when we read them the gospel
of St. John in old Greek,

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:90%
we see the word "Logos."

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And John writes Logos
means God, the energy,

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:90%
the continuum of the energy.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So postmaterialist,
it's very interesting,

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.920 align:middle line:84%
because postmaterialist
is exactly

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the continuity of all
the acknowledge that we

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:90%
know in theology, for example.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Or in Buddhism, when Dalai
Lama explained that Buddhism,

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not a religion, it's
a science of the mind.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:39.280 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly like when
[INAUDIBLE],, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:10%
the last descendant
of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:10%
the first disciple of the
Buddha, who wrote the teaching.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE] say to me all
the time, all is interdependent.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know in science
and with postmaterialist,

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
as explained also
Dr. Mario Beauregard,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that our emotions are connected
to every cell of our body.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It is the reason why,
when we are stressed,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:90%
we destroy our immune system.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we are calmer
in our daily lives,

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:90%
we upgrade our immune system.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So all is impermanent,
all is interdependent.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And postmaterialist is
a continuity of all the

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%

for the soul of science.

00:41:59.305 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:10%
I talk about looking
for the soul of science,

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.280 align:middle line:10%

two different things.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:10%
So just to clarify, I see
the science of the soul

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:10%
as taking the
scientific process,

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:10%
the beautiful
scientific process,

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:21.660 align:middle line:10%
the deep scientific process of
being inspired about something,

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:10%
and then being drawn and
compelled to study it,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.728 align:middle line:10%
and then discovering
that you were wrong.

00:42:27.728 --> 00:42:30.020 align:middle line:84%
That's usually pretty much
the next thing that happens.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You discover that
you were wrong,

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
but you don't care,
because now you're

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:90%
in love with the question.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.775 align:middle line:90%
about what they found.

00:42:39.775 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And doing that
loop, and I called

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that the deep
scientific process.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So the science of
your soul, or I

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
call it the science of the
work of your soul, that's

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:84%
about taking that process
and applying it to your soul,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to taking
the same process

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and applying it to a star system
in another galaxy, or a virus

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and how it replicates, or any
other thing that we normally

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
think of taking the scientific
process and applying it to.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
But the science of your soul
is about taking that same

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.920 align:middle line:84%
process-- because science is
like a verb, it's a process--

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and applying it to your soul.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it means doing
experiments in your life

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and with your soul,
with awareness

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of your inner self,
and your inner state,

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and your authentic self
to find out who you are

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and what you can
bring to the world.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:84%

different thing, but not

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.980 align:middle line:84%
at all a different thing,
in a way, from the sight

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:35.370 align:middle line:90%
the soul of science.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me the
soul of science,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:84%
if we're sticking with
the definition of soul

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:84%
as the thing that
connects the little c

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.910 align:middle line:84%
individual consciousness
to the sort big C--

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not really anywhere, so I
put it everywhere-- the big C

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:84%
If science has a soul like
a human being has a soul,

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.150 align:middle line:84%
then it would be something
that connects the act of doing

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
science-- the verb of science,
or the process of science--

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.587 align:middle line:84%
to the greater whatever
you want to call it.

00:44:05.587 --> 00:44:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The thing that we
can never figure out

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:11.235 align:middle line:84%

or whatever it is,
nature, the universe.

the soul of science,

of looking at that.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:84%

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.430 align:middle line:84%
One of these evidences
concerns what

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.350 align:middle line:84%
we called the
near-death experience,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience or NDs.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They are very vivid and
realistic experiences

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that have profound
consequences that

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:84%
very often lead to a
psychospiritual transformation

for the experiencers.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
occur when the individual

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.170 align:middle line:84%
is physiologically or
psychologically close to death.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
near-death experience

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.700 align:middle line:90%
is induced by a cardiac arrest.

Then when there's
a cardiac arrest,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a cessation of the blood
flow to the brain very rapidly.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you are measuring
the electrical activity

vanishes totally, usually

state of clinical death.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.470 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of state, in
principle, the experiencer

as far as I can recall,

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:10%
I had no spiritual
experiences whatsoever.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:10%
And I was not aware of
even the possibility

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:37.460 align:middle line:10%
of having spiritual experiences
until after I became

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.770 align:middle line:10%
a tenured professor at Yale.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And then spiritual experiences
became more frequent

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:84%
as I opened myself
up to the possibility

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:90%
of having those experiences.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were
evidential, meaning

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that I could independently
verify that experiences

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that I was having, information
that I was receiving

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:14.190 align:middle line:84%
was related to life and
to my personal life.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget an event that
happened when I was struggling

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.860 align:middle line:84%
with was there a greater
reality and could we

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.755 align:middle line:84%
communicate with some sort
of higher consciousness?

00:53:27.755 --> 00:53:33.125 align:middle line:84%
And in a book I wrote called
"The G.O.D. Experiments," where

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:37.700 align:middle line:84%
G.O.D. stands for guiding,
organizing, designing process,

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I confessed how one could ask
a question of the universe

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and then have
information be received

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:90%
which one could validate.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And I included an account
where I asked the universe

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.690 align:middle line:84%
for another name for God,
because that word has

00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:01.940 align:middle line:84%
so many negative connotations to
many people, including myself.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And what popped into my head was
the name Sam, which I thought

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:90%
was ridiculous.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought either it was
my creative unconscious

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
or I was experiencing
a Woody Allen movie.

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But then when I went
to the dictionary

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and looked up the
root of the word Sam,

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.870 align:middle line:84%
which of course is
short for Samuel,

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that it actually
comes from the ancient Hebrew.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And it actually means
"the name for God,"

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:84%
which I certainly did
not know and most people

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:42.030 align:middle line:84%
that I knew at that
time didn't know either.

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I began to learn that
these ancient traditions,

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:49.500 align:middle line:84%
for example, of under
the right circumstances

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.190 align:middle line:84%
asking questions and then
allowing information to come,

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.930 align:middle line:84%
could be received in ways
which we could then empirically

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.850 align:middle line:90%
verify.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I, in part of
my own personal life

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.360 align:middle line:84%
now, practice what I call
evidence-based faith,

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:90%
or evidence-based spirituality.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.510 align:middle line:84%
A self-science approach,
which I've learned

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.410 align:middle line:84%

the Academy when, in fact,

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Gary Schwartz originally asked
me if I would co-organize it

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:10%
with him, because just
hearing that name,

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.500 align:middle line:10%
the Academy of
Postmaterialist Sciences,

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.730 align:middle line:10%
made me incredibly joyful and
hopeful that we actually might

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:05.180 align:middle line:10%
change our limited way of
looking at the universe.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I also noted that when I
would tell my colleagues that

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.120 align:middle line:84%
do a little
meditation in addition

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to their neuroscience
research, or my students who

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.830 align:middle line:84%
happen to be interested in
these areas about the fact

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:17.570 align:middle line:84%
that we were
forming the Academy,

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:90%
their faces would light up.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
can I join too?

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.040 align:middle line:90%
When will this start?

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
there was a hunger

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:27.290 align:middle line:84%
for people to actually
begin to explore

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:29.072 align:middle line:90%
this in a very public way.

00:56:29.072 --> 00:56:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of the reasons
I want to be part of it

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we have been hiding
our dual nature as scientists

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and meditators, people
interested in spirituality way

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:40.280 align:middle line:90%
too long.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we hide it and
we don't talk about it,

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:48.380 align:middle line:84%
other people are not even
aware that we have this broader

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.830 align:middle line:90%
understanding of consciousness.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think that once we
really roll out the society,

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:56.940 align:middle line:84%
we will find that many, many
more scientists in the world

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and other people
beyond scientists

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.260 align:middle line:90%
have had similar experiences.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And people will
begin to share it

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.160 align:middle line:84%
in a whole new way
that allows them

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to feel comfortable,
and not isolated,

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.330 align:middle line:90%
having these experiences.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And in this quantum
universe, the observer

00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.960 align:middle line:90%
plays a very important role.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.940 align:middle line:84%
The observer is
part of the system.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.213 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you cannot conceive
of the system without

00:58:30.213 --> 00:58:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the observer, who is
part of the system.

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You cannot think of somehow
the observer being somewhere

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:41.330 align:middle line:84%

by itself.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the universe and the
observer forming one system.

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you ask
questions about the universe,

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.293 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask what is
the role of the observer.

and I realize that it's
simplified a little bit.

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in views
such as Richard Feynman,

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and Bohr before him, and
John Archibald Wheeler,

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:14.750 align:middle line:84%
you can't even say that quantum
particles, or quantum entities,

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.710 align:middle line:84%
quanta in general even have
properties until an observation

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:18.510 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:21.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a very radical idea
in a Cartesian universe,

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:26.210 align:middle line:84%
because in a Cartesian universe,
the particles are definite.

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They have definite properties.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:32.730 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is to observe
them, and there they are.

until an observation

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.430 align:middle line:84%

observation is very important.

And the context
of the observation

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:43.400 align:middle line:90%
is tied to the observer.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.950 align:middle line:84%
It's tied to the
observational choices

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that the observer makes.

[INAUDIBLE] as being primary,

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:90%
then this will not make sense.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Then you say, well--

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's why, in fact,
this paradigm, this quantum

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
paradigm, is so radical within
the classical point of view.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense in the
classical point of view.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, that crazy
from what point of view?

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the point of view
of the sensory mind-body point

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
of view, which lives in
four-dimensional spacetime,

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
which thinks itself as a
four-dimensional mechanical

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.600 align:middle line:90%
entity.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Mind-body.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We think ourselves as being
mind-body, and that's it.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you expand that
horizon, say, well,

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
we're beyond a four-dimensional
mind-body the entity.

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.038 align:middle line:90%
We're more than that.

01:01:37.038 --> 01:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Then the boundaries
begin to break down.

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
quantum universe.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
So then the question arises--

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.010 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Is the quantum universe
crazy, or the way

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
we view the universe is crazy?

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a valid question.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the question
arises-- what is really crazy?

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is crazy, it's just
a different perspective.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.557 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with the quantum view,

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing wrong
with the classical view.

In a postmaterialist scientific
community, first of all,

01:02:42.165 --> 01:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
people would spend

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
more time stilling their
minds, quieting their minds.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
actually what meditation

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
does is it increases our
compassion for ourselves

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and for other people.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you increase
your compassion

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
for yourself and
for others, you tend

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to feel much more
interconnectedness.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.403 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you stop
feeling that separation

01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
between yourself
and other people,

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%

nurture the people around you,

the world around you,
the animals around you.

bring our world into a much

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
more loving balance,

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%

So why we are stressed?

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
causalities of the stress,

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
it's because our mind,
it's too much small.

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.930 align:middle line:90%
We have fears.

01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:33.520 align:middle line:90%
We have doubt.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of problems
because we see our life

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.020 align:middle line:90%
through a little perception.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, we are
afraid of the death.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
We think the death, this
is the end of the life.

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But in postmaterialism,
we expand our reality.

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We expand our
perception of the life.

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:03.820 align:middle line:10%
And we realize, like
Albert Einstein explained,

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.350 align:middle line:10%
that our perception
of the world, it's

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:11.450 align:middle line:10%
an illusion of
the consciousness.

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:14.230 align:middle line:84%
We realize, for
example, for the death,

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:17.310 align:middle line:90%
that there is a continuum.

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Death, life, it's like seasons.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It's cycles, and
cycles, and cycles,

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%

energy, like Dr. Mario

Beauregard and Professor
Gary Schwartz explained.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important, because when

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
we have another
perception of reality,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
when we have a true
perception of reality,

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
when we expand our reality,
suddenly we feel better.

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:56.190 align:middle line:90%
We have less fears, less doubt.

01:05:56.190 --> 01:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
We have more care,
and it's easier

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to stop our brain from
running all the time.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So I really think that
postmaterialist perception

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of the reality,
it's a wonderful way

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to be more happy, to be more
calm, to become intelligent.
