00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Well, I was flying with
a crop circle researcher.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:05.465 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We were flying to the southwest
of the field here, and

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I went over a fixed route
that I do many times, so

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:14.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I know all the fields in the
area. And on my way out,

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
there was no crop circle
in this particular area.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It was close to -- fairly close
to -- the canal in the middle of

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.383 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
the Vale of Pewsey.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
We were no more than 10 minutes,

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:28.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we circled a few times, came
back, and on the way back,

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
there was a crop circle
in the field.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I pointed it out to the
crop circle researcher, and we

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:39.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
both agreed that that
crop circle was not there on the

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
way out, on the journey on the
way out. So it must have

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:48.709 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
appeared during daylight within
10 or 15 minutes, maximum.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And I couldn't see any people in
the field, I could see no cars,

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there were no roads going to the
field, just a small farm track.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:02:01.088 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I couldn't see how it could
be made in 10 or 15 minutes.

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:30.384 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;The impressions that I have
of the crop circles that

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:33.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there is no way they could be
made by humans. There is no way.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They are so complex,
they are so wonderful.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think it brings people
together from all over the world

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And it's art in a wonderful way.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
You know, it's so weird.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It seems to happen
all within minutes.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.286 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's impossible to understand
how it's done.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.775 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Every summer, hundreds of

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.813 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
these strange patterns appear
in fields all over the world.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:36.083 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
What on Earth are they?
Who has created them?

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:40.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Why do they do it, and
what is their meaning?

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:48.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It happens in wheat,
barley, oats, rye, rape.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It happens in sand, and even in
snow and ice during the winter.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It happens where the landscape
can be used as a huge canvas.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:09.516 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Are some jokers out just trying
to create a little attention?

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.819 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's easy to jump
to that conclusion.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.989 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But that's before you take a
closer look at this phenomenon.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When one studies the crop
circles, close at hand and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.063 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in detail, it's impossible to
avoid that strange feeling

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that something else might be
behind it all.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It's impressive to see how the
crop has been laid flat.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Firstly, the edges have
been clean cut --

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.886 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
no trampling nor bending.

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:49.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's as though the crop has been
combed with a huge comb.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.594 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
From the air it looks as if

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
a giant stamp has been
used in the field.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.233 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
The phenomenon often starts

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.904 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in early summer when the crop
is green, and continues

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.773 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
right up to harvesting.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It normally happens during the
night, but

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
sometimes in the
middle of the day.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
In a surprising way,

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.691 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the crop has been flattened
with great precision.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.737 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And no formation is alike,
or seems to be half-finished.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:41.174 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The complexity varies, but even
so, the beauty in the symbols

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.111 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the overwhelming geometry
is really astounding.

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The mystery and the wonder
are just as great

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.922 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
every time they are discovered.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.992 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And the enormous size of many
of these patterns makes

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:02.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the whole phenomenon even more
incomprehensible.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;If you look at the Milk Hill
formation, now you only have

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:28.154 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
4 hours of night, I should say,
and it was raining.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now when I went in it first
thing in the morning,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there was no sign of any mud on
the stalks, they were dead flat,

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and it was very, very
meticulous, and there's no way

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.769 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you could put that pattern down
in 4 hours of darkness.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.105 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And you've got to remember,
this area of Britain,

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.941 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you're not in total darkness --
you're in semi-darkness.

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:50.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now I know for a fact that night
there were people on the hill,

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.746 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and to make something that big,

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.315 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you would have had to have made
a certain amount of noise,

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:59.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and nobody heard anything
or saw anything.

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.366 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Who are putting down
these patterns?

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.602 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What is creating
these formations?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.471 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
It still remains a mystery.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.906 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Theories are many,
which of course makes

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the whole phenomenon
even more interesting.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so far, the fields of
southern England have been

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:28.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
canvas for most of
these crop formations.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.856 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Southern England, which appears
to resemble a huge crop field

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:40.527 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in itself, is divided up by
small villages crisscrossed

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:45.065 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with twisting canals and roads.
So this is where

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:49.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
crop circles have been
registered in great numbers.

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The first were
already being observed

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.721 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
several hundred years ago,
and were often seen as the work

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:12.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
of the devil, as here, depicted
in a copper engraving from 1678.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.997 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Or one thought that elves had
danced in the crop fields,

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.799 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and left elf rings.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Over and over,
there is nearly no decade where

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:28.508 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we don't have crop circle
reports. And there are

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.278 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so many witness of early crop
circles. Many families,

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
just talk to them, they remember
having played in crop circles

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
when they were kids, and
remember stories from

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
their parents and even their
grandparents about

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:43.757 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
the crop circles.

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And there is,... around the
world we can find that

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.229 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the crop circles have played
such an important part in the

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
daily life even centuries ago,
that they have become

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
part of the folklore and
part of the culture.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
As early as in the 1920s, crop
circles were reported

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:01.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
frequently in England.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:05.445 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But it wasn't until the 1980s
and '90s that interest grew.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And that's when
the dimensions and complexity

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
became truly sensational.

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
In recent years,

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.756 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
some 100 to 300 crop circles
have appeared here each summer.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
What is so special
about this area?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In the southwestern
part of England, we find

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.935 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
many imposing monuments that are
several thousand years old,

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:31.004 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that still pose
many questions to

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:34.874 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
archeologists and historians,
especially the question, Why?

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:40.847 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Stonehenge, approximately 4,500
years old, is the most famous.

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The original outer continuous
circle was constructed of huge

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:47.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
standing stones, each weighing
several tons, with lintels

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:51.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
posed very precisely
on top of them.

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:53.726 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What is this, and
why was it built?

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.729 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
No one, in all certainty,
can explain.

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.308 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The majestic stone circle
in Avebury is also one of

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:10.977 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the great mysteries
of this area.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:14.047 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It's actually the world's
largest stone circle.

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:15.949 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And some of the stones here

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.884 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
have the weight of over
a hundred tons.

00:10:17.884 --> 00:10:22.121 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Set up by people, primitive
people, 5000 years ago.

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:34.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Silbury Hill, the largest
prehistoric mound in Europe,

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
40 meters high and
built 4,600 years ago.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Beneath the grass
now covering the hill

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:49.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
are seven layers of stone --
seven stone terraces.

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But what the purpose was
for building it

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
still remains a mystery.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:59.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But this was by no doubt
built as a tomb.

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Not very pleasant, actually.

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:06.533 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And it's from the same period,
five to six thousand years ago.

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:09.836 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
West Kennet Long Barrow

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:14.107 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is situated quite close
to Silbury Hill and Avebury.

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But is it just a coincidence
that so many of the English crop

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:22.549 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
circles seem to appear close
to these ancient sites?

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:29.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
A number of white horses clearly
visible in the hillsides

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:33.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
are also characteristic of
the Wiltshire area.

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The white chalk soil is very
common here in Wiltshire, and

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:45.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
these white horses are exposed
by removing the top turf.

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:48.174 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Some of these horses,
the eldest ones,

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.243 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
are more than 2000 years old.

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:56.482 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So, can the mysteries
of the past have anything

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
to do with today's crop circles?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Are there special energies
in these areas that could

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
attract such rare phenomena?

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Is it something to do with
the water-bearing chalk hills

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.796 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that create special energy?

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:15.501 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We actually got the databases
for a period of seven years,

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:19.005 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and plotted where every
crop formation that was

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:21.341 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the databases, and
we searched several

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.544 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
databases within England.

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We plotted where those crop
circles occurred, and then

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:31.584 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
looked for correlations with
sacred sites, pilgrim routes.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.253 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And we found a strong
correlation with chalk and...

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:39.592 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
first of all, we thought this
was THE correlation...

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.194 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and we thought, well, there's a
lot of places with chalk

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:46.532 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
where crop circles don't occur.
What's happening there?

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.435 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And as we looked into chalk
more, we discovered that

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:54.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
actually chalk is the main
aquifer base for 

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:56.275 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
southern England.

00:12:56.275 --> 00:13:01.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We found that 98 percent of all
crop circles in Southern England

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:06.986 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
are located above aquifers --
underground water.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:10.023 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And to put that in perspective,
there's only aquifers

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:11.991 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
under 40 percent of
the land mass of Britain.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, that 98 percent was a
really convincing statistic.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:19.699 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But what we also discovered
was that it's not just

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:24.103 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
underground water. It has to be
potentized underground water.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:28.708 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's water which is activated
by the currents of Earth energy

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:32.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which course through the ground,
and they're very strong

00:13:32.445 --> 00:13:36.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in this Avebury area,
for example.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.087 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Well, there is one view,
particularly from

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:44.123 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
people that dowse, using rods
and pendulums and things,

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that ancient man instinctively
knew where these areas were

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.532 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of underground water, and where
these natural energies were,

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:55.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so ancient man instinctively
placed their areas there

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:59.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on the sites where we now have
stone circles, burial mounds,

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:02.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
whatever. Because they were
drawn to the same thing that

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:05.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
maybe is generating
the crop circles today.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So therefore it would stand to
reason that they would

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.651 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
cluster in the same areas
as these ancient sites.

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But it's not only in England
that crop circles appear.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.092 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In recent years,
reports have been coming in

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
from all over the world.

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:24.063 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So crop circles are now
a worldwide phenomenon.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.899 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;In total, over 10,000

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.203 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
crop circles have been
registered on a world basis: 

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:34.073 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the United States, Canada,
Australia, in the Far East,

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:38.144 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and of course in Germany,
Holland, Belgium, Poland, Italy,

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:43.683 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and in
many other European countries.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:54.193 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But again, how does this come
about? When one looks at

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the beautiful patterns
and the perfect geometry,

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.299 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it's difficult to believe
that it's purely coincidence,

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.935 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
a natural occurrence,
or just wind that has

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
wreaked havoc on the crop.

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.174 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If that were the case, It might
rather have looked like this.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Or is it just that people
are behind all this?

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:16.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In 1991 two pensioners
in England by the names of

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.752 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Doug Bower and Dave Chorley
announced that they were

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.855 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
responsible for all the crop
circles of the past 12 years,

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:25.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the help of planks, ropes
and tape measures.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.995 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But they were quickly shown
to be bluffing. It became clear

00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:31.964 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
when they were invited
to create a crop pattern.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Rightly so, there is
no doubt that

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
people have been responsible
for making some of them.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.578 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And even some of the more
advanced ones, too.

00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:48.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
An advertising company
made this one.

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:51.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It took several days,
and was completed in daylight.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:57.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;There doesn't seem to be any
random, uniform mechanism to the

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:00.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
actual things going down at all.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Interestingly, I've seen
hoaxes go down and it's taken,

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
like, 8 or 9 hours to make a
fairly basic pattern, you know?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And then I've seen highly
sophisticated, huge patterns,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a thousand feet wide,
and they've appeared in

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:17.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a few hours of darkness.
3 or 4 hours, sometimes.

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:20.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I mean the British summertime is
actually very short nights,

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.782 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we're looking at
gets dark around about...

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:26.485 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
fully dark around about 11pm,
and it's light again

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
by around about 4am.

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know it's a pretty small
window, and so many circles,

00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:33.693 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you know, the size, the scope
and the complexity --

00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:37.997 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
taking into account the
topographical considerations --

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:44.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it does beg the question: How on
earth could that be done?

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:49.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Also the fact that over 80
eyewitnesses have, over the past

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:53.713 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
20 years, seen crop circles
created in just seconds,

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.748 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
leaves little doubt that
a large number of crop circles

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.984 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
remain an unsolved mystery.

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:02.688 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I for instance discovered a crop
circle, literally a circle,

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:07.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the largest or the second
largest circle ever made.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It was in a formation
that was called The Snail

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.131 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in, I think it was '92.

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:16.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I happened to be going off
to the dentist quite early

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in the morning, and saw a shadow
in the field, in Eastfield.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.777 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I thought Wha...? and I
walked.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And it was... it had rained all
night and we were on clay soil,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:34.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so by the time I got there my
feet were weighing pounds, and

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I was covered in clay.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.624 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I can honestly say that
that circle was pristine.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:43.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That there wasn't any dirt on it
anywhere. And I just know if

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:47.166 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
people had trampled on it, even
in bare feet, they would have

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:52.004 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
left a lot of mud, and a lot
of marks. So I personally don't

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:55.841 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
believe that they're
all manmade, by a long way.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:59.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;I have the feeling that it
has to be done probably from

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
some external force, and we just
don't know the technology

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.684 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that they're using.
It's something that

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we don't know exists, I think.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:10.156 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I used to think that
it was manmade and, ok,

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:15.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
there are manmade circles about,
but I think when you

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
analyze them closely,
this has got to be done by

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.433 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
some external force, and to
say... I should think it's

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
some technology that we just
don't know -- we haven't

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
come across it yet.
We're still learning.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;There are many theories
as to what might be behind

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the crop circle phenomenon,
from extraterrestrials to

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Earth energies or spirits,
or perhaps even

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a natural weather phenomenon.
Nobody's really sure.

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:42.621 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I guess that's the big
question in the crop circles-

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.991 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it's something that everybody
talks about all the time.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.029 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;A paranormal phenomenon
for everyone to see,

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:52.231 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and every summer, people
are gathering from

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
all over the world
to study this.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And if not for any other reason,
the crop circles obviously

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
have the ability to
make people interact.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:15.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Also, I just find that the she
aesthetic of the way that the

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:19.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
leaves are all laid down
in a swirl in this kind of

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
rhythmic movement is
just something that...

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:28.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I can't conceive of anything
but some amazingly powerful

00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:30.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
higher force could do, you know?

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:32.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;And when something
this magnificent is such a

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:35.875 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
wonderful gift to us, we have
to feel good about ourselves.

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:39.545 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Wow, we've been given this gift,
and we can enjoy it, and

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.881 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
be grateful for it.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.516 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You've got to remember-
everybody that walks

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:48.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
into that field, the first thing
they're going to do is

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
be aware of how they feel.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That's what these patterns do.
They get you back in touch

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:56.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
with the energy that is you --
that feeling that's inside,

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, how long has it been
since a lot of these people

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:02.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
even contacted
that side of themselves?

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And by going into these
patterns, it makes you aware

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:07.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of yourself again.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It gets you in touch with
that feeling side, because

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:13.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
humanity's become a little bit
insensitive in a lot of ways.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.114 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And the patterns are
starting to help people

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:18.951 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to rediscover, redefine that
sensitivity, so that humanity

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:24.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
can work as one again, instead
of little individual islands.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.694 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;So how can one actually prove
that there is something

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:32.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
paranormal, supernatural, or
extraterrestrial being

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
behind all this?
And if there is, what it is?

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many crop circle researchers
have been engaged in

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
trying to find differences in
the crop and soil inside

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:45.511 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
compared to outside
the formations.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:47.546 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
If this, for example,

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.515 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
has been exposed
to heavy electromagnetic force,

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.283 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
one should be able
to find traces of it.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.056 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Most importantly, visual traces
can be found on the crop

00:20:57.056 --> 00:21:02.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
within many circles. Very often
you can see where one or several

00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:05.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
nodes of the actual crop
stem have been expanded, so as

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:10.236 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to be double and sometimes even
more than its natural length.

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:13.339 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This can indicate that the crop
has been rapidly heated up,

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:16.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and that the humidity inside the
stem has been subjected to

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.577 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
steam pressure, which
in turn has led to

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.946 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the node's being stretched.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.482 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
On some of the stem nodes
you can also clearly see

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:26.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where the steam has forced
its way out, and left

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
expulsion cavities.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This can be an indication that
the crop has been subjected to

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:35.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a rapid and powerful
microwave effect.

00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:39.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;If you see either of those
effects, chances are very good

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:42.601 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you're looking at a genuine
crop circle.

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:49.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There are a number of
changes in the plants that

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:53.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
have not been documented
scientifically, which

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.749 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
may also indicate the
likelihood that it's genuine.

00:21:56.749 --> 00:22:00.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For instance, the lay -- the
detail of the lay of the crop.

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:03.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But that has not
been evaluated scientifically.

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's more just what
people notice, you know,

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:08.827 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
from being in them so much.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:13.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Sometimes, I've seen areas
where the plants are bent over

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.236 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
say, 10-15 cm off the ground.

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So that to walk through the
formation, it's crunching

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.676 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
under your feet, like snow.

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:26.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So you think, well, somebody
hasn't been here before.

00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:31.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Another sign one can find,
especially in wheat,

00:22:31.617 --> 00:22:35.788 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is when the corn has dried and
turned golden in late summer.

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:39.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the standing crop, the ears
are stiffened in a bent position

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:43.062 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
due to their weight, and are
impossible to straighten out.

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:47.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But within the crop circle
the ears have actually

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:50.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
been straightened out
and then stiffened again

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.605 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in this position.

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:00.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The research group,
BLT Research, which is

00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:04.049 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
running scientific publicized
research on crop circles,

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:07.486 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is also engaged in
a systematic trial of the soil,

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.688 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and have often found
strange metal particles

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:12.825 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the upper layers of the soil
within the crop circles.

00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:16.195 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A specialist from America
is analyzing these tests.

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;And he pulverizes the dirt
and then runs it through

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:23.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
various grates, and with
very strong magnets

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:26.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
draws out the magnetic
particles, weighs them --

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:29.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
well, weighs
the whole soil sample first,

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
then weighs the amount
of particles,

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:36.682 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so we know how many particles
per gram of soil.

00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:41.553 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Then once we've done that,
extracted them, we send them

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:46.158 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
off to the west coast to a
mineralogist who does SCMEDS,

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:49.962 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the idea then is to
determine what they're made of.

00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:55.301 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The soil work indicates
the presence of a magnetic iron

00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:58.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
-- tiny little spherules
of magnetic iron

00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
-- and it's not only their
presence which is of interest,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's the manner in which they're
distributed: frequently around

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:09.648 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the periphery of these circles,
sometimes distributed linearly,

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
indicating a delivery system
that's fairly sophisticated.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;This research group has also
found interesting effects

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tied to the growth of a crop
within the circles.

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:24.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Some of the results clearly
show that when those energies,

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:29.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
when this crop circle-making
system impacts the plants,

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
if they're not mature,
if the seed is not formed,

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
what happens is that
those seeds are dehydrated,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they won't,
they don't mature properly,

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:41.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and they don't produce new
seeds, or new plants.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.916 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If that were to happen all over
the world simultaneously,

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:47.219 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we'd lose our food stock.
Obviously that's important.

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:51.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In addition, the germination
work shows that when these

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:55.361 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
energies impact the plants,
later on when the seed is

00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:59.698 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
fully developed, then you get
this very energized effect.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:02.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Levengood and Burke were able to
demonstrate that that was due

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:05.771 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to these very precise
electrical pulses.

00:25:05.771 --> 00:25:08.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And out of that grew their
discovery of how

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:10.042 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to replicate that effect.

00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:12.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The crop circles have
consequently shown the way

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for a new method of increasing
the growth rate in crops,

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:19.318 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
independent of environmentally
dangerous chemicals,

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:22.654 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
just by giving the crop seeds a
short, controlled dose of

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:25.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
electrical pulses before sowing.

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The method is being tried out
now in the USA and is,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to say at least,
extremely interesting.

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:35.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So that an electromagnetic field
of some sort or another is part

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:38.771 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the crop circle phenomenon
seems to be quite possible.

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Remains of the electromagnetic
field can quite often

00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:45.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
be registered by using different
types of equipment on site.

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:49.615 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;On a few occasions, on what
we considered to be

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:53.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a genuine formation, the meter
has started off normal

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:57.423 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
at background level, cosmic
radiation from the heavens,

00:25:57.423 --> 00:26:01.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and all of a sudden it shot up
to 10-15 times.

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:04.797 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We went in there, David was
still there with the meter,

00:26:04.797 --> 00:26:07.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it's just normal background,
about .5, was it

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:10.736 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
something like that? And then
all of a sudden, it shot up,

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:14.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and went up to 10 to 12,
which is maybe 20 times

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
normal background radiation.

00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:20.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we then thought we would
walk outside the formation and

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:23.949 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
see if the reading would alter.

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:28.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we got about 15 paces
or so perhaps, and the meter

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:33.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
dropped right back to .5,
which was normal background.

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:37.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
People with all sorts of
instrumentation come into fields

00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:40.566 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and find battery drains,
cameras sometimes don't work,

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:45.537 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
films go off,
video cameras stop running.

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:48.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Every year I bring my camera
here, and every year

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.376 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I get it fixed.
Cannon are getting fed up.

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:54.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And it's working
outside the crop circle,

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:57.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I bring it into the crop circle,
tapes jam, total...

00:26:57.583 --> 00:27:00.252 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it's a write off.
This is trying to tell me

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:04.656 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
something about some kind of
event definitely going on here.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Whatever is happening, or
whatever is making these things,

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:09.695 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
man or beast or whatever,
something is affecting,

00:27:09.695 --> 00:27:12.631 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
there's a signal, something's
trying to tell us something,

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that there's... hello,  
knocking on the door,

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:15.868 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
knocking on the
head.

00:27:15.868 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Something's going on here.
It needs investigation.

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:22.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We need to pay careful attention
to what's going on.

00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:24.009 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
And be careful.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;Several other methods
are also used to examine

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:36.054 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the effects of this phenomenon.

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:43.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;And suddenly it dawned on me
that maybe if I buried water,

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:48.433 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as soon as possible after a
formation had appeared,

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:52.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
if I buried them about
two inches deep,

00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they were only little 25 ml
bottles of water.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.876 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Research by burying small
bottles of water for a period

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:01.213 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of ten days gave very
interesting results.

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:03.916 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Frequency analyzers showed the
water samples had altered their

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:06.718 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
frequency pattern differently
from the control samples

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:09.655 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
outside the circles.
Furthermore, the bacteria

00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:12.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
content was much higher within
the formation.

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.194 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A third analyser's method
showed that the water had

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:20.399 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
increased its ability in
so-called molecular memory.

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:23.001 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;So here we are with
three different techniques,

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:26.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all showing that something
anomalous was happening

00:28:26.972 --> 00:28:30.776 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to the water buried inside.

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:34.846 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I'm perfectly certain this
phenomenon is a beneficial one,

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:38.183 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it's not malevolent. But the
energies that we're dealing

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:41.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with, we're dealing with a set
of very complex, subtle energies

00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:46.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which interact in a personal way
with our own metabolisms.

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:49.227 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
People have these wonderful
events, and they come back

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.864 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and they're sort of radiant
people. And this is lovely.

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:56.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I have to say, and I do have
to emphasize this quite

00:28:56.602 --> 00:28:58.937 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
strongly, that
not everybody feels well.

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If they feel ill,
come out very quickly.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If anybody is pregnant,
or thinking of becoming pregnant

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I say don't go in, because
we don't know really

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
what we're dealing with.

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:13.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And, most emphatically,
if anybody's got a health device

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:18.023 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is geared by a battery,
for goodness sakes don't go in.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
We've had

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.394 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
too many electrical failures,
dramatic electrical failures.

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:25.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Sometimes I've been flying
over a formation, and

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:30.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the instruments in the plane
have gone all haywire,

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:32.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and my camera refuses to work.

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:37.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That's when I've got the most
perfect shot. It won't work! Ah!

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But again, another thing we're
doing is measuring the protein

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:48.787 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
content of seeds taken from
inside as opposed to outside.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:52.891 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And what we found last year
was that we're getting

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:57.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a 50 percent increase in the
protein level from inside.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:00.599 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Maybe this can be connected
to the increased growth rate

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:04.403 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that was shown in the crop
seeds. But it also seems that

00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:07.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
human hormones can be influenced
within the crop circles, too.

00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:12.878 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Certain people, the thyroid
was most affected of all.

00:30:12.878 --> 00:30:18.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
One woman had a 40 percent
decrease in her thyroid level.

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:22.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And yet here we were
in a time scale of

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
between two and two and a half
hours, and a 40 percent drop.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So what the hell was going on?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:39.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And this again shows us that,
in terms of scientific research,

00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:40.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
with which we are finding things

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
existing inside the formations
which don't exist outside.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.646 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;I have to say that
that phenomenon that occurred

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:51.083 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
just now, when I couldn't turn
my digital camera on

00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:55.821 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
standing inside the circle,
was impressive.

00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:57.723 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I believe in energy forces.

00:30:57.723 --> 00:31:01.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I believe that there may be very
high energy here which

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.062 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
could interfere with
electrical equipment.

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:06.098 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;It just seems like it's

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:08.867 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
some sort of energy that's
some sort of frequency that's

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
different, but that it's a
frequency that's affecting

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:15.707 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
our skin and maybe even
the blood flow, because

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:19.111 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we're having these little white
things show in the skin

00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:21.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that don't usually show there.

00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.915 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So there's something
we don't know what it is, but

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
it's something different
that's radiating here

00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:27.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
from these plants.

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[Foreign language]

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;Well, you know what
it was like last year,

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:18.603 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
when it was absolutely trashed,
wasn't it?

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;A new crop circle has been
discovered, and the excitement

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.709 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
as usual is high.

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:27.212 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Is it genuine?
And what are the patterns like?

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:30.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
What about the geometry?

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And not at least, what sort of
traces will we find here?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.989 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;In some crop formations
you go in, and over

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the entirety of the whole
formation if you look,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
if you bend down and you examine
the crop in detail you'll find

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:50.535 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it's bent at the base, and then
all along the rest of the stem

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:52.838 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
there's no damage.
It's just pristine,

00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:55.674 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
there's no marks nor creases.

00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:57.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now we've got to be
very, very careful because

00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:59.678 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
it's been here all day and
we're not the first people

00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:01.613 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that have walked into it.

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:04.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So people walking around are
going to have added damage,

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:07.652 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so what we might see as damage,
we might think is from

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:11.423 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the first cause, but in actual
fact has been done by visitors.

00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:17.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I must say this is
less damage than I've seen

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:22.234 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in some formations,
but it is there.

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:26.004 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Visible breaks on some of the
crop stems can indicate that

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
something physical has been used
to flatten the crop.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Or are these

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
traces of other visitors
who have been here before us?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We can't find
any immediate signs of

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
stretched nodes
or expansion cavities either,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so again,
what or who is behind this one

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
must remain another mystery.

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt;Seventeen-two.

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.131 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;I think something like that. 

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:54.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
This is laid crop,

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and then it has a ring
around the outside as well.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;However, measuring the pattern
shows that

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:03.041 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it's approximately
200 feet in diameter.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's a very clear geometric
pattern, but only when it's seen

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:09.281 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
from the air can we determine
what it actually looks like.

00:34:15.287 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The geometry of the crop circles
has remained an integral part

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.660 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
of the studies for a long time.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.795 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Some people have gone so far as
to suggest that there is

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:26.865 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
some sort of hidden code or
message here.

00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:30.302 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Others see the geometry as just
an aesthetic expression.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Mathematical fractals 
can only be made

00:34:33.772 --> 00:34:36.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
with the help of
a computer.

00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:39.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So how can they be created
in a crop field?

00:34:49.321 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This appeared in
the middle of the day

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and in under half an hour,
without anyone in sight.

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:59.097 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Pilots who crossed the area
with tourists confirmed this.

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:03.635 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Where do all these
original designs come from,

00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:07.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that no one lays claim to?

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:10.675 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Are they crossovers
from another dimension?

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:14.045 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Do the symbols represent a kind
of communication initiative?

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:18.483 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Is this part of our evolving
knowledge of reality?

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:21.152 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;The crop circles 
are coming down

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:28.626 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
as shape, as form, 
as design.

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:33.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And I believe these shapes

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
are touching something
very deep within us.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:44.909 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And these shapes are the
language --

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:51.249 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the conversation
has been opening, you know.

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:58.723 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I think the intelligence behind
the crop circles has decided,

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:04.996 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
with great wisdom,
that this conversation,

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:10.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which has a long program
and a long agenda,

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:14.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is best established with form.

00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:28.513 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;Symbols are about

00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:31.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
understanding what kind of
world we live in.

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:35.854 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And it explains, it transmits
the understanding of

00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:39.324 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how the universe works, and the
kinds of laws we are under.

00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:43.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And this is actually
a spiritual teaching.

00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:47.165 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mathematics will go into it
and will try to explain it from

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:50.835 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a point of view of matter, the
effect of that on the physical.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:55.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The ancient knowledge is talking
about principles and concepts

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:58.243 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
behind the physical, you see.

00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:02.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So to reach that level of
understanding you have to

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:06.818 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
go above the physical.
You have to raise your mind

00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:12.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
above the... what you can see,
touch, feel, taste and so on.

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:14.726 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You have to rise above the
physical. And in that sense you

00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:21.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
are learning, you are
growing in understanding.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:23.801 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The ancient expression
growing in understanding,

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that's exactly that.
You are growing understanding!

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:29.541 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Whereas if you
bring everything down to,

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:32.177 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Aww, it's not laid properly,
Ooo, it's not quite straight,

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:34.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
you bring everything down.

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:36.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You don't look at the symbol,
you just look at the physical.

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:39.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You bring it down to your own
level of what should be right,

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:43.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and what should fit your idea,
you know.

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:47.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But this is a chance, now,
we have to really begin to

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:48.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
see the big picture.

00:38:51.029 --> 00:38:53.665 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;It's striking that
the basic geometrical forms

00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:57.168 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
such as circles, squares,
triangles, pentagrams, etc,

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
seem to create the basis
for the construction in most

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:03.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the patterns in crop circles.

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.977 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The principle of the Golden
Section and the ratio pi

00:39:05.977 --> 00:39:09.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
is often repeated
in the constructions.

00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Is it the geometry
that is the key

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in understanding the phenomenon,
or is it the phenomenon that is

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:18.489 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the key in understanding a
deeper meaning in the geometry?

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There have been several
sensational discoveries

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that in fact point
in that direction.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.698 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;There's a couple of solutions
which are not only

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
astonishingly accurate, as they
are astonishingly simple,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that I'm just amazed that no one
in the 2,000-odd years of

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:38.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
people studying this problem
haven't discovered before.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I mean, it's
breathtakingly simple.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.447 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt;The solutions that
Allan Brown had found

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:44.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
are tied to a known
geometrical problem that

00:39:44.182 --> 00:39:47.885 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
mathematicians have struggled
with for over 2,000 years.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:50.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The act of squaring the circle
with compass and ruler,

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:54.125 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which involves creating
a square and a circle

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.828 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
whose perimeters are equal.

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This in fact is
impossible to achieve

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.499 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with 100 percent accuracy
due to the impossibility

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:04.168 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of constructing
the irrational number, pi,

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:07.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
which again is used to calculate
the circle's circumference.

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:10.475 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There are known methods
on how to get quite close

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:13.177 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to a solution, but new
principles for doing this

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:16.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with an accuracy only limited to
the thickness of the pencil line

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:19.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
was revealed in a crop circle.

00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In 1997 Michael Glickman
discovered that one of the

00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:26.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
circles that year contained some
very special proportions.

00:40:26.858 --> 00:40:32.697 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;What Michael Glickman noticed
about that formation was that

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:36.868 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if you connected up the centers
of the four satellite circles

00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:40.838 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and drew a square, then
that square would be

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:44.575 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in exactly the squared circle
proportions as to this circle,

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:47.745 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is represented by
the mother circle.

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:52.684 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So this formation encoded
a squared circle.

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:55.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;Allan now began to look
at crop circles throughout

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:59.123 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the past 25 years
that seemed to have

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the same common proportions.

00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:02.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Simple formations
with four satellite circles

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:05.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
around a center--
so-called quintuplets.

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:08.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
He understood that
these demonstrated

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:10.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the same principle of
squaring the circle.

00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:12.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;What I found was
that the fact that

00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:15.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they so comprehensively did it
right the way from like

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:17.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the first one I studied in 1983,
right the way to

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:22.947 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the last one I studied in 2002,
was that the same notion of the

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
squaring of the circle was being
demonstrated in all that body of

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.653 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
formations over a 25 year span.

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:31.522 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On closer studies of these
circles, he suddenly discovered

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
new simple and elegant
construction methods

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:36.761 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
regarding this problem that
had never been seen before.

00:41:36.761 --> 00:41:40.631 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Is it possible that something
such as that can suddenly

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:43.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
appear by chance in
a field of flattened corn?

00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:46.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;This is just taking the most
simple, simple geometry

00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:50.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that even a school kid can
learn, and recombining it

00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:53.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in an incredibly simple way,
which then allows

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:58.583 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
solutions to just drop out, drop
out of the hat, as it were.

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:03.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I mean, and again I find
that that is to me

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.256 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
an indicator of intelligence.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:09.694 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's not going deeper into
complexity, it's taking the

00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:14.132 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
simplest component parts, and
recombining them in a way which

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:17.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we'd just never thought to do.
It's so simple.

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:20.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;These new methods connected to
squaring the circle use

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:21.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
three basic elements

00:42:21.806 --> 00:42:25.643 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that symbolize the Earth, human
beings, and the wholeness.

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:28.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Is a spiritual message
hidden here?

00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Is this an encouragement
to the human race to

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:33.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
seek a new understanding
in connection with

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
our relationship to Earth
and the wholeness?

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:39.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Strangely enough, this also
relates to the difference in

00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
size between the Earth's and the
moon's radii.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;You can run a circle through
the center of the moon,

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
which then squares the circle.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;And maybe even more remarkable
is that the same principle

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.707 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is again noticed in Stonehenge,
in relation to the distance

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:59.677 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
between the inner and outer
stone circles.

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:04.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Did man, some 5,000 years ago,
know something that we don't,

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:10.054 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
or have forgotten? Or is this
again just another coincidence?

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:12.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And when one takes

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:14.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the Earth's diameter and the
Earth plus moon's radius in

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:17.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
English miles,
so correspondingly it relates to

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:21.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the same figures in feet and
decimals as to Stonehenge.

00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
These figures, 5040 and 7920,
are keys to that

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
basic and traditional
formulation of number

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:31.142 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that lay on the root
of all ancient culture.

00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:35.613 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
5040 is the first seven numbers
multiplied together.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:40.218 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
7920 appears by multiplying
the next four.

00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:43.087 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Greek philosopher Plato
describes these numbers as

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:47.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the key symbols of
the divinely ordered creation.

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so, another
crop circle appears where

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the amount of standing and
flattened elements

00:43:54.232 --> 00:43:58.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
also show to be the same figures
in a scale of one to ten.

00:43:58.903 --> 00:44:02.373 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Its construction is
of the most advanced geometry

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:05.142 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
consisting of 144 circles
around a circle.

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:09.714 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Challenging enough to construct
on paper, but in the middle of

00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
a crop field at night,
and even without touching

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the center of the pattern.

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:17.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This remarkable formation
only lasting a few hours

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.690 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
before the harvest is moved in,

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:23.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not only in total clarity
symbolizes the DNA spiral, but

00:44:23.194 --> 00:44:25.796 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
also the squaring of the circle,
and the relationship between the

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:30.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Earth and the moon
by divine numbers.

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:34.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And to add it all up, the sum of
these two numbers is 1296,

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which again is six
times six times six times six.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.446 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the ancient Greek alphabet
these numbers correlate

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to letters spelling out a name.
That name is

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
goddess of all creation.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.327 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;To me, even now, after having
lived with this diagram

00:44:56.327 --> 00:44:59.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for two years, my hair stands on
end, I've got goosebumps

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:04.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because, you know as a designer,
if someone came to me and said

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
look, I want you to design a
picture which has got

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:10.942 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
792 elements somehow, and
504 elements.

00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:15.146 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
See if you can come up with
something interesting.

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:17.248 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
To come up with that,

00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:21.586 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a perfect rotating DNA spiral
encoding those numbers,

00:45:21.586 --> 00:45:24.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is in itself a work of genius.

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But then to find that in a wheat
field in August,

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
there, beautifully formed.

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:35.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And it seems to me the most sane
way of dealing with it is

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to accept that this is
a demonstration of

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:42.239 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a level of intelligence and
compassion towards us,

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.975 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
which is pulling us up.

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:48.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We have to look at this square
in the face and I think it's

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:54.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a truly extraordinary bit of
intelligence and geometry.

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:57.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;Again, new seasons bring new
crop circles with fresh,

00:45:57.955 --> 00:46:02.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
original designs, and new,
exciting geometry.

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:05.296 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
A circle divided into 13 parts.

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:09.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Or divided into 7,11, and 13
parts,

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.537 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in addition to a row of new
fantasy field patterns.

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:16.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Many of these are pure logos
that advertising agencies

00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.844 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
would demand a great deal of
money to develop.

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:22.613 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Here we can pick and choose
for free.

00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:41.699 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;How it was made is not that
important I think, you know.

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:48.239 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These are, these symbols are
messages, or means of

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:50.741 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
communication to the human race

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.877 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
from some other
living creatures.

00:46:56.047 --> 00:46:58.182 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;The theory of this not being
manmade is backed up

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:00.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by the fact that more and more
people have been seeing

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
strange lights and glowing
objects in connection with

00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
the crop circles.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.292 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Inhabitants in Wiltshire have,
through ages, reported

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
strange light phenomena.

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Maybe is it not so strange
that one of the hills

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in the area was named

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.069 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Golden Ball Hill.

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:22.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
During the last few years,
these balls have also been

00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:25.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
filmed on several occasions.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.928 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
The balls of light seem to have

00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:46.297 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
some sort of connection
with the crop circles.

00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:49.667 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They have often been seen to be
moving within the formations,

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
directly over them,
or away from them.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They appear to be of soccer ball
size, and have often been

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
described as having an
impressive acceleration.

00:48:00.478 --> 00:48:03.714 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Are these some sort of
intelligent energy balls,

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:06.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or remote controlled
supernatural robots?

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:11.021 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Or maybe they are the mythical
elves that we have heard about.

00:48:12.857 --> 00:48:14.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;Those balls of light

00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:16.727 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you cannot help... there's no
way you can do that.

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:19.897 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They fly around during daytime,
they're not high up in the sky

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:22.299 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but they are over fields
with hills in the background.

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:24.235 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:43%
They are filmed
on many occasions

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.603 align:middle line:74% position:48% size:43%
by many
different people.

00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:28.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt;Have you seen
any of these yourself?

00:48:28.139 --> 00:48:30.808 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;I've once seen an amber

00:48:30.808 --> 00:48:35.346 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
ball of light at nighttime
that was pretty impressive.

00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:38.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I saw it for several minutes and
it just floated over a field,

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.819 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and it looked like an
open fireplace.

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:44.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It would get bigger and smaller.
I had good binoculars.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:48.159 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I could see it was circular
but it was not like

00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:51.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a flashlight or something. And
it made a deep impression on me.

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:54.598 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It happened in '97, and
my life has not been the same

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.167 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
any more since that time.

00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.637 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;During the filming of
these balls of light,

00:48:59.637 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a military helicopter showed up
and clearly seemed to be

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.842 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
chasing the phenomenon.

00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:07.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's not so unusual that the
military in this area are on the

00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:11.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
spot when light phenomena are
observed or crop circles appear.

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:13.617 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
But the military, at present,

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
refused to make
any comments about it.

00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;They're so often seen, filmed,
photographed, whatever,

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
over and around
the crop circles.

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And they do this in broad
daylight, you know,

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.598 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the night, whenever.

00:49:27.598 --> 00:49:30.167 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Officially though, the crop
circles are all one big joke.

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.937 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"Let's all go back to sleep,
there's nothing to see."

00:49:32.937 --> 00:49:35.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And, um, if that's the case,
why are they deploying such

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:40.711 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
high technology and helicopters
and personnel to look at

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:43.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
this situation? It doesn't
make sense, so clearly

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:46.584 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they know that we know,
that they know that

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:48.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
something is going on.

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:51.055 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;And I know last year there was
lots of helicopters

00:49:51.055 --> 00:49:54.058 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
flying very low after these
orbs of light around here,

00:49:54.058 --> 00:49:56.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
so a lot of people are getting
complaints about it,

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because the helicopters
were following some

00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:01.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
invisible light forms
doing something.

00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:03.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They were definitely
meaning business.

00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:05.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I think there's
something involved here

00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:09.874 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which is playing with
our peripheral consciousness,

00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:12.276 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and if something's playing with
your peripheral consciousness

00:50:12.276 --> 00:50:14.678 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and your peripheral perception,

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:17.147 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that could be a good thing,
or it could be a bad thing.

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:19.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think things... People need to
be on their guard when

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.152 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they have their wonder open up.
When you're wondering

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.989 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
about things, you might
let something else in.

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:28.125 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I think we need to be careful
about what's going on here.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:32.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I think it's wonderful
and it's great, but...

00:50:32.263 --> 00:50:35.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think we need to be on our
guard with what's happening.

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:37.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
With our consciousness here.

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:41.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Several instances have been
recorded whereby people have had

00:50:41.005 --> 00:50:43.707 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
close contact with
these balls of light.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;I arrived to spend the night
in this circle about 10 o'clock

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:52.516 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
PM, in the night.
My partner and a friend of ours

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:54.952 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
were sitting on the hill behind
us at Milk Hill.

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:59.523 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Around about midnight
it was very clear.

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:03.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The sky was absolutely
very clear, um, quite crisp.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:08.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And from out of the blue, out of
nowhere right in front of me,

00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:12.036 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
maybe 10 meters out in front of
me, a ball of light

00:51:12.036 --> 00:51:18.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
about soccer ball size appeared,
just appeared out of nothing,

00:51:18.042 --> 00:51:22.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
hovering just above the ground
and behind a standing tuft of

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:25.849 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
rapeseed stems at the center of
the circle.

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:29.620 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So I was kind of observing this
light through the stems and

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it was kind of putting them into
silhouette.

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:35.159 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It hovered exactly
in the same position

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
for at least 30 or 40 seconds,
long enough for me to get up,

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:44.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
move my position and look around
the actual standing tuft and

00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:46.670 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to actually see
this ball of light.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.139 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There's no doubt at all
it was certainly there,

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.275 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and it appeared from nowhere,
and it stayed there

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:56.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
for a maximum of about 1 minute?
Maybe one and a half minutes?

00:51:56.213 --> 00:52:00.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And after this amount of time
it faded, and kind of just faded

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:04.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to nothing over
the course of a few seconds.

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:07.291 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Extremely strange
and very close, but I did not

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:08.826 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
perceive any interaction.

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:11.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was like
an observer's experience only.

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:15.032 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I was left sitting there
rather bemused, with my camera

00:52:15.032 --> 00:52:19.036 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
right on my lap, which
I didn't use for some reason,

00:52:19.036 --> 00:52:22.639 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I immediately fell asleep
and woke up at 8 o clock

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:24.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the morning.
Fairly good night's sleep.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.877 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And my partner arrives
in the formation and tells me

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:30.481 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that they have seen effectively
the same thing which I saw.

00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:31.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But they saw it from
their vantage point

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:36.487 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
200 meters behind me,
and elevated probably 100 feet.

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And they saw the same thing --

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:39.957 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
what appeared to be
the same thing.

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:41.992 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They come into the field,
into the circle, and then

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.561 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they lost it. And as they lost
it, I got it, and

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:49.099 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it tied together very well, you
know. It seemed to...

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:51.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it provided, for me, independent
confirmation. Because I did

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:54.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
wake up thinking, wow was that a
dream or something?

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:59.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But it was pretty much confirmed
and it was extremely close.

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:02.846 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Close enough to be absolutely
certain that that was

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
something extremely strange in
there with me, and

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:11.155 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it wasn't anything that I've
ever seen before. That close.

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;From this height,
Oliver's Castle, one of the most

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
often debated observations was
made early one morning in 1996.

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:26.537 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A young man spending the night
here with his video camera was,

00:53:26.537 --> 00:53:27.971 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
in the early dawn, suddenly

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:30.774 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
aware of something strange
unfolding down in the field.

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt;Here I am standing
at Oliver's Castle

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:39.216 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at precisely the same spot as
John Weyleigh was standing in

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:43.754 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
August 1996 when he supposedly,
for the fist time in history

00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:47.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
managed to film
the creation of a crop circle.

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:11.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;That the crop circle was not
here the previous day

00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:14.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but had appeared the following
morning was a fact.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:17.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That John Weyleigh was here at
dawn can be confirmed by a

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:20.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
military patrol jogging by
at that time.

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:23.727 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
John returned to the local pub
later that same day and

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:27.064 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
played this remarkable footage
from his camera.

00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:29.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even so, many believed that he
had managed to manipulate the

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
film with computer animation
during this short time span,

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:36.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
something that computer
animation experts doubt.

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:40.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
To overlay a perfect animation
over a handheld, unstable film

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:43.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
would need several days of
computer work using the

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.782 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
equipment of that time.

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:48.285 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Today this film
is still a great mystery.

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:51.088 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Although confessions now have
been made by people claiming

00:54:51.088 --> 00:54:54.057 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to be responsible for it as a
hoax, others believe the

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:57.728 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
hoax theories to be organized
debunking, due to the fact that

00:54:57.728 --> 00:55:00.364 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
this remarkable footage would
have dangerous effect

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:06.737 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
on the public if declared real.

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:10.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Anyway, the repeatedly seen and
filmed balls of light are indeed

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.209 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
difficult to explain as

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:16.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
birds, flying plastic bags,
computer animation, or whatever.

00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:20.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, are they signs of life
existing parallel to ours,

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.119 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
but in another dimension?

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:25.489 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And are they responsible for
all the genuine crop circles?

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:27.658 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Speculation continues to grow

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:31.662 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in size the more
one studies the phenomenon.

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:42.272 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;I personally am convinced
that the vast majority of

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:44.841 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
crop formations are
not made by people.

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:49.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They're made by
some unexplained agency,

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:54.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
whether it be extraterrestrial
or inter-dimensional

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:57.788 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
or from the earth, or whatever.

00:55:57.788 --> 00:56:01.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
With regard to the lights, there
have been so many instances

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.627 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
where the lights have been seen

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:06.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
either before crop formations
appear, or over crop formations.

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:09.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Again, I think
there's a connection between

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the lights and the crop circles.
Certainly.

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:19.943 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;Again, I'm in a fresh and
newly appeared crop circle,

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:24.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and I must admit
the feeling is quite stunning.

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:27.351 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It's easy to see why people
are attracted by this.

00:56:27.351 --> 00:56:28.819 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
But what I don't understand

00:56:28.819 --> 00:56:31.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is why the media don't seem to
be attracted at all.

00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;They don't like questions
which can't easily be answered.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.530 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So the media have only really
liked this when we get to

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:44.167 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the question of hoaxing and
of people making it --

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:47.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Doug and Dave, and all that.
Which is a nice, neat thing.

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:51.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It wraps it up in a parcel, we
can put it away, that's that

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:54.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
solved and finished, now let's
get back to the football.

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:59.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You know? And so, really, the
media don't want to do this one.

00:56:59.016 --> 00:57:01.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Even people like the BBC don't
want to do this one because

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's a big question,
and it concerns

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.191 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the future of civilization.

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt;We believe that
the formations are

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:15.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
tangible evidence,
aren't they? that the... 

00:57:15.399 --> 00:57:17.934 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
that we're not alone.

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:22.539 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And our government and other
governments have for years been

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:27.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
trying to tell us that
we are alone, and ridiculing

00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:31.815 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
all the people who've
seen craft and had experiences.

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I think they're frightened
to death of the fact that

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:38.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
here we have fantastic evidence,
and they're

00:57:38.255 --> 00:57:43.927 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
doing their best to tell us
that "they're all hoaxes".

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:46.830 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Even the newspapers in this
country are... seem to be

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:51.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in on it, you know. They...
It amazes me that reporters,

00:57:51.702 --> 00:57:54.671 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
journalists have
under their noses

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:59.776 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
one of the most fantastic
stories ever, and yet

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:02.979 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they completely dismiss it
out of hand. It's as if they're

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:05.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
frightened to get involved
with it somehow.

00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:10.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Would you like to be the news
editor who published a headline,

00:58:10.354 --> 00:58:16.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
"Everything We Believe In Is Now
Destroyed"? I don't think so.

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:22.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So, the newspapers, the media,
are very good at, um...

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:30.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and a little joke at the end.
"O, little green men from Mars".

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:34.611 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;But in 2001, suddenly the
media paid some interest,

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:37.748 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because then something appeared
that was almost impossible

00:58:37.748 --> 00:58:40.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to overlook. Right behind me
is Britain's largest

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:45.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
radio telescope, the
Chilbolton Observatory.

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:47.858 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And here it was that the
greatest sensation in the

00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:50.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
crop circle history was to
appear in the fields

00:58:50.494 --> 00:58:54.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
right in front of the telescope.

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:58.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
On the morning of 14th of August
2001, a formation was discovered

00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:02.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which was different from any
other previously seen.

00:59:02.506 --> 00:59:04.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
From the ground,
it looked like a tangled mess.

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:09.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Wisps of crop spread around in
no system. However,

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:13.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in the evening with growing
shadows, a picture appeared --

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:19.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
unmistakably that of a face.
That picture represented

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a whole new technique --
a screen technique.

00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:25.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The same that's used for
printing a picture on paper.

00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:28.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Three days later, the face
was joined by something

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:33.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that looked like a data strip:
Rows of counters made out of

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:35.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
standing and flattened crop.

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:40.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But soon, an astonishing
similarity was discovered.

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:42.579 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
In 1974, the astronomer

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:46.383 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Carl Sagan composed a message
that NASA sent into space

00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:49.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from the Arecibo telescope
in Puerto Rico.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Binary figures which constituted
a graphic code presenting

00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
key factors about humans
and the planet we live on.

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.664 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
27 years later an identical
pattern appears in a crop field

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:03.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
right in front of
a similar radio telescope.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
However, on closer inspection,
it seemed to show that

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:09.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the code contained some
fundamental differences.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:13.310 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Sagan's message explained
our calculation system,

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the dominant chemical substances
within the elements that

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:20.750 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
create life on Earth, about our
DNA code, humans' height and

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
quantity, and that we live
on the third planet in our

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
solar system. And lastly, a
sketch of our radio telescope.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:33.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The message received describes
the same calculation system, but

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that silicon is
most dominant in lifeforms

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in contrast to carbon.
The drawing also clearly shows

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.508 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a humanoid figure, with large
head in relation to its body.

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:46.209 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It's also explained
that they have

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.212 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
an extra string in their DNA,
are approximately four feet

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:53.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
tall, and inhabit the third,
forth and fifth planets in their

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:59.155 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
solar system, and have a
population of 221.3 billion.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.957 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Underneath, the telescope
has been replaced by

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.260 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
something more complex.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.697 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
One year earlier,

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.799 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a strange crop circle
had appeared in the same place.

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:12.903 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Is this the same illustration
as in the sender's code?

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:17.807 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Is this the correspondent's
radio telescope?

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.714 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If this is not an extremely
clever and well calculated joke

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.284 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
conducted by humans,
is it a serious response from

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:30.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
an alien civilization?

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:34.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;The Chilbolton crop formations
really gave new life to

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.426 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the speculations of
who is behind this.

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:39.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Is it aliens?
Where do they come from?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:44.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And what is their purpose of
this type of communication?

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:47.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt;The following year, very
nearly on the same day,

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:51.341 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a new picture appeared that gave
new force to the alien theory,

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:56.112 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this time in Crabwood, near the
town of Winchester in Hampshire.

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Once again we see a face,
but this time there is

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
an unmistakable resemblance to
something extraterrestrial.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.689 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The picture also contains a
print, somewhat similar

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.792 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to that of a CD, with something
that appears to be

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
a coded message.

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:16.232 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This formation also has
a new type of design, this time

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:20.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with horizontal line patterns of
variable thickness, similar to

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:22.706 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
that of a TV picture.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:25.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The message on the disk is
similar to a spiral band

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.743 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
built up of many boxes.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.213 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But data expert Paul Vigay
managed to decipher the message.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:34.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt;I've had to enlarge the disk

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:36.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
quite substantially
on the computer and run some

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:39.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
image analysis over it to make
it clear, so that I could see

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what was a standing tuft
and what was flattened.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.794 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And while I was doing this, I
noticed that every so often

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:48.565 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there was almost a mistake
in the diagram.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.266 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It was like there was a tuft,

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:54.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a rather little square tuft,
done sort of half size.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:57.841 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I thought, that's a bit odd.
And it seemed fairly regular.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:02.045 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I was going round, and I sort of
counted up, and it was sort of

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:03.813 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
literally every sort of
eight bytes, or whatever.

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.316 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I thought "Aw, eight bytes"
And, you know, from

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:09.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
computer science, it's obviously
some sort of binary code.

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:13.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So then I did the
straightforward thing --

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:17.627 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I just converted it into ASCII,
which is the standard sort of

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:21.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
binary computer language
that you encode the alphabet in.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:26.302 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And of course I then started to
get words forming out,

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:29.539 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and I thought "Ah-ha", you know,
"I'm getting somewhere here".

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.541 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So I then did the whole thing
for the whole lot,

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.576 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and got this message.

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:36.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt;The message is in English,
and reads as follows: 

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Many have been surprised
by this message.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.668 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Are there aliens with such faces
that we should be aware of?

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Or is this a picture
of the sender?

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:04.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Does this indicate the start
of actual close contact with

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
neighbors in the universe?

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.918 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
My own, and this is only a
hypothesis, belief about this

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:18.788 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is that there's an effort of...
the extraterrestrials are

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:25.061 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
gradually trying to communicate
with us. A very slow process

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:30.233 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
giving us a lot of time to
digest the fact that

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.001 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
we may not be alone here.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:35.839 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;I've been researching the UFO
phenomenon for longer

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:38.308 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
than the circles, and I think
there is a connection

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
between the two.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And whatever agency's involved
is obviously, i think, I know

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:50.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's a bit of a cliche now, but
it's kind of building up to some

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
kind of contact within
a short space of time.

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:58.762 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I think that these signs, there
are signs. Some of them are

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:03.066 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
warning signs, if you look over
the history of the film, and

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they work on different levels.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.804 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They work on the subliminal
level, the level of

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:11.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
consciousness, influencing
people's consciousness.

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:15.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So I think in a way they're kind
of preparing us for some kind

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:19.616 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of, possibly some kind of
contact. Maybe, a more open

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:23.186 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
contact within the next few
years. Possibly.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:30.026 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;I think this is the biggest
gift we have ever had

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:38.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
on the planet. I think it's the
most important moment we've ever

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:43.306 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
had on the planet.
I think it brings us 

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:49.979 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
nothing but good.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:58.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I think we should all sit calmly
and accept the future,

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:02.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
because we're in the middle of a
dimensional shift right now,

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:11.067 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I think our cousins out
there, or sisters, realize that

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:21.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the planet Earth is famously
uh... like this in the universe,

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:30.653 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we're going to be dragged
kicking and screaming into the

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:34.557 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
future, and it won't be easy.

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:40.396 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I think they are
very gently offering us help.

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:44.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;I don't know what it is. But I
know it isn't planks and boards.

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:47.837 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And I may be the only person in
the world that can say that,

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:51.574 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
coming from both the science,
and the fact that

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:54.744 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I watched one happen.
There were no planks and boards!

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:57.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You can throw that idea out.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There are people who make them,
yes. There are people -- go into

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:01.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the fields and amuse themselves.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.388 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That didn't make the one that I
saw happen, and they haven't

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:07.023 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
made these others
that we've been testing.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.525 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;Nancy Talbot is not
just one of the most well known

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:12.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
crop circle researchers
in the world, she's also

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.031 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
one of the few that claims to
have seen the phenomenon

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in action at close hand.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:20.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In 2001, she visited Robbert van
den Broecke in Holland,

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:23.339 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a young man who had also said
that he had observed the

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
creation of many crop circles.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.477 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
As she was on her way to bed on
the second floor of Robbert's

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.045 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
house, something suddenly
happened.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:34.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Seconds, minutes later,
this tube of light,

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:38.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
this brilliant, about a foot and
a half, maybe two foot diameter

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:43.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
tube of light came crashing down
right in front of those windows.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.061 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Scared the dickens out of me.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean it lit up the field
outside like daylight,

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:50.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but there wasn't really time
to do anything,

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.569 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it only lasted for
a second or so. No noise,

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:57.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
no smell, no electromagnetic
response in the skin.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:01.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Just this brilliant light,
an enormous force.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:05.181 align:middle line:74% position:44% size:78%
It stopped, it disappeared,
and, "did that really happen?",

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:08.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
You know? Before you had time to
think about it, another one.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.721 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Same place. Womp! This thing
comes down. Exactly the same.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:14.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The outside lit up like daytime,
the inside lights up.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:19.195 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And now I'm thinking,
"God, I hope Robbert's seeing

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the same thing", because you
don't want to see this sort of

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
thing all by yourself.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Before I could get on the bed,
by then I'm starting to get on

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:29.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the bed, and had
begun to yell for him,

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:31.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
a third tube came crashing down.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:34.877 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Well, by this time he's halfway
up the stairs yelling for me,

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because he's been watching
exactly the same thing

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
from downstairs.

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:41.951 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now from my vantage point the
windows, although very high,

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:45.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
cut this tube of light off
at a certain point.

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:48.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
He was right next to the windows
downstairs and could see

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:50.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
considerably farther
up in the sky.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:54.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Neither of us saw anything in
the sky from which these tubes

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.901 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of light could possibly have
come. There's nothing up there.

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:04.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We went to the windows in the
bedroom, looked up, saw nothing.

01:09:04.574 --> 01:09:07.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Went running downstairs to... we
were getting ready to go out,

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:11.447 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and... I was a little scared,
not brave, and I thought

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.683 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"If another one of
those things comes, I don't

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
want to be underneath it".

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:17.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But Robbert, he got brave,
and he stepped out, and

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.122 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
nothing happened to him, so I
grabbed the flashlight,

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:23.126 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and we went right to the fence
which is about 85-90 feet

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:27.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
behind the house, and there in
that field right on the other

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:32.935 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
side of that fence, and I think
I saw steam. I'm not positive,

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I couldn't really tell because I
was holding the flashlight,

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:38.608 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
but I think I saw steam rising.
And there was

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a brand new crop circle.
And it wasn't just a circle.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It was an ellipse, as a matter
of fact, a very distinct

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:48.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
ellipse, with a long pathway
going off on the northern end,

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and a crossbar.
Like a capital letter T.

01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:54.257 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And Robbert and I just...
it wasn't there earlier, we'd

01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:58.294 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
been right there earlier in the
evening, and there it was.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:00.963 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;Nancy and Robbert's experience
can only be confirmed by

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.833 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
themselves, even though it was
clear that there was a pattern

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:06.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the field of sweet peas
the day after.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:09.739 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Were they really witnesses to
the phenomenon that creates all

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:13.709 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the genuine crop circles, or was
it just one of many variations

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the phenomenon?
Are there many different

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:20.283 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
players of both normal and
paranormal origin in the fields?

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:25.288 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Now, you've got to remember
also that there are so-called

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
manmade designs out there.

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:31.260 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But at the same point in time
I've come across them where

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've gone in a few hours after
they've arrived, and I find

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
additions. And I've looked at
it, and then I've spoken to some

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:41.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of them afterwards. They claim
that they did it, and I say OK,

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:45.108 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
fine, let's see the evidence.
And they produce all sorts of

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:47.977 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
evidence, and then I'll say OK,
well what about this bit?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
They'll say, Oh,
we didn't do that bit. I'll say,

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.015 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if you didn't do it, who did?
They say, we don't know.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But it's human arrogance
to think that

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.953 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we're the only intelligent
life forms in the universe.

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:59.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
There are others out there
that have abilities way beyond

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:02.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
what we're capable of doing.
Now, just because

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:07.864 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we can't see it, doesn't mean
to say it isn't there.

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:19.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;Well, you sit out here
in this field, you know,

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:22.645 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
especially for a night maybe,
spend a whole night

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.148 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in this circle, in this
geometric pattern which

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:28.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
at this time is a complete
mystery, you can sit here

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.453 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and you can ask your own
fundamental questions,

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:34.090 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and there's no need for
TV, culture, religion.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:38.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You know it's like a personal
little church for a night and,

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you know, it's actually very
healthy, and it certainly should

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.334 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
be looked at very seriously
before being ridiculed.

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:46.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Usually the ridicule

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:49.472 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is stemming from fear
rather than known fact.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.974 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt;Personally, I think the

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.977 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
message of the crop circles
is really important,

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.380 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I think they are one of the
most important things

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.981 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
happening on the planet
at the moment.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.551 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I think they speak of
Earth changes.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:05.888 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think they speak about
changes in human evolution.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:08.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I think we're being stimulated
and pulled forward to consider

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
all kinds of possibilities
for the fact that

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:14.096 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the reality which we perceive
at the moment is not in fact

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the entire reality at all.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:20.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt;It is entirely our free choice
to give attention

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
to these things.

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:24.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If they wanted to interfere,
they would knock out our

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.643 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
computers and our electronics,
and things like that to really

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
give us a shock. You know.
But they're not. They're doing

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:34.150 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it in the middle of fields, and
it is entirely our choice

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:38.087 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to give these things attention.
And even when that's the case,

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they're not giving any really
clear answers. They're saying,

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:46.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
"Form your own conclusions."
"What are your ideas on this?"

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.531 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
"How do you respond to this?"

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:51.033 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so they're not interfering,
they're more like

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:55.871 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
very enlightened grownups
working with kids.

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:58.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And, you know, when
you're teaching a child,

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:03.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it's best not to say,
"Don't do this" and "Do that".

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.015 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That doesn't really
educate a child.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:10.486 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's much better to give a child
educational opportunities

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:13.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
where they can become
aware of the situation

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:15.791 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and make their own choices.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.794 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And you've got to set up that
experience in a way where

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:23.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the child will figure it out
well for themselves,

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.469 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and that is a real education.

01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:27.870 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt;Each year you get
people saying

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they're all manmade,
they must be a hoax.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:34.510 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But equally, there's people who
refuse to accept that and say

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.012 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
"No, this is something that

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:38.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
must be investigated more.
It's very important."

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:44.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And so what we've found with the
crop circles is it has created

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.024 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a whole forum for debate over
the nature of reality.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:51.093 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There's been nothing like it in
modern history, and this

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:54.830 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
whole adventure about arguing
between the skeptics and the

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.366 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
believers has created this
magical space in the middle

01:13:57.366 --> 01:14:01.337 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
where we can discuss anything
about what the universe is.

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:03.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And all because of

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:05.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
these strange patterns
appearing in the fields.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:10.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But we don't actually know
where they come from.

01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:15.117 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt;One of the finest,
most beautiful and original

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
art forms of modern times.
Still totally mysterious.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:22.692 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Is this a process of
advanced communication?

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:25.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Or a course of
re-education, beginning with

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the symbols of
sacred knowledge and wisdom?

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:33.736 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;Is the truth to be found up
there? Or maybe down there.

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:39.942 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Or inside us. Or maybe
beside us in another dimension.

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Anyway, it's going to be very
interesting to see where this is

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.647 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
going to take us.

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:12.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
