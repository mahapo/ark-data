00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Consciousness.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
we all have yet remains

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the most mysterious human trait.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a quality that
every human being possesses.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We can be aware of
our own consciousness

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
during waking times, when we
are deep in contemplation,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
or even pondering the
vastness of the universe.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:84%
To better understand
what consciousness is,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
many attempts have been made
to define exactly what it is.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's that
state of wakefulness

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
when you are aware
of your surroundings.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Some say that it is
the ability to be

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
aware of something
going on within oneself.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Others say that it is a
sense of self-awareness.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
considered to be

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
valid descriptions
of consciousness.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Since time immemorial,
philosophers

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
have debated the exact
nature of consciousness

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to be a
sentient, or even sapient,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Advances in neuroscience
have given us

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
an intricate understanding of
exactly how the brain works.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
We know the regions of the
brain where memories are stored,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
where information from our
eyes and ears are formed.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We have even been able
to transmit thoughts

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
from one person to another
via advanced neurotechnology.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
However, the source or
cause of consciousness

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
continues to elude even the
most diligent of seekers.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are some who
may have found the answer.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Because everybody's
totally fixed on matter

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:10%
as the ultimate
reality, they're trying

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.639 align:middle line:10%
to explain how
consciousness could possibly

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:10%
come out of matter.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're getting nowhere.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They've got theories in
quantum physics they've tried,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
theories in
information sciences,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
chemical theories--
nothing works.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.265 align:middle line:84%
But nobody dares
question the assumption.

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:08.851 align:middle line:84%
And the assumption is that
matter is unconscious.

00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:09.809 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
If matter is unconscious,
the problem is, how on Earth

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
does consciousness,
awareness, ever arise out

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
of something that
has no awareness.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:10%
>>Matter and energy
are emanations

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:10%
of some deeper intrinsic order.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
All these seemingly separate
selves, seemingly separate

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
identities, going
about their own lives,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
living what appears to
be a separate existence--

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and yet we are all
fundamentally sharing

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the same unified consciousness
that the universe is made of.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We've now seen scientific proof
that the universe emanates

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
from a geometric seed that
doesn't have any space or time.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Since we are conscious,
consciousness

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
must be in that seed.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
All of the universe is
emanating from this.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So there is scientific
grounding to support

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
the Law of One
philosophical stance, which

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is that, in fact, there
is one infinite creator,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and the universe itself is
a living, conscious being.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Space, time, energy,
matter, and biology

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are created by a
universal consciousness.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Our idea about
subatomic particles

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:10%
are, as physics class has shown
us, little billiard balls.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what we think of.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, a subatomic
particles is not that.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrating packet of
energy, trading information

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and energy with other subatomic
particles and this background

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
energy field.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So a subatomic particle is
essentially a shape-shifter.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you look down at
matter at that tiny level, what

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
you find is there's no
such thing as a thing.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
The unit of the
universe isn't a thing.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a relationship.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the relationship between
those subatomic particles.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Scientists have been
able to detect and record

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:90%
this energy field.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But what we see as a
background energy field

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
may well be a unified field
of intelligent energy.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
This energy is more
than just intelligent.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It is omnipresent throughout
all the time and space

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and permeates
everything in existence.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>We've looked at the idea
that the gravitational field

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.445 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a fluid-like
essence of the universe

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%
that all matter arises from.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of matter,
energy, consciousness,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
All of the things that
we see in the universe,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
both physical and nonphysical,
arise from this source field.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>When you start factoring in
the whole idea of a quantum

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
energy field, then that is
a wonderful neat metaphor

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to understand
things, connections

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that occur between people, or
between people and other living

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
things, like plants, across
time and across space.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:10%
>>It is a
self-organizing universe,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.085 align:middle line:10%
and it is a
self-correcting universe.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The embryo knows how
to turn into a baby.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The acorn knows how to
turn into an oak tree.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Within nature, it is
obvious that there

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
is a natural
intelligence at work.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Marcus Aurelius, in his
writing, "The Meditations, "

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
contemplated, "For there is one
universe made up of all things,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and one god who pervades all
things, and one substance,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and one law, and one reason."

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
In a lesser-known work of
Charles Darwin, "The Formation

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of Vegetable Mould Through
the Action of Worms,"

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
he documented how far
earthworms acted consciously

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and how much mental
power they displayed.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:84%
He concluded that there
was no absolute threshold

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
between lower and
higher animals.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Even Albert Einstein
offered support

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
to this idea of a
unified consciousness

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
with all living things.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
In his 1949 work, "The
World As I See It,"

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
he calls for us to
embrace all living

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
creatures and the
whole of nature.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Whatever that original
source of consciousness

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
that has brought
everything into creation,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
visible and invisible,
we're just aspects of that.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:10%
It actually highlights how
much bigger and greater

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:10%
the creator is.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>If I realize that
I am a child of God,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just an idea in the
mind of God, then and only then

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.972 align:middle line:84%
do I get to realize that
you are the same thing.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And on that realm, there is
no separation between us.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
On that realm, there is
no competition between us.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>We're talking about a
universal consciousness, where

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
to the spirit of God

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.481 align:middle line:90%
within every living being.

00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, whether we call that
the zero-point energy field,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:10%
we call that universal
intelligence,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:10%
we call it God--
zero-point energy

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:10%
field is the new name for God.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's an ocean of
holographic records

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that houses within it the
history of every living being,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and makes the connection
possible through means

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:90%
of a quantum process.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And that quantum process
is unconditional love.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Unconditional love is
the key to understanding

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
the nature of our connection.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
While this intelligent
and creative field

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
permeates everything
in our universe,

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
its loving and creative nature
is what draws us all together

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and binds us to the
universe and each other.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:10%
>>If my energy is not coming
from love, compassion,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:10%
and forgiveness, by whatever
name I give it, then

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:10%
I am making a
world that will not

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:10%
be happy for myself--
and others, by the way.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, you've got
religious fears.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:90%
You've got skepticism.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
You've got all sorts
of walls that are there

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to stop humanity, to encraze
cosmic consciousness.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:10%
And they're all distancing
themselves from the spirit

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:10%
and from the face
and the truth of God.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's wrong.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You cannot let go
off the creator.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>We have a metaphor
of ourselves,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or an image of ourselves, as
the hero up against it all.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is about
being right, being first,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:90%
being individual.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:90%
That's been our programming.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
If we have a hard drive, it's
been programmed with "I win,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:90%
you lose."

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
against nature,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we're
in the mess we're in.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:90%
This is what selfish looks like.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
hard to understand

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:84%
how much that
definition of ourselves

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:90%
really informs how we operate.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Because not all cultures do.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They think of themselves
as being all connected.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they create a
very different kind of society.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:10%
>>You are born with
divine consciousness.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:10%
The whole point of
being on the Earth

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:10%
is to realize that and live your
life in the pursuit of justice

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and compassion, from
the profoundest peace

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and the wildest, wildest love.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
A state of joyful
interpenetrating, interrelated

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
love with all things
is already here.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It's on the Earth.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not in some other where.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point of waking
up to your divine consciousness

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is that you wake up to this
radiance of divine presence

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, in other
beings, and in yourself.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>There's another way of being,
another mode of consciousness,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that we can free ourselves
up from this attachment,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
this materiality.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we begin to become

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
more in-tune with our
world, with our environment,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:90%
We become more compassionate.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:10%
So I think the next
stage is, having realized

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:10%
that's the basic problem, is
then say, OK, what do we know?

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:10%
Just looking at the world's
spiritual traditions

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and other metaphysical
traditions,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:10%
what do we know that
can really help free

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:10%
up human consciousness?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Forging this connection with
this universal consciousness

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
available to everyone.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
However, we live in
a turbulent world

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
full of stressful lifestyles
and dramatic conflicts

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
that continuously tear us
away from this source of life

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:84%
We have literally been
programmed to remain separate

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to better serve the
needs of those in control.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
To remember where
we came from, we

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
must learn to see beyond
these manufactured illusions,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to open our hearts and minds to
the unified force binding all

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>>There is a reluctance--
and in some cases,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:10%
an outright resistance--
for the mainstream media,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:10%
mainstream academia,
classrooms, textbooks,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:10%
to share the new discoveries.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
This would be
important at any time,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
but this is especially
critical right now,

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
because we are at
this moment of crisis.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>We have made an incredible
technological advancement.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:90%
We will go on the moon.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:90%
We have GPS.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:90%
We have the internet.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
We're up here on the physical
realm of consciousness.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But in the spirit, we are
still 2,000 years ago,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in deceptive, dogmatic,
religious teaching.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:90%
The gap needs to be adjusted.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that can be accomplished
with cosmic consciousness,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.213 align:middle line:84%
where not only you, but
agreed-- the people that

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
are in power, the people that
are in charge of your life.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Once they become
cosmic conscious,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
now we are talking about a
very, very big difference.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:10%
>>Empire isn't playing a
low-consciousness game.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:10%
It's playing a
high-consciousness game.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
That means it needs our
consent to function.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Its says, I'm going to
change your reality.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And you go, yep, right.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And then it can do it.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
If you say, no, it can't touch
you, it cannot touch you.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I can do nothing.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.474 align:middle line:84%
>>This is where I
believe we are now.

00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
rise of consciousness

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is allowing us to move
rapidly towards that.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And realizing we can move
beyond the technology,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.775 align:middle line:84%
because the technology is
actually in our bodies.

00:11:45.775 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are the highest
level of technology

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
that we can imagine.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>The first thing to realize
is to take responsibility

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
for our own consciousness.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.356 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say, you know,
other people must change.

00:11:58.356 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
But we're all part of them.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of them.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
We must all change.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the only person I really
have responsibility for

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:90%
is myself.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
How do I free myself from
outdated conditioning?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Illusions are as powerful in
their effects as is the truth.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So free will is that I can
think whatever I want to think.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I can make my theme
that I'm a daughter of God,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
or I could make my
theme something else.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But to the extent to which
I make it something else,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
the vision of one world costs
you the vision of the other.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I get lost
in the story and

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.929 align:middle line:84%
in the manufactured, made-up
illusions of the world--

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to be?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What's your brand?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:90%
What're you going to do?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:90%
What's your strategy?

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
How're you going
to make it happen?

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I, by definition, am
entering into a realm

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
where I'm always
going to be seeking,

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm never going
to be finding.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Once you realize that
the whole universe is

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
an emanation of
consciousness, you

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
can dissolve your
karma by forgiveness

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and by accepting
everything in the universe

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:90%
as being purely sacred.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
of the universe

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
wants us to grow into
more than we are now.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>And that is our salvation.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we worked on that
collectively, and institutions,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
individuals,
organizations, whatever,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
made that a real focus, I
think, in a very short time,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
we could actually have
processes, techniques,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
things we could
disseminate to the public

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
which would really
encourage that awakening

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:10%
When we start living according
to the definition of who

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:10%
we really are, and start
wiping that hard drive clean,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:10%
only then will we
evolve to another level.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:10%
>>It's the rising of the
golden yeast of passionate love

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:10%
consciousness in millions
and millions of human beings

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:10%
as a response to this
appalling evolutionary crisis

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:10%
that we've created
out of our own lunacy.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And this passionate
love consciousness--

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
passionate for compassion,
passionate for harmony,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:84%
passionate for balance,
passionate for justice--

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
is rising now like a
golden yeast in millions

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
of human beings of all
kinds, all over the world.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>I just think it's
an exciting time.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
If we all understand that
message of how powerful we

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.005 align:middle line:84%
really are and start
living it-- you know,

00:14:21.005 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they'll say,
oh, well that's for them.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It can't be for me.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, it is for you.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It's for all of us.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And don't we all want to
live this most empowered life

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:90%
that we can live?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And live the life we dream?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not just
for other people.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It is for each and every
one of us, if which choose,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:90%
make the decision, to do it.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>The reality we
think we live in

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
is merely an illusion,
created and perpetuated

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:84%
by the forces who stand to gain
from you remaining separate

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
from the infinite love
and wisdom that emanates

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:90%
from the source of all creation.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you always
have the free will

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to choose to live in
this world of illusions

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
or to share in a collective
vision of light, life, love,

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and liberty that originates
beyond the confines

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
of our limited physical
time-space reality.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
To seek beyond the illusions
is to find a deeper

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
meaning of the pure
energy we call love.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It is learning to share it,
not for personal gratification

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
but for the benefits
of all sentient beings,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
