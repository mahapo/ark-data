00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Could your love of sushi be
proof that you were Japanese

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.720 align:middle line:10%
in a past life?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But for a group of
24 Burmese children,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:90%
it might just be the case.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
After World War II, a large
group of children in Burma

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:84%
claimed to have been Japanese
soldiers in a past life.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
They could not tolerate
the spicy Burmese cuisine.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Instead, they craved raw fish.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of
thousands of documented cases

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in which memories
seem to carry over

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
from past life experiences.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
reincarnation is held

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in many parts of the world,
especially those areas

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
where Hinduism and
Buddhism are practiced.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But not until recently has it
come to be a widely accepted

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:90%
idea in the Western world.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
A number of researchers
are seriously

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
exploring the evidence for
reincarnation, especially

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.863 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
past life regressions.

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It's been estimated that about
a million people have access

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to past life memories
in one way or another.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The most common method is
through a guided therapy

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
session with a psychotherapist.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
During these
sessions, the subject

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
is put under hypnosis while
a therapist guides them

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:90%
with directions and questions.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Regressions are often
cathartic, accessing

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
memories that are somehow
tied to physical afflictions

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety experienced
in the current lifetime.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the most prominent
names in past life regression

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.925 align:middle line:90%
is Dr. Brian Weiss.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
His daughter, Amy
Weiss, had never

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
had a successful regression,
despite her father's

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Amy had recently been
diagnosed with cataracts

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 25, an unusual
condition for someone her age,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and she decided to participate
in one more session.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly, Amy experienced
a successful past life

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
regression, connecting with
an old man in the Middle Ages

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
who was accused
of being a wizard.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
His house was set on
fire by villagers,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
subsequently burning his eyes.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
She said she felt a connection
with the man's heart

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and realized it could be
tied to her cataracts.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The session proved to have
profound therapeutic benefit,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and her cataracts
cleared up shortly after.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Past life regressions can
be a contentious topic

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
among practitioners
of psychology.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
The evidence and accounts
are overwhelming,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
but there's debate as
to what they really are.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.559 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ian Stevenson was a
well-respected psychologist

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and was the chair of the
Department of Psychology

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Virginia.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
He was given a $1 million
grant to fund research

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
into paranormal psychology,
also known as "parapsychology,"

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of disproving
the concept of reincarnation.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Stevenson went on to
research thousands

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
of cases on the uncanny
memories of young children

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
from their past lives.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
While his intention was to
disprove this phenomenon,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in the end, he became one
of its staunchest defenders

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
and most dedicated researchers.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
One child in India who was born
with boneless stubs for fingers

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
on his right hand remembered
the life of a farm boy

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
who had lost the fingers
on his right hand

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:90%
in a grass-chopping accident.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
What really makes
this case remarkable

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
is that Stevenson
was unable to find

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
a single medical
record of another birth

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
with this unique deformity.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Today, Dr. Jim Tucker
continues to conduct

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
the work started by Stevenson.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Unlike past life regressionists,
Dr. Stevenson and Dr. Tucker

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
do not study those
put under hypnosis.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they look
at cases of kids

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
who start to spontaneously
remember things

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and who start speaking
about their previous lives

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:90%
while fully cognizant.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:84%
In one of Tucker's papers,
he recounts a story

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
of a boy from Thailand,
who at the age of three

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
started complaining that
he had been shot and killed

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
in his past life while
riding a bicycle to school.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
He even remembered that
he was a local teacher,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and he remembered
his name, Bua Kai.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
His grandmother took him to the
village where he said he lived,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and he led her to a house.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
He recognized the
people living there,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and they confirmed that five
years earlier, their son, Bua

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Kai, had been shot and killed
while riding a bike to work.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
He was shot in the back of the
head, marked by a small entry

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
wound with a larger exit wound
in the front of his head.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The little boy had been
born with a small birthmark

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
on the back of his head and
a larger, oddly shaped mark

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:90%
on his forehead.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Closer to home, Dr.
Tucker investigated

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
a truly uncanny case in
Oklahoma that went on

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
to make national headlines.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:10%
When Ryan Hammons
was five years old,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:10%
he began telling his mother,
"I used to be somebody else"

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and "Take me home to Hollywood."

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The boy had a surprising
array of specific facts

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
on hand about his former life,
including dancing on Broadway,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
starring in films with Mae
West, and eventually becoming

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:90%
a powerful Hollywood agent.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Ryan's mother began looking
through books of old Hollywood.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And when she reached a still
image from the 1932 movie

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
'Night After Night,"
Ryan pointed to a man

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of a frame
and said, that's me.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
With the help of
Dr. Tucker, they

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
were able to identify this man
after weeks of investigation

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
as Marty Martyn, an extra
who had danced on Broadway

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and eventually became
a powerful agent.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Ryan was able to provide 55
specific details of Martyn's

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
life which would not have
been available without

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
an investigation, including the
name of the street he lived on,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
his work history, details of his
wives and children, and more.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we have led
past lives in which memories

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
could have transcended
into this lifetime,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
continuing to remain in the
depths of our subconscious?

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
There is widespread
evidence that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:90%
is hard to refute or explain.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Past life regression therapists
and traditional psychiatrists

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
are still at odds
as to what is really

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:84%
being accessed when
someone undertakes

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:90%
one of these sessions.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But some of the most astute
academics and doctors

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
have been convinced that
there's some sort of phenomenon

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
happening that can't
be easily explained.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:90%
