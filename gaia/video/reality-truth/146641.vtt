00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a story in the Bible
about God providing manna from

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:84%
heaven, food to sustain the
Israelites while they were

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
wandering in the wilderness, but
it never said specifically what

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:90%
What was this manna from heaven?

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
When I asked that
question, I had no idea

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
how much my life
was about to change.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.095 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.095 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The first miracle that Jesus
was reported to have done

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
was turning water into
wine at a wedding.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
The story goes that
they ran out of wine,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus put a portion of
the manna into the water

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
that they boiled as tea.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
He told the waiters to
pass it out as wine.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.721 align:middle line:84%
So I call up Deepak, and I said,
Deepak, I gotta talk to you.

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I go, I just found
some stuff in the Bible

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
that's not making any sense.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I think I found some
psychedelics in there.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I think there's meditation.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Like, what do you think?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And he's quiet on the phone.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
Deepak, are you there?

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, yeah.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, where did
you find this exactly?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.489 align:middle line:84%
Like, send me what you're
talking to me about.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do, Deepak?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.988 align:middle line:90%
What should we do about this?

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:90%
You want to write something up?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And Deepak was like,
this is too important.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
He was, like, why don't we
have a conversation about this?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Could part of the
religious experience

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
plant sacraments?

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
In Deepak's tradition,
the mystery plant soma

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
was used to bring people
to communion with God.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Could have been that the
Hymns of the Rigveda were

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:10%
actually sung to this
plant, which had no seeds,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:10%
that had no flowers, that
was really mushrooms.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a scene in the move,
"Noah," starring Russell Crowe,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:10%
where he has a dream that
he's under water with animals

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:10%
floating past.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
He wakes up, knowing that
God wants him to do something

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:90%
but he doesn't know what.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
He goes and sits
with the wise man

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in the cave, played by
Anthony Hopkins, who

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
gives him some psychedelic tea.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
He drinks it and has a detailed
vision of exactly what God

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
wants him to do.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all,
that's a possibility.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, why does our brain
have receptors to these things?

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.912 align:middle line:84%
Well, because we are
part of the same nature.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not
separate from nature.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Science is based on the
subject object split,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
on the separation
that is artificial, me

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and the universe, when, in fact,
I'm also part of the universe.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So the same
electrical storms that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
create thunder and
lightning in the sky

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
create synaptic firings in my
brain, which creates thought.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We're part of a wholeness, and
what the religious experience

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
is to experience that wholeness.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
What is enlightenment but
being one with the source?

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So once they give people,
what I wouldn't even

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
call altered state
of consciousness.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call
them hallucinations.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
They help people break out
of the everyday hallucination

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
of separation and to
the reality of truth.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And whether they did it through
wine, or manna, or soma,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:90%
who cares?

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't even make any sense.

00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
How could these ancient
plants that connect you to God

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:90%
be somehow taken out?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Could these plants be the
ancient wisdom that we need

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:10%
for our modern problems.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.935 align:middle line:84%
>> What we call today,
everyday reality,

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:09.528 align:middle line:90%
which we take for normal, OK?

00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:90%
There's war.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.266 align:middle line:90%
There's terrorism.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:13.669 align:middle line:90%
There's global warming.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.545 align:middle line:90%
There's social injustice.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
50% of the world lives on
less than two dollars a day.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
The environment is
totally screwed up.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And we say this is normal.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It's psychotic, right?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's psychotic because
we have created it.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.382 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think it would
take to break through that

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:90%
boundary at this point?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here we are
in this 21st century.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's have a party.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll bring everybody down
to Peru and enlighten them.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and put some in
the pot, and let's drink it.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:44.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Did Deepak Chopra just tell
me to go down to Peru and drink

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca tea, one of the most
powerful psychedelics known

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
to man?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Still dazed by what
Deepak had recommended,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I bumped into our
friend, Jerry, who

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
had generously loaned us his
beach house for the interview.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I was curious what he thought
about what Deepak said.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize at the
time, but Jerry's world

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:90%
was spinning out of control.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Despite having sold his company
for almost $100 million,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Jerry was abusing drugs,
drinking a lot of alcohol.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
His family was in shambles,
and he was basically

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.215 align:middle line:90%
trying to kill himself slowly.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
More than I realized, Deepak's
words were really sinking in.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
At this point, you
might be wondering

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
who this Zappy guy is.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a
little bit about myself.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I've done everything society
told me to do, go to school,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
get a job, make a bunch
of money, fall in love,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:90%
start a family.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I was living the American dream.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I bought beer.com for $80,000.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:10%
A few months later, I
sold it for $7 million.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, starring in
my own Super Bowl ad.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Life was becoming very surreal.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had it all,
my conversation with Deepak

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
made it clear that there
were other experiences that I

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
needed to have.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
The value that I place
on the experience

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:90%
is more important to me.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So I always felt like I'd rather
have a passport full of stamps

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:90%
than a house of a certain type.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me
that, like most people,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd been searching for
happiness outside of myself,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was having the
realization that I might never

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
be truly happy unless I
went inside my own mind

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:90%
to look for some answers.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein
famously said, you

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
can't fix a problem with the
same consciousness or thinking

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:90%
that got you into the situation.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
What this meant to me
was that if I wanted

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to solve a problem in my
life, or if we, as a society,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
wanted to solve some of
the big problems we have,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
like violence, eco-destruction,
addiction, depression,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we needed to change our
collective consciousness.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Could society use some of
these ancient techniques

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:90%
for its modern problems?

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired by people who
came before me, that seemingly

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
had it all but chose to
take the risk of going

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:90%
inside their own minds.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
These people were what I
would call psychenauts:

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
sailors of the mind.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that these people
were going inside their minds

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and exploring inside
their minds as part

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:90%
of what they wound up doing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
I have to do that.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I figured before I got too
extreme and sat with a shaman,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I should go out and talk
to some of Deepak's friends

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:90%
about our so-called reality.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>> If you only identify with
the realm of three dimensions,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:10%
if you only identify with
the realm of the body,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:10%
if you only identify with
the mortal circumstance

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:10%
and the mortal experience,
then to that extent,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:10%
you are at the effect
of those circumstances.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.795 align:middle line:84%
Faith is standing
on the conviction,

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
standing on the knowledge
and the conviction,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
there's something way
bigger going on here.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:10%
>> What we see is only a small
portion of the total reality.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:90%
See, we have three states--

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%
waking, dreaming, and sleep.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that,
there is a state

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
where it's neither of
the three, but there

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.622 align:middle line:84%
is this full alertness
that dawns deep within.

00:08:49.622 --> 00:08:54.442 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.442 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nowhere were we
escape from being energy.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:90%
So we're always energy.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:10%
What we see at it looks,
physical material,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:10%
is actually the reflection of
light, photons of light that

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:10%
hit our energy and bounce back.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're reflecting
light, but we're

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
reflecting it as a force
field, a tornado of energy.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> If we can stand
within the unreal world,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate unreal
that appears real,

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that seems limited by the
laws of time and space,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and yet have faith
in the realm beyond,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
that literally invokes
that realm into being.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It seemed like what everyone
was saying is reality is just

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:90%
a concept.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I needed to have the direct
experience of going inside.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Could ancient wisdom have
included plants and meditation?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:10%
I was excited to learn that
a lot of celebrities, people

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:10%
like Jerry Seinfeld,
Martin Scorsese,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:10%
were doing this meditation
for a long time.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And recently, people like Oprah
Winfrey and Dr. Oz and Katy

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:10%
Perry had taken
up the meditation

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:10%
and it seemed to be making
them even more creative.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see if some
of this ancient wisdom

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.710 align:middle line:84%
could help me to tap
into my creativity.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, a funny little
man named Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
came out of the Himalayas
to the United States,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and he wound up teaching his
transcendental meditation

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
technique to the Beatles,
and the rest is history.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, there are more than seven
million people worldwide doing

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
transcendental meditation.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What I like about a TM
technique is that there's

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
no dogma attached to it.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
a simple technique

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of silently repeating a
mantra to yourself, which

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
causes you to transcend
into your quieted mind

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to subtler and subtler states
of consciousness until a point

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
that you reach a place called
universal consciousness,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
an endless field of energy
that connects all of us,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
where all knowledge
is contained,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and where everything
is manifested from.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
When the Maharishi
passed away in 2007,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
he put John Hagelin in charge.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
As a quantum physicist
and a meditator,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
he had successfully
used quantum theory

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to support Maharishi's model
of creative intelligence

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
being at the center
of all creation.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Waking consciousness is all
about being aware of something,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:10%
this, that, this
concept, that person.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:10%
Transcending is leaving
all of that behind

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:10%
to isolate and experience
the self itself.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:90%
It's blissful.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of the story.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
10, 20 minutes of
that is enough.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to come
back into activity

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and increasingly
integrate and stabilize

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the experience of inner
reality, inner silence,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
along with outer reality,
and that's when life really

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.871 align:middle line:90%
gets to be interesting and fun.

00:11:56.871 --> 00:12:05.048 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:10%
>> The mind has
two aspects to it.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:10%
It's the brain, which
is very concrete.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:90%
You can measure it.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
You can touch it, but it's
interacting with this field

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they come together
is our individual self,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
our individual personality.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
people think they are.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm 5' 11".

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I have this education.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm this part in society.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:90%
I have this amount of money.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's not fundamentally
who you are, and to know that,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
you need to have the
experience of that,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's where meditation
experience comes in.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>> It was found that square
root of 1% in some cities here

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.275 align:middle line:10%
and there, and there, and
it does create positivity

00:12:58.275 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:10%
in the atmosphere, in the
tendencies of the people.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What excited me about this
was that if we wanted to change

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
global consciousness, we
only needed a critical mass

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
of people tapped in.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:84%
When I found in
the Bible, verses

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that said be still and know that
I'm God, the kingdom of heaven

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
is within.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.965 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
meditators are saying.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:20.765 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious.

00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.005 align:middle line:90%
The Bible is saying meditate.

00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.513 align:middle line:84%
These days, religious
affiliation is shrinking.

00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go speak to some
of the religious leaders

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and top scholars
of our time about

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.285 align:middle line:84%
whether meditation was
once part of religion.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
religious leaders,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
there's no one more high
profile than Joel Osteen.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.985 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask Joel what he
thought the manna from heaven

00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:05.785 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I've always taught that
it was like bread, you know,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.922 align:middle line:10%
like a mushroom or something.

00:14:09.922 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:10%
That's what I heard.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:12.677 align:middle line:90%
That's what I heard.

00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:14.135 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like it if
it was mushrooms.

00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:90%
We can sustain them.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I did not expect that.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Bible descriptions
from Moses and Jesus

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
sound more like
mushrooms than bread.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:10%
In fact, every other
miracle that Jesus

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:10%
is reported to have done was
after they drank the mushroom

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:10%
tea.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> St. Mark's
Basilica in Venice,

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.913 align:middle line:90%
Italy Here's all the disciples.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.894 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus with giant
mushrooms behind him.

00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, very cool, yeah.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We've got Jesus over here
with these giant mushrooms

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.416 align:middle line:90%
behind him.

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.298 align:middle line:84%
Jesus with the giant
mushrooms behind him.

00:14:55.298 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to some people
who had been there, done that.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:19.982 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.982 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I've probably had as much
psychedelics as anyone alive.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:10%
When you fall away for a
minute, something happens.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
beginning, and now, you

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
have to relearn the world
just like you were a baby.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>> What I found makes ayahuasca
very special, number one,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:10%
is it's the only mind altering
substance that needs more than

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.079 align:middle line:10%
one substance.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And the other fact
that's interesting

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is that both of these
substances, the MAO, which

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is harmaline or
tetrahydroharmine,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
or the DMT, both
of these substances

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
are produced in every
mammalian nervous system.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So they are substances
that our body produces.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Filmmaker Foster Gamble's
documentary, "Thrive,"

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:10%
shattered many of the myths that
we've been presented by regular

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:10%
society that keep us slaves
to our so-called reality.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So it seems to be a
natural inclination to alter

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.696 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness somewhat,
and I think one of the reasons

00:16:20.696 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:10%
for that is, when we
alter our consciousness,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:10%
we can see our daily
consciousness in a new way.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And it shifts, tends
to raise and expand

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
our daily consciousness,
and to me, that's the point.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we can use
substances, whether it's

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
broccoli or ayahuasca, or you
know, C-sharp major, to give us

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
a glimpse of what's
possible for human beings

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
what's next for me?

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:90%
What am I ready for?

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When my consciousness
separated from my body,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it changed the
paradigm entirely.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I realized, aha, there's
something more than this meat

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:90%
vehicle that we have.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And that one realization set me
off writing all night furiously

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:10%
until the dawn and
it just reevaluated

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:10%
my whole philosophy.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And from that
point on, I've been

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
on a journey of
experiential spirituality,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
finding the answers
myself, and the plants

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
have been the greatest
teachers in that quest.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Many times, there's a huge
benefit with one experience

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:10%
because it really gets to the
core of what's been happening.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like,
you know, 10 years

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of therapy in seven hours.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Kundalini yoga icon Gurmukh
teaches many celebrities how

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to journey inside using
the Kundalini technique.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
She had her own experience
with mind altering energies.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I do not regret
anything I have ever done.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You know people
say, I did drugs.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, so what?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It got you here.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I've met other
people that I wish

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
they had because I feel they
can't go through the barrier.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
They can't go into
that sixth dimension.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> However you
want to look at it,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be the unknown.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:90%
And you have a choice--

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.655 align:middle line:90%
fear or faith.

00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, faith
that you're gonna

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:84%
come out all right, that
the lessons are going

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.948 align:middle line:84%
to be valuable, and that
the medicine will guide you,

00:18:07.948 --> 00:18:11.729 align:middle line:84%
or fear, fear that something
else is gonna happen.

00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna be the
unknown either way,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%
so might as well choose faith.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There are times in life,
where through different means,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and God works in
mysterious ways,

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:90%
we're shown the mountain top.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like through grace.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like the hand of God
lifts us up and just shows

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:90%
us the mountain.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I owe a definite debt of
gratitude to my experience with

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:90%
various substances.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't endorse it unless
you're at a certain space,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
in a certain environment, with
certain true healers because it

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
can run havoc,
just like LSD did.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>> They are powerful
transformational tools and have

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:10%
to be respected.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you approach them with
enough humility and respect,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I tend to believe you'll
be fine with them.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> People are afraid that when
they go down there and do these

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.604 align:middle line:84%
medicines they're gonna lose the
things that they love the most

00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
this common fear.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get someone
who loves their career.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
What if I go down, and tells me
I want to be a yoga instructor?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, it's not
gonna do that, man.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, you're gonna
be even happier about the fact

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
that it did.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an opportunity
to use psychotropic drugs,

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
which will open up that
mind and show you, my god,

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:90%
who you really are.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm fascinated by it.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm interested in it.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:10%
I believe it will have real
utility somewhere I just--

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:10%
it's too soon for me, as
somebody that's trained

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:10%
a certain way--

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:10%
do no harm, help,
you know, really,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.387 align:middle line:10%
really be clear about
what you're doing.

00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:90%
We're not clear yet.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever it takes, whether
you do the drug or whether you

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
do the meditation
exercises or whatever way,

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no doubt in my mind
that the first indication,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the first formal use for
hallucinogens will be at end

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's clear what
I'm reading and seeing

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
in the research is that
it improves our ability

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
to be connected with something
and feel OK about the dying

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
process, and God knows we need
help with that in this country.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:10%
>> The traditional psychological
model or the traditional

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:10%
medical model, it usually
takes years, and years,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:10%
and years of therapy, and
years of intervention,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:10%
and working with a team of
experts to get even just

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:10%
a little progress
in someone's life.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen, and the
analogy I give is it's

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
10 to 20 years of
psychotherapy, often in one

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:90%
to two plant medicine sessions.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a relationship
to plant medicine when it is

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:10%
entered through the door of the
traditions that brings people

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:10%
more to a sacred recognition
of their life, their path.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the word drug really has
a lot of negative connotations.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of,
you know, maybe--

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
if some drug actually cures
someone, it's medicine.

as a researcher
at the University.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It was the 1960s and LSD

The government was studying its
effect on individuals and enemy

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
While a researcher at Harvard,
Alpert and Professor Timothy

Leary started to run
experiments on students

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
with psilocybin mushrooms
and LSD, both of which

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:90%
were legal at the time.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
The results were nothing
short of miraculous.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Users were reporting
that they were

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:84%
having life-changing
experiences, including

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
a study that showed that 60%
of alcoholics that were given

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
one dose of psilocybin mushrooms
in the right set and setting

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%
were never alcoholics again.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes with my
artwork and my creativity

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.705 align:middle line:84%
but in other ways with
less natural things.

00:25:56.705 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's an
anesthetic for pain or just

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
your day-to-day life
that gets you down.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, this is
something that's

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.382 align:middle line:84%
been calling me for a
while to come and do this,

00:26:08.382 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
but it hasn't been the
right moment in my life.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it all seemed to just
fall into place naturally.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm here to have sort of
like a rebirth, to, you know,

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:10%
tap into a place that, I
guess, I've never gone.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know where that is.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.352 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what that is, but
hopefully, it's a good thing,

00:26:28.352 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be able
to get through it.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When you drink
the medicine, 50%

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
of the medicine's responsibility
is to do all the healing,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
all the cleansing, all the
awakening, all the clearing,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:84%
all the harmonizing
that it needs to do,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
but the other 50% of
taking it further,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:84%
of taking it deeper
is always yours.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Part of my work in this is to
make the most gentle transition

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:84%
possible from being very
sleepy to being fully awake.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really looking forward
to tapping into some of those

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.547 align:middle line:90%
guys' stuff upstairs.

00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.131 align:middle line:84%
>> The San Pedro
trip was gnarly.

00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It was really insane because
Fredy Puma, you know,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
the shaman that introduced
us to the catalyst

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual
journey, you know,

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
which was the San
Pedro, the drink, he--

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:90%
so in tune, that guy.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.687 align:middle line:84%
And I recall, you know, being
at the top of the mountain,

00:27:57.687 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, at this plateau,
where we all, you know,

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:04.150 align:middle line:84%
were just so tired from
this massive, you know,

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.060 align:middle line:90%
high-altitude trek.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're finally, you
know, getting some air,

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking off at
these amazing clouds that

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:90%
are flying right at you.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And you're at the precipice of
this mountaintop, and you know,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:10%
you see hundreds
of feet below you.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I got this enormous
sorrow, that I was just

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed with.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:10%
And the sorrow that
consumed me was something

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:10%
that I've been carrying
for many years, kind

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:10%
of like a little rebellious
anger, like, why am I here?

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.764 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know,
like, Dad, you know,

00:28:44.764 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
like I didn't knock
on your balls,

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, to come
out into this, you

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.214 align:middle line:84%
know, universe kind
of anger that I've

00:28:50.214 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:84%
been holding since I was a
teenager, you know what I mean?

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Why stay in the past?

00:28:53.629 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Why suffer?

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Why struggle when you
can liberate all of that

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:06.547 align:middle line:84%
and be of higher service while
being gentle on yourself.

00:29:06.547 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that you need your ups
and downs so you can be human

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy life and transition
because it's part of the beauty

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of existence is to be
sad and enjoy happiness.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:90%
You need to know both sides.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But this overwhelming
sadness wasn't mine,

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.091 align:middle line:90%
didn't belong to me.

00:29:22.091 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was a little
kid, it didn't belong to me.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not mine.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm a passenger like Iggy Pop
says, you know what I mean?

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to ride this, you know,
in a respectful way, respect

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:10%
everything that I come across,
and you know, walk my path

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:10%
with love, and you
know, say goodbye

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:10%
after my journey's done.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And he came out and he just--

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I felt this warm
energy behind me,

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and there he was, while
I was on the rock,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
overlooking the clouds
that are flying towards me.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I was just cyring, you know?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.068 align:middle line:84%
And he touched my shoulder,
and he said, it's not yours.

00:29:57.068 --> 00:29:58.562 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:29:58.562 --> 00:30:00.056 align:middle line:90%
Whoo.

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:02.048 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:02.048 --> 00:30:04.538 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:04.538 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If my trip ended
today, I've had,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, 20 years of heavy
pain lifted off of my shoulders,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be a happy camper
without doing the ayahuasca.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm, you know, I'm feeling
really, really, really,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.300 align:middle line:84%
really light on my feet,
happy, appreciative,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.805 align:middle line:84%
and receptive, very
feminine, you know?

00:30:54.805 --> 00:30:55.605 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a tomboy.

00:30:55.605 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of about time I
step into my femininity.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> My full intent
coming down here,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
my maco intent was to try
to share with everybody

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world, for that matter,
the fact that there's different

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
ways to see reality and that
we sort of, in this moment

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
of chaos, need to take a step
back, everybody, and you know,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.730 align:middle line:84%
just try to see things
a little differently.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:10%
>> The only way that you're
supposed to fulfill your role

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:10%
is by being yourself.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:90%
That is the heightened you.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:35.115 align:middle line:84%
You attract more love, and
you attract more energy.

00:31:35.115 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
One of my intents and one
of the things I asked for

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:90%
was to face my fears.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that, no, I
don't need to face my fears.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:90%
My fears are not gonna go away.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:84%
First, I have to accept
myself with my fears.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Each person has a pattern
and that pattern is 50% woven

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.280 align:middle line:84%
by the person and
50% by the divine.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is capable of
changing that whole pattern.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
From being one person
one day, the next day,

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you're completely
another person.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm open to light and
love and just good vibes,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and anything that isn't on
that vibration or frequency,

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.486 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like--

00:32:14.486 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't even see you.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't exist.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I'm walking
into this ayahuasca trip.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in a very
receptive place.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I just, you know, I
know what I'm about.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I know what I stand for, and
I know what I resonate with.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I just
hope to walk that path

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and you know, whoever's
walking along that path,

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, I hope to meet
you, and we can join hands

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.556 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, take this
trip together, you know?

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:48.699 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.699 --> 00:32:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It happened for me in my
ayahuasca experience when I was

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:84%
sitting there and I realized
that I had just died.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
As I was looking at death
and experiencing death,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I saw how dynamic it was
and how much was going on.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I never
needed to fear death again.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It was totally liberating,
and as I spent time

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.910 align:middle line:84%
in this ayahuasca
experience, I realized

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that I was sitting in a place
where I could ask any question.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I could go into the future.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.795 align:middle line:84%
I could go into the past,
whatever I wanted to know.

00:33:22.795 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:90%
So I'm gonna ask a big question.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to ask, why
do bad things happen?

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And immediately
upon asking that,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I was ripped out into
the edge of space,

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:84%
back to where, when you're
a kid, you go, yeah,

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:90%
but what's past space?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And people go, oh, more space.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And what's past that?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:90%
More space.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I was out there on the
edge, looking at everything

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.100 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
basically contained,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:90%
like God would look at it.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm looking at it,
Spirit said to me, you see that?

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:90%
It's totally balanced.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it,
and I was, like, wow.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It's totally balanced.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.224 align:middle line:84%
If something happens
over here, it

00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:90%
will just be made up over here.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I had
that realization,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:90%
I was sucked right back in.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting in the room again.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And as I was coming out,
I just started to laugh.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:84%
I was laughing, and I realized
that I had just gotten

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:90%
the entire human cosmic joke.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Here we are with God, the
man with the white beard,

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and Buddha, and Mohammed,
and Jesus, all these men,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was with God,
and it was a woman.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:45.772 align:middle line:84%
That has stuck with me everyday
since my ayahuasca experience.

00:34:45.772 --> 00:34:52.458 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me, ingesting
the medicine was a destruction

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of everything I've ever known,
everything I've ever believed

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:84%
in, everything I ever
thought was true.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I tried to reason it for
a while, two days after.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Try to reason the idea that
it's a hallucinogenic drug,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Michelle.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:84%
It just, you know, it takes
things from your subconscious

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and projects them, you know?

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.760 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
no way that there's

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:84%
any truth in what
you envisioned.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just a trip.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, you read tons
of books on alchemy.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have tons of
information about symbolism

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.934 align:middle line:84%
and religion deep
embedded into your brain

00:35:50.934 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:90%
since you were a little kid.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But I know in my heart
of hearts it's not true,

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
that I have ever known

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.605 align:middle line:84%
could quite probably
be bullshit.

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And it makes me happy.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt a peace and calm I've
never experienced in my life,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
an overwhelming feeling
that I could relax,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
instead of constantly macheting
my way through life with

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.070 align:middle line:90%
my urban armor on.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It just stripped everything
away and put me in contact

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:84%
with something that was a
benevolent higher power is

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can
really describe it.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's such a hard time.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.734 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of
it, I don't know.

00:36:48.734 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like a surgery,
and I felt my wounds,

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:58.836 align:middle line:84%
my wounds just opened up,
and I was feeling pain.

00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I
grew up, and I was

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.100 align:middle line:84%
able to love myself
a little bit more.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Once I got through
that hard part,

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.450 align:middle line:10%
or the part that I
needed to get out,

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:10%
it was just definitely the best
life-changing experience that

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:10%
I've ever been through.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When people access
these medicines,

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:84%
they need to access with full
love, with full willpower,

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:42.390 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, they need
to find other ways.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:90%
People will transcend anyways.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time,
and these medicines

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:54.570 align:middle line:84%
are major assistance, major
helpers, major masters,

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:57.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, assisting this process
of transition for humanity

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
from one level of
consciousness to a higher

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I've lost a lot of
anger, a lot of hatred,

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of-- you know what?

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're an asshole,
be an asshole.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:08.755 align:middle line:90%
It's your fate.

00:38:08.755 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm easy now.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm not angry anymore
at all the mean people

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
in the world, you
know, because I accept

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're part of
it, and it's all good,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not my walk, but
you know, do your thing,

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.827 align:middle line:90%
and I respect your path.

00:38:25.827 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But don't come near me
with your evil energy

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.159 align:middle line:84%
because I'll knock
you the fuck out.

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:31.405 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It all comes down
to intent for me.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:84%
If your intent is
right, it's gonna work.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna be better
than you thought,

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're gonna have
a lot less chaos.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to me that
nature recognizes

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that people are highly
stressed and that people

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
need healing medicines for
the problems of addiction

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.174 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:39:06.174 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I kept looking for ways to
transcend on a daily basis,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was introduced to
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar,

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and his breathing technique
called Sudarshan Kriya.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The technique is being
done by millions of people,

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:84%
including prisoners and
inner city youth who've

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
been trained by Sri Sri
to use the technique

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to overcome their
physical environment

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and give themselves
internal strength.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Sri Sri's logic goes
that when we're born,

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.850 align:middle line:84%
we draw in our first
breath, and when we die,

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:90%
we let out our final breath.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But most people
think nothing of it

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in between, when,
in fact, breathing

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:84%
may be our most
valuable capability.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Breath is an
important tool, you know?

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:84%
For every emotion, there
is a particular rhythm

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.196 align:middle line:90%
in the breath.

00:40:05.196 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we attend to that
breath by manipulating

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:84%
your own breath, you can
slip into the altered state

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness at will.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I learned the Kriya
breathing, which blew my mind,

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I was able to put
myself into a psychedelic state

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:90%
with just my breath.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Lightning bolts were shooting
out of my hands and feet.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Time stood still.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I continued to get
together with my friends

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to talk about our
experience and how

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
we were integrating
our psychenaut

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:90%
training into our lives.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole group
of scientists, very few,

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.540 align:middle line:84%
but enough, who are saying
maybe brain doesn't produce

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.030 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, maybe brain
filters consciousness.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.584 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying
we're transmitters?

00:41:07.584 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> We're transmitters.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, cool.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And what you're transmitters
of is that infinite potential

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that you spoke of, that
feel of possibilities.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start to
break down the boundaries,

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.550 align:middle line:84%
then all that's left
is the infinite.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.297 align:middle line:84%
>> So the boundaries are like
your prejudices, things that,

00:41:25.297 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, that you've
accumulated throughout life,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that you either repel
or are attracted to?

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, every boundary
is a conceptual boundary

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.380 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.294 align:middle line:90%
>> This is an Earth rover.

00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
This gives me an opportunity
to come to this planet,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.630 align:middle line:84%
step into this suit, have
these life experiences,

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
be creative, and marvel at
this planet that we've come to.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny because A,
I started this whole thing

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:90%
not spiritual.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.850 align:middle line:84%
B, once I saw the nature of
the cell membrane, the cell

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:90%
receptors, I said, oh, my God.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Instantaneously,
I had to recognize

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:84%
if you buy the science,
then it's not is there,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:90%
is there not?

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a spirit.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So it really helped me
to bring my scientific mind

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and my kind of spiritual
experience together,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.849 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, they're
not different at all.

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
We're just discovering
through all these pathways

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.232 align:middle line:90%
how all that is one.

00:42:17.232 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> After I started to really
journey with the plants was

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:90%
when things sort of changed.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> When that older
boyfriend of mine--

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I was like 24 at that time,
and he told me I was an idiot.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're
very passionate,

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:84%
but you have nothing to back up
how you feel about the world.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.460 align:middle line:90%
You don't read.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have-- you
know, you read one book,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and you can get 20 years
worth of research in one book.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of like opened
up my mind to do research

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and to fill my mind.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I see the
world, I do a psychedelic,

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I think metaphorically.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I think on so many
different layers, you know?

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
enjoy the moment too.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I can chase sensations
like any of them, you know?

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I love to feel good and have
fun and interact with people,

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:84%
but you know, information
is so beautiful.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just tap into
the reservoirs or fountains

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.245 align:middle line:84%
of the people
before us, you know,

00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you never know where
it could take you.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When I lost
Paul, I was like--

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I went through about a year
of just being like an animal.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, what could I do physically
to just get my mind off

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of existentialism, get my mind
off how transient life is,

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and how we just come here and
can disappear at any moment?

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
How could I get
my mind off that?

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So I was just, fuck, summer,
crazy, nuts, berserko.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, I did everything
I could possibly

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:90%
do to hide from myself.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you that
my ayahuasca trip made

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:90%
me sad that he left me here.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It wasn't a
sadness that he's gone.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.374 align:middle line:84%
It was more like a jealousy
that he's there first.

00:44:23.374 --> 00:44:27.622 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's
fucked up, but yeah.

00:44:27.622 --> 00:44:30.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was affirmed to
me in the ayahuasca experience

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and some other trips
I've had in my life,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:84%
where what was happening is,
when I took the medicine or I

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:45.160 align:middle line:84%
meditated, and I went
inside, that basically,

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I was taking filters off
is what was happening.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.620 align:middle line:90%
So all this bullshit--

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Reticular activation system--

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.310 align:middle line:90%
it's like doors of perception.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.730 align:middle line:84%
When he popped it, he felt
like that filtration mechanism

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that we create by the age of
seven was just lifted off.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, how, like, you
receive so much information

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:84%
in your visual cortex,
but your brain only

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
accepts a certain amount so
that you're not overwhelmed.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:84%
That's your reticular activation
system deciding, according

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to your wants, likes,
and fight-or-flight,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.630 align:middle line:84%
deciding what information
you're gonna take in.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Each time I got together
with my fellow psychenauts,

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
we felt stronger and stronger
about the need to get

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.510 align:middle line:84%
the information out, so we
could help others to access some

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient techniques
that had been so profound

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:84%
We should just, you know,
this True Reality Society

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
should set up a place
in, like, Costa Rica.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Put a dome.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a haven for people
who think the same way.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Put them all around the world
and the consciousness of it is

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.480 align:middle line:90%
like--

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.148 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in.

00:45:48.148 --> 00:45:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo!

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm in.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All right

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything's rolling along,
things are falling into place,

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:59.056 align:middle line:84%
and you know, like everything
in life, you want validation.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
that it's having

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.200 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an effect,
beyond just, hey,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a good time.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning a lot.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm having all these
cool experiences.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But you know, is something
really happening?

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for some
kind of sign that, you know,

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.870 align:middle line:84%
it was making a difference
because I couldn't

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:20.650 align:middle line:84%
see what the difference was,
other than my own friends

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and people around me.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of thinking,
God, give a sign here

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, this
is making a difference,

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.040 align:middle line:90%
that there's something to it.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the phone
call came from Jerry,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:84%
who I hadn't seen since we shot
with Deepak in his apartment

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.210 align:middle line:90%
years earlier.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to me, Jerry had
taken Deepak's advice as well,

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and he went down to Costa
Rica to do a plant medicine

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.340 align:middle line:84%
called iboga, that comes
from an African root.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the strongest
psychedelic known to man

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and Jerry was taking
it to see if he

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.600 align:middle line:90%
could break his addiction.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.540 align:middle line:84%
The full moon came to
Jerry and asked him

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.520 align:middle line:84%
if he wanted to see why
he was so messed up.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Because of my life, I
had, like, addiction issues,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:10%
tons of women issues, ego
issues out the gazoo, smoking,

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:20.520 align:middle line:10%
drinking, you name it,
I was a fan, right?

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:10%
So I said, what's wrong with me?

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened then is
that my body went to a house

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.870 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't seen in 48 years.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It was my grandfather's house
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And at the front
of the house, like,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.300 align:middle line:84%
three-year-old me is
going like this to me,

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.220 align:middle line:90%
is like waving me in.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the floor,
and there was-- as a kid,

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I knocked over cranberry
juice or grape juice

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and it hit the wall, and
that stain was on the wall.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:84%
This is how perfect
detail, and then next thing

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, the kid opened the
door and went like this to me,

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.640 align:middle line:90%
like, go look at it.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather was sexually
molesting me, and I was three.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The moon told Jerry to go see
his dead grandfather and have

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.880 align:middle line:84%
him explain why he'd done
it and give him an apology.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Jerry went to see his
grandfather, who denied it ever

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:90%
happened, and sent him away.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:84%
She told him to get
his father to help

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:84%
him to get an apology
from his grandfather.

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said
that he was sorry,

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and I told him I forgave him,
even though he wouldn't do

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:90%
anything for me.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy, the shaman,
goes, hey, go to the moon.

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the moon,
back to the moon,

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Mrs. Moon,
what can you do for me?

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And she said, open your chest.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I went like this, and
my heart was in there.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And the moon took my
heart out and washed it.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said what--

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:04.740 align:middle line:84%
the shaman is saying,
what is she doing?

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.315 align:middle line:84%
I said, she's washing
it, like this, like,

00:49:07.315 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:90%
because she has hands, right?

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Crazy but truth.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:12.960 align:middle line:90%
She's washing it.

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, what should I do
with it, to the shaman.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, have her put
it in your left hand.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mrs. Moon, would
you put it in my left hand?

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And she put it in my left hand.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
want me to do with it?

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.410 align:middle line:90%
He goes, put it in your chest.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went to put it in
my chest, and it got here,

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and it was black again.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So it only stayed pink for like,
I don't know, five seconds.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not putting this
thing in me because it's shit.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's terrible.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ask
her for a new one.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Mrs. Moon, can
I please have a new heart?

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.374 align:middle line:84%
And then she gave me this
new heart, and then I said,

00:49:53.374 --> 00:49:54.790 align:middle line:84%
what do you want
me to do with it?

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.248 align:middle line:84%
She said, put it
in your left hand.

00:49:56.248 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Put it in your chest.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
I was a different guy.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> He hasn't
touched drugs since,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and he's able to have a drink
socially without needing to get

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:90%
drunk.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.540 align:middle line:84%
He's reunited with his family,
and for the first time,

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.190 align:middle line:90%
he's in a real relationship.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The first time I was
invited to do plant medicine,

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.150 align:middle line:10%
I thought the person was crazy.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:22.740 align:middle line:10%
I was like, you're gonna
take a drug to get spiritual?

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted nothing to do
with it, and it freaked me out.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, my mom's a meth
addict, and I was a meditator.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this woman, who
was like just a love in my life,

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.150 align:middle line:84%
invites me to go, and
I couldn't say no.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So I went, and that
night, she told me,

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.810 align:middle line:84%
set some intentions of
what you want to see.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
I want to see why

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I keep attracting
the same psycho

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:84%
guy over and over and over
with a different face,

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.110 align:middle line:90%
sucking the light out of me.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
that I wanted to see

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:90%
was what was I here to do?

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that night was just
one of the most amazing nights

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I was shown exactly who I
am, what I'm here to do,

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and exactly why I kept
attracting that same psycho guy

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.390 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing, because
Jerry and I wake up everyday,

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:90%
and we're just, like, wow.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Is this our life?

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, we just feel so blessed to
be in love with our best friend

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.730 align:middle line:90%
and to be doing what we love.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately, when I came
back and my kids saw me,

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they knew I was a different
guy, and they knew something

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.360 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.860 align:middle line:10%
>> As soon as he walked
through the door, I can, like,

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:10%
visibly see a difference,
let alone when I was actually

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:10%
talking with him.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, shocked, you know?

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, whoa, I've gotta
give this thing a whirl.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:46.890 align:middle line:84%
If it could turn him around
180, what could it do to me?

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I saw Gerard
after he did plant medicine,

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:84%
he didn't even have to
speak or say one word to me.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I could tell, as I walked up
to him about 15 feet away,

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I knew he was a changed person.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.490 align:middle line:84%
The chances of
someone coming out

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.390 align:middle line:84%
of that severe of a
lifestyle case is very rare.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't want
to drink anymore.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.813 align:middle line:84%
I was smoking two packs
of cigarettes a day,

00:52:09.813 --> 00:52:12.690 align:middle line:84%
went from that to
nothing immediately.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I can't even think
about doing drugs.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wouldn't even have the
thought to go do some drugs.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> He's like, Zappy, not only
did I take plant medicine,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and break my addiction
in one session,

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.560 align:middle line:84%
but I've actually opened up
a center for people to come

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and expand their
consciousness, heal themselves,

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:90%
break addiction, and it exists.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It manifested from
that conversation

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.560 align:middle line:84%
with Deepak that day, were
he said stir it up in the pot

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.525 align:middle line:90%
and drink it.

00:52:43.525 --> 00:52:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The moon told me--

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds so
ridiculously crazy--

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.980 align:middle line:84%
but told me to go buy
a center and to make

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.840 align:middle line:90%
it a plant-based center.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Told me what building to buy.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Told me what to pay for it.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Told me how to
treat my girlfriend.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Told me how to
treat my children.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Told me that
everything would be OK.

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> His place is called
Rythmia and where is it?

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Set up the place in,
like, Costa Rica.

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.380 align:middle line:90%
This was the miracle I needed.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:30.610 align:middle line:84%
This place had manifested out
of that single conversation

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and the desire to help
people break the wiring.

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The first ever
clinic, where people

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:42.060 align:middle line:84%
can go to expand
their consciousness

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and heal themselves.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:84%
While you're at
Rythmia, you can receive

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.310 align:middle line:84%
counseling and spiritual
development, including

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.630 align:middle line:84%
a program developed specifically
for Rythmia by Reverend Michael

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Beckwith called
The Answer is You.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a
consciousness-expanding program

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:06.760 align:middle line:10%
that allows people to, one,
take 100% responsibility

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.330 align:middle line:10%
for their own life, come out
of the shame and blame game,

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:11.700 align:middle line:10%
blaming others.

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Two, it moves you
through a period

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of forgiving yourself
and forgiving all others

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:90%
so that you can be clean inside.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Three, you begin to embrace the
vibration of intentionality,

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
having an intention
or a direction of how

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:29.740 align:middle line:90%
you want your life to be.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to choose this.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:36.490 align:middle line:84%
If we don't choose it, then the
undertow of the human society

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.450 align:middle line:90%
is choosing for you.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Going to a place
like, you know,

00:54:39.165 --> 00:54:42.680 align:middle line:84%
what's being created at Rythmia
is a place where you can

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.560 align:middle line:84%
literally just come
back to life's rhythm.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the miracle
that you're gonna get is that

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:48.800 align:middle line:90%
you're gonna get the real truth.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that
we are all, all of us,

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.700 align:middle line:84%
connected from the same thing,
and that love is the thing that

00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:90%
holds us all together.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.499 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
that truth, that's

00:55:03.499 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing that you've been
running from your whole life

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.420 align:middle line:90%
is that one truth.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
to a place like us,

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and you get to see
that that's the truth,

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.140 align:middle line:90%
then there's the miracle.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you can walk away
and go, you know what?

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I lost everything
this weekend, or this week,

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
but I gained my life,
and what more could you

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.355 align:middle line:90%
ask for in a vacation?

00:55:24.355 --> 00:55:32.190 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything I've gone
through has truly been worth it

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.030 align:middle line:84%
because even before
this movie's finished,

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.765 align:middle line:84%
it's already changed the world
because this place exists.

00:55:42.765 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Every act that comes from
purpose is supported by nature

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and has the potential
to change things

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.290 align:middle line:84%
in ways you could
have never dreamed of.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> How do I channel all of
this connection into being

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.870 align:middle line:84%
an efficient human being in
society, into giving back?

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because for me,
love is everything.

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.525 align:middle line:84%
>> That you almost have to have
a way to re-enter the ayahuasca

00:56:16.525 --> 00:56:22.620 align:middle line:84%
experience almost on a daily
basis to stay tapped into it,

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be through
meditation or through something

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.560 align:middle line:84%
that will deliver you back
there, if only for a moment.

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us had
life-changing experiences,

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.560 align:middle line:84%
so the question is, how could
these incredible plant energies

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.940 align:middle line:84%
be illegal today to
consume or even to study?

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
answer to that question

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.070 align:middle line:84%
may be even more sinister
than the reason they've been

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.040 align:middle line:90%
taken out of religion-- money.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical
companies are only

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:58.350 align:middle line:84%
interested in selling their
patented petroleum-based

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.630 align:middle line:84%
medications that
people need to take

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.770 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:84%
These drugs do not cure
but only mask the symptoms

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and have significant
negative side effects.

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, living my entire
life sustained by plants.

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm eating vegetarian,
and my day job

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.590 align:middle line:84%
is bringing out a
plant-based formula

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to help people with addiction.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.098 align:middle line:84%
I owe everything to
these ancient tools.

00:57:26.098 --> 00:57:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Plant medicine,
meditation, breathing,

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.860 align:middle line:84%
these are some of the
tools that were once part

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.840 align:middle line:90%
of the religious tradition.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.668 align:middle line:90%
It's time to bring them back.

00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.900 align:middle line:84%
We started the True Reality
Society to create a peace army

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to counteract mass
violence in the world,

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and to bring together
people who believe

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.572 align:middle line:84%
in the importance of
going inside their minds.

00:58:04.572 --> 00:58:11.937 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.937 --> 00:58:14.392 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:58:14.392 --> 01:04:51.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Breathe in slowly, and
then breathe out slowly.

01:04:55.795 --> 01:04:59.008 align:middle line:90%


01:04:59.008 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:10%
On the in breath, perhaps
having the thought peace,

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:11.018 align:middle line:10%
and on the out breath,
the thought joy.

01:05:11.018 --> 01:05:19.562 align:middle line:10%
Peace on the in breath
and joy on the out breath.

01:05:19.562 --> 01:05:27.660 align:middle line:90%


01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And bring your awareness
into your heart

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:35.860 align:middle line:10%
now, and remember a
great experience of love.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:47.430 align:middle line:90%


01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Remember a great
experience of compassion,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:10.030 align:middle line:10%
a great experience of joy, a
great experience of equanimity,

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.552 align:middle line:10%
the peace that
passes understanding.

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:16.440 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And now bring your awareness
back into your whole body,

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:28.700 align:middle line:10%
and allow the boundaries of
your body to slowly dissolve,

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:32.810 align:middle line:10%
and merge with
your surroundings.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:35.840 align:middle line:90%


01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Recognize that every
boundary is conceptual.

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:41.397 align:middle line:90%


01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.230 align:middle line:10%
There's no boundary.

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.030 align:middle line:10%
There are no
national boundaries,

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:48.560 align:middle line:10%
no tribal boundaries,
no ethnic boundaries,

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.380 align:middle line:10%
no racial boundaries,
no religious boundaries.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.080 align:middle line:10%
They're all
imagination, and they

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.170 align:middle line:10%
have limited our potential.

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:03.870 align:middle line:10%
We are the stars, and we are
the sky, and we are the moon,

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.170 align:middle line:10%
and we are the galaxies.

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.340 align:middle line:10%
We are the cosmic horizon.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.610 align:middle line:10%
We are the Big Bang.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.430 align:middle line:10%
We are the laws of nature.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:17.390 align:middle line:10%
We are Planck scale
space-time geometry,

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:22.850 align:middle line:10%
where everything dissolves
into all possibilities,

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:26.960 align:middle line:10%
were platonic values like truth,
goodness, beauty, harmony,

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.340 align:middle line:10%
evolution are embedded as
the essential raw material

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:35.060 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, where there
is mathematical truth but also

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:40.910 align:middle line:10%
musical truth, where there is
the poetry of the universe,

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:45.905 align:middle line:10%
and the dance of the universe,
and we are that dance.

01:07:45.905 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:10%
As Sufi poet Rumi says, look
at these words spinning out

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:50.540 align:middle line:10%
of nothingness.
