00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.082 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE WOODARD: Bacon and eggs
all right for breakfast, Henry?

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.024 align:middle line:90%
HENRY: Yes.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:11.966 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE WOODARD: That's
good because that's

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.665 align:middle line:90%
what we're getting.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:90%
My name is George Woodard.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.425 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a small dairy farm
in middle of the state Vermont,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
which is over on the east
side of the country there.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at a
map, it's on the right.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.743 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you know what?
-What?

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Your mouse has got five legs.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.699 align:middle line:84%
Oh wait.
Oh, yeah.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh no.
Oh.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I put that as
a tail, I forgot.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was a leg.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, better erase one
of them tails, huh?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well this farm was bought
by my grandfather in 1912.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And he farmed it until
my father and mother took

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:90%
over in '46 after World War II.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
In '75, when I
got out of school,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure on what to do,
and we had this farm, you see.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, well, you
know, maybe I'll raise up

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of calves, milk cows.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So that was 25 years
ago and I'm still here.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.745 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:14.715 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha.

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:90%
How do you like my milk stool?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good, huh?

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't come much
better than that.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.807 align:middle line:84%
If you got this cow over
here, you got the machine on,

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
you got this cow
over here and you're

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:90%
starting this cow like this.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
That machine
happens to fall off,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
you just whip around quick,
grab it quick, just like that!

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The thing about working
seven days a week

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
is you don't have to
worry going back to work

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
on Monday when Sunday comes.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.564 align:middle line:90%
Don't dread it, you know.

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about having a small farm

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
is you get to see
your child grow up.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't send them to day
care, and that kind of thing.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have my son half
the time, every other week.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
He's here with me all day,
and it's just delightful.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Just watch him grow up here.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And look how-- look how he's
over there with that cow.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a beautiful thing.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.812 align:middle line:90%
Just beautiful.

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And he's a good boy.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:90%
He plays fiddle.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Takes fiddle lessons.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.367 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like it, but he
does it anyway, you know.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:23.846 align:middle line:90%
[FIDDLING]

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:28.319 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.313 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE WOODARD: Once more.

00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:32.295 align:middle line:90%
[FIDDLING]

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:33.786 align:middle line:90%
Hee hee hee ha ha.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Some day I'm
going to climb up and down

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.218 align:middle line:90%
the other side of the mountain.

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:47.146 align:middle line:84%
Some day, I'm gonna fly,
some where over the rainbow.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.604 align:middle line:84%
And I'm gonna make
my dreams come true.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:56.532 align:middle line:84%
La da da dee dee dee dee
la da dee dee dee dee

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:02.954 align:middle line:84%
And I'm gonna make
my dreams come true.

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.824 align:middle line:84%
Hey, another good one
you've written there, George.

00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean another?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's the only I ever wrote.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.715 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:11.081 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE WOODARD: For
the last three years,

00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of delved
into a little bit

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
of film directing
using my nephews,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and nieces, and my son.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But hold on that for
a couple seconds,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
so that-- so that we can
cut in the middle of it.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.849 align:middle line:84%
OK?
Action.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I try to create stories
around what I've got right

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:90%
here, to keep my expenses down.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.421 align:middle line:84%
For instance, this is just a set
that I threw up in my hay barn

00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.928 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:39.864 align:middle line:90%
Cut.

00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%
One take.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It is fun to watch the
whole thing come together

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:90%
with everybody participating.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.982 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a production called
"Dracula, the Musical."

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.392 align:middle line:90%
Ahh.

00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Ahh.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.825 align:middle line:84%
He's got a great
sense of humor.

00:03:58.825 --> 00:03:59.524 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:01.224 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE WOODARD: Come my
darling, come take my hand.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's fly away.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.453 align:middle line:84%
BAND MEMBER 1: He'll
do a whole performance

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and then go home
and milk the cows.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.032 align:middle line:84%
BAND MEMBER 2:
Tear the set down.

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:07.765 align:middle line:90%
BAND MEMBER 1: Uh-huh.

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:90%
BAND MEMBER 2: Go home and milk.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.122 align:middle line:90%
And do it again the next day.

00:04:12.122 --> 00:04:14.356 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE WOODARD: (SINGING) I
ain't saying that my life is

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:19.592 align:middle line:84%
bad, but Lord, I wish that I
only the comforts that they

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:90%
can't build in machines.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
BAND MEMBER 1: There was a
period of time when he left

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the farm and went out West.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.071 align:middle line:90%
Went out to California.

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:27.454 align:middle line:90%
I loved LA.

00:04:27.454 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But this works on a small scale,
and that seems to be-- seems

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:90%
to be enough, for me, anyway.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.735 align:middle line:10%
(SINGING) Running naked
in the summertime.

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And clothes out drying
on an old clothes line.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Fishing on a lake
with a friend of mine.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
important than watching

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.891 align:middle line:84%
your children grow up,
learn new things every day.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Sunshine.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I just love it more
than anything else.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:12.434 align:middle line:90%
