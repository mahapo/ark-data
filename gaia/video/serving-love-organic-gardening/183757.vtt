00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Springtime in Melbourne,
the chance of frost is pretty

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:90%
minimal now.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
We're in the first
week of October.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.493 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't
already done so, now's

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
the time to start planning
your veggie garden.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So the first crops we
start for in spring

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:84%
are basically, your chards, your
silver beet, beetroot, beans,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.795 align:middle line:90%
peas, onions, lettuce.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
All of that sort of
stuff can be concentrated

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
on your first few
weeks of spring.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
these are all so big

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
is they were left to overwinter
so that we always had

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:90%
some greens during the winter.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Some perpetual perennial spinach
there and the rainbow chard.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And the new crops
go in behind it.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So that when these are
finished the end of summer,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
the second half will be right to
overwinter for the next season.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:90%
So here we have our kale bed.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We've grown a couple of quite
rare varieties this year.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:90%
We're just trialing a couple.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This one's a kale yard
kale from Scotland.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an extremely
old heirloom variety.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And this one here's
from Britain, also.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a sea kale.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And this one grows
wild along the coast.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, this one
would have sustained

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Romans and Greeks.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very old variety.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And this one here is your
Tuscan kale, your black kale,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:90%
which is a common one.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So kales can be put in
any time of the year.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.033 align:middle line:84%
And again, I would normally
have a bed that I overwinter.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
That hasn't been done this
year because I needed the space

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:90%
and I had redone them.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's no real need to
overwinter it because kale,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
you can plant in
succession all year.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is our new
crop of rainbow chard.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a green
leafy vegetable.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So all the green
leafy vegetables,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:90%
we're eating the leaves.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about
tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
capsicums, eggplants, they
are a fruit that forms

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and they need
pollination from bees.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So every few beds, I plant
some sort of flowers or herbs

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:90%
that attract bees.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a borage so the
young leaves can be eaten.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And especially, the dark blue
flowers are great in salad.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But the bees
absolutely love them.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So every few beds,
put one in the middle.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle line:90%
So why organic?

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Because this is produce
fresh as nature intended.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't walk into a
supermarket and do that.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Because your produce
is sprayed and treated

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
with hundreds of chemicals that
are on the accepted chemical

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:90%
list.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
That are OK today, but
when we start finding out

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the ill effects of what it does
to our body in 20 years time,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
they'll be on the banned list.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
with things like DDT

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and other very dangerous
chemicals that are now

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:90%
banned and now, cancerous.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
We lose several chemicals
a year off the list

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
that we were allowed to use and
now we're not allowed to use.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So the chemicals
they're using today,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
which are accepted today, are
on the banned list in 10 years

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Do we actually know what
we're putting into our bodies?

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:90%
We haven't got a clue.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't have
to disclose everything

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that goes onto these
fruits and vegetables.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Why is that a problem?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you feed these
unknown substances

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
into your family,
yourself, your children.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And your children are
not responsible for what

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:90%
they're fed, you are.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have a responsibility
to our families,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to our health about the things
that we put into our bodies.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And with all the chemicals
that are accepted

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to be used in standard farming
practices, if you buy organic,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:90%
they're not accepted.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:90%
There is a reason for that.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's because there are
no good chemicals that

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:90%
are used in plant production.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
They are all dangerous because
they're used to kill insects,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
to kill bacterias.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And what the system says
that in small quantities,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's OK for
human consumption.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So if they tested this rainbow
chard from a supermarket

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and said it had so many parts
per million of an accepted

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
chemical so that's
not dangerous,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
what happens when you
are eating that 365 days

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%
of the year for 40 years?

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you have a problem
because they don't take that

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:90%
into consideration.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that these
things build up in your system,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
just like heavy metals
do like mercury.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Toxins build up in your tissues,
your fat cells, your liver.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is you're not going

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
to see any detrimental
effects from one meal

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or even from six
months of eating it.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But over 40 years, we start to
see the effects of ingesting

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:90%
dangerous chemicals.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to do that.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Buy organic produce.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Australia has one of the
best systems of maintaining

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:90%
organic certification.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So people have to pass
their certification

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.335 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If they're found to
have used something

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that isn't acceptable
in the test,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:90%
they're taken off the list.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%
So buy organic produce.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Your supermarkets are
starting to get more of it

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
now because it's
a case of demand.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the more you demand
it, the more they'll stock.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The more it becomes available
and the cheaper it will become.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.935 align:middle line:84%
Buy organic, it's
better for you.

00:06:35.935 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It's better for the planet.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a look at
an example of seedlings.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%
These are lettuce.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
These around about
two weeks old.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And we do ours in
individual peat pots.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
more expensive,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
but the reason we do it is
because we avoid the transplant

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
shock.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, the roots
all form on the outside.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to take
the part off the outside.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You just dig a hole,
plant it at soil level.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And the plants take off as
if they were planted directly

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's no setback
or shock, whatsoever.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So with these, we plant
three or four seeds.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the
strongest one comes up,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
we cull out the others,
we thin them out.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And just grow on the
strongest seedling.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is lettuce.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.092 align:middle line:84%
We do many other types
different times of the year.

00:07:41.092 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We're doing these
now, it's autumn.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.810 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just have
a quick look at how

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:90%
we prepare these little pots.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So the product we use for the
base of our seed raising mix

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and for all the sprouting, the
wheat grass and the sprouts,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
is coconut coir-peat, which
is the leftover product

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:90%
of the coconut industry.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
The outside of the
coconuts are ground up

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:90%
into a peat-like substance.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It has no peat moss in it, but
it's called coconut coir-peat.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing you've
got to remember

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is that because
we're organic, you

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.190 align:middle line:84%
have to make sure that there
isn't any synthetic fertilizer

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
in the product when you buy it.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So this one has no
fertilizer added.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it
just needs a soak.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way we get around
the fertilizer issue,

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to add fertilizer
because as far as growing

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
on your sprouts or starting
off your seedlings,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
a seed has enough energy
inside it to get them going.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.762 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to grow
them on for any period of time,

00:08:54.762 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
fertilizer is good.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So because this has
none, we pop that

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
in a bucket that's big enough
to handle it when it expands.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, a brick that size takes
4 and 1/2 liters of water.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're using the sea salt
with seaweed concentrate.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:90%
It is certified organic.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So we just use the
required amount.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And we just mix that in.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Now this will just soak.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:90%
It only needs two, three hours.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:90%
We leave it overnight.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We pop that in and you
end up with about 9 liters

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
of coconut coir-peat.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And here's what it looks
like after it's been soaking

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
about four or five hours.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's very loose, soft.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And we would use this to plant
our sprouts on or our wheat

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:90%
straight onto this.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of
our seedlings, we

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
use this as 50% of
our seed raising mix.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll show you
how we mix that up.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
For our seed raising mix, we
start with our own compost.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But you could use a seed raising
mix, preferably an organic one.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And we give that
a couple of sieves

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.065 align:middle line:90%
to get out all the big material.

00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
After our first sieve, we'll
give that a second sieve.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And we just use a lighter
finer grade sieve.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a little time consuming,
but it's well worth the effort.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So what we end up with is a
very fine rich compost material.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we add
50% of this and 50%

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:90%
with our coconut coir-peat moss.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with this,
this is our finished product.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very light.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It retains moisture
extremely well.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
for the seedlings

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to push up without compacting.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've found that to be the
most successful seed raising

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
formula.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
starting off the seedlings

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is we've got our premium
quality seed raising mix.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
We start off with our
55 mil little peat pots.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.475 align:middle line:84%
These come in a packet, you
can just buy these at Bunnings.

00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And you buy the trays
that they fit in.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I put them in a solid base tray.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you fill
that up with water,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
they take it up from the base.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to try and water
your seedlings from the top

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and wash off the
soil, which makes it

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
difficult for very fine seeds.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing with
these is, though, I

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
haven't been able to
find them at Bunnings

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
so I buy mine just
online on the internet.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I think these ones
came off eBay.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're just after
a solid base tray.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And the 55 mill trays
come from Bunnings.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.335 align:middle line:90%
We just pop these in.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll just do a
few just to show.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.722 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.127 align:middle line:90%
So you pop those in there.

00:12:39.127 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Just grab a handful.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Just run it over the top.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll just push it down
lightly with two fingers.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, one more
run over the top.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And basically, that's it.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
You plant your seeds
directly into that.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Fill up the base with water.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Pop it in.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It soaks up the water,
it soaks the pot.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And you get the adequate
amount of moisture in there.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's the easiest way to
keep them continually moist,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
just keep topping the
base up with water.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
It's also how we fertilize
ours by mixing the seaweed

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.238 align:middle line:84%
concentrate and just pouring
it into there, as well.

00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And they just take
up what they need.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you the process
of how we grow wheat grass,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
but the process for wheat grass
and growing sprouts on a medium

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
is the same.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
What we use for our wheat
grass is a milling wheat,

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
a certified organic
milling wheat.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So one important point
about the wheat that you use

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
is that it must be fresh.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you just go
to your cupboard

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and get some wheat out,
you might get a 30%, 50%

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:90%
germination rate.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you buy
fresh wheat, you'll

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:90%
get 100% germination rate.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:90%
It'll come up nice and quickly.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And it won't yellow
off and you'll

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%
get a beautiful healthy growth.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.062 align:middle line:84%
So make sure that you're
always buying fresh wheat.

00:14:26.062 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The process that we go
through, a lot of people

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
would say why do you
bother growing wheat

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:90%
grass on a medium at all?

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you can just soak
it and put it on some paper

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
towel and grow.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that's not organic.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
When you've got a
paper towel, it's

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:90%
been bleached in chemicals.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you place
the seed on there

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and it takes up those
chemicals, you're

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:90%
consuming those chemicals.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's not organic.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a wise thing to do
since you're taking the wheat

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
grass for health.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it just concentrates
all those chemicals.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
If you took a piece of paper
towel and squeezed it out,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
you'd have this liquid with the
chemicals and the bleach in it.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't drink that.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly
what you're going

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
to do if you're going to
grow wheat grass on it.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're growing it on a
completely safe medium.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It just gives the roots
something to get into.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Because wheat grass,
you get two crops.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Once you've had your wheat
grass come up, you crop it off.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get a
second crop off it.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll just show you
we use 1 cup of wheat.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I use a sieve and a bowl
that the sieve will fit into.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to
take it in and out.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.378 align:middle line:84%
And you can run that
under water, if you want.

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't think there's any need.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Basically, just fill that up.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Make sure all the
grains of wheat are wet.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, we just
soak that overnight.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's one that
we soaked overnight.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
You can see the difference.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:90%
The grains have all swollen up.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
They've taken up all the water
they're going to take up.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
If you leave it much
longer than that,

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a chance that
they'll stop fermenting.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll show you the
medium that we grow it on.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're back to our
coconut coir-peat.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't have any
soil in it at all,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:90%
it's just the coconut coir-peat.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And soaked in that mild
solution of sea soil, which

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:90%
is organic seaweed fertilizer.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
We basically just give
that a thin coating, just

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.382 align:middle line:90%
flatten it out.

00:16:53.382 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I usually use a piece of
wood just to flatten it out,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
but it's not that necessary.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:90%
We tip that over the top.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%
Just spread it out.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to
be done precisely,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:90%
just give it an even coat.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that the
roots come through the bottom.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a well
of water in here,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that's basically enough for
two, three days, four days.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It just pops in
there, it soaks it up.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have the problem
of continually having to spray

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:90%
it two or three times a day.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So that'll save you
with all the watering.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we just give that
a fine mist of water with a

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
rose spray.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Pop it into a dark cupboard.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people place a sheet
of paper or cardboard

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:90%
over the top.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And when the sprouts lift the
paper or the cardboard up,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
they to bring it
out into the light.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I just put it in
a dark cupboard,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
basically, for about
two or three days.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we get our
first stage of shooting

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's approximately
at day three.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's one day.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
The difference that one
day makes as soon as you

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:90%
take it out into the sun.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
You can do this in your kitchen.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Filtered sunlight,
not direct sunlight

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
because it dries it
out far too quickly.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's day four.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And growing very healthy.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to plant
some early potatoes.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
These ones are an
Australian variety

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
called Toolangi Delight,
a purple variety,

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
are great for using
as new potatoes early.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to
show you a few tools that

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:84%
make it easy planting in
any sort of vegetable bed.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Most people after just get used
to it, you don't really worry.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But to start off
with, there are things

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
you can use like plum
lines of some sort

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:90%
to keep your rows straight.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So you just keep moving
those at the same distance

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.613 align:middle line:84%
and everything's
all nice and square.

00:19:09.613 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can
end up with something

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that looks rather hieldy by
the time you get to the end.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can cut sticks
or pieces of chew

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:90%
with the length written on it.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
When you know when
you grow so many

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
different things
and you know what

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
the spacing is, like the
potatoes, 40 centimeter.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So you mark where
your first one is.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
You can use little markers,
just go one there, one there,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:90%
and one there.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
all the way down

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
the bed, 40 centimeters apart.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So there starts the
next one, there.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.693 align:middle line:84%
And then, it's completely
uniform all the way down.

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So all you do is you
just dig your hole.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And just a handful
of organic fertilizer

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
mixed in the bottom of the hole.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
These potatoes are
being chitted already,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
which means they're
left out in the light.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Not in the direct sun, but just
in the light for a month or so,

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:90%
so their eyes start to develop.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And you put the strongest
ones to the top.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Now just the point,
I'm not going

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
to bother knocking any of
these shoots off, the chits.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people knock
them all off and just

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:90%
leave the strongest one.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And that means you'll
get fewer potatoes,

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
but you'll get much
bigger potatoes.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So every branch that comes up
here will grow potatoes off it.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But the more that
the one plant has

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:84%
the support the more growth,
the smaller the potatoes.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's just choice.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So we just cover that in.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
You always should be buying
certified seed potatoes, which

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
means they're certified
to be disease-free.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
By just growing the
same potatoes out

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of the same patch
year after year,

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:84%
you can get disease
in your plants, which

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:90%
then becomes part of your soil.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's crucial to
rotate your beds every year.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy certified
seed potatoes,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
don't use the ones
from the supermarkets.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.315 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because in the old days,

00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you used to leave them in
the cupboard and they all

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:90%
used to shoot.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's difficult to get
them to shoot and when they do,

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
it takes them a lot longer than
what the organic potatoes do.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The reason being is because
the potatoes that you're

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:84%
buying in the stores are all
sprayed with a growth retardant

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to stop the shoots
from coming in.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
They're either
sprayed or dipped.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Now that material, which
has a name that long,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
is being looked at the
moment as causing problems.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.328 align:middle line:84%
And some countries are wanting
to take that off the list

00:21:53.328 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
because there's some
associated problems with it.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment,
all the potatoes

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
you buy in your
standard supermarkets

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
are all being dipped or
sprayed in a sprout retardant

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to stop this from happening
when they have them in storage.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Now if you go in and
buy your potatoes

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and you want your
products labeled,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.723 align:middle line:84%
you try and find a
label that tells you

00:22:12.723 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals that are involved
in what they dip and spray

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:90%
these with.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.833 align:middle line:90%
You won't find it.

00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happens with the things

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that you buy that
are not organic.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of those sort
of products and chemicals

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:84%
that go into the production
of these things that

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:90%
don't have to be declared.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.487 align:middle line:84%
And you have no idea what
you're feeding your family

00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this bed's been
prepared for tomatoes.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:90%
As I said, we rotate our beds.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So we'll plant tomatoes
in this bed this year

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and this bed will not
see tomatoes for at least

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:90%
another three years.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And that minimizes our
risk of soil-borne disease.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So this has been prepared over
the winter with composted cow

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
manure.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And our cow manure is composted
and then spread thickly

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:84%
across the top,
dug in minimally.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, the worms
and the organisms do the work.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So you don't disturb the soil
as much as you possibly can.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So over the winter time, it's
absolutely chockablock full

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:90%
of worms now.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
start planning tomatoes.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now just as I showed you
before with the piece of pipe

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
measuring your
planting intervals,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:84%
you can also make
up different frames.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:84%
This has been made
up for tomatoes.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, all you
do is you place it

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:90%
where tomatoes are going.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete square
so the dimensions

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:90%
are correct from any angle.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And on each corner, you're
putting in your stakes.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's just rough, I'll
do those, again, in a minute.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So you put those in and then
you just turn the frame.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
From there, and then
next to your next spot

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
for your next one, and then
you turn the frame, again.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And you just go all
the way down the bed.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So that automatically
measures your intervals.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we're planting,
we'll just dig a hole.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're just planting
at the base of the stake.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
The stakes go in
first for two reasons.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:84%
One, because they give
you your intervals.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.825 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, after the
tomatoes are established

00:24:32.825 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and you put the stakes
in, quite often,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:90%
you can damage the taproot.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We put them in to begin
with and then, we've

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
got a support base
straight away.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
You want to just
tease out the bottom.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, tomatoes suffer from a
thing called blossom endrot,

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:90%
which is a cruel disease.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because your tomatoes
will look beautiful

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
through the whole
season and it then

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.568 align:middle line:84%
before you go to
pick them, they'll

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%
get these big, brown
rotten spots on them.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're unusable.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
That's because the plant
can't take up calcium.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It usually to do with the
moisture levels in the soil,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:90%
irregular watering.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Regularly water your tomatoes
at a regular interval

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:84%
is the best possible
thing to do.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just
water them well, go away

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
for three weeks and the soil
dries out and then water them,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
again, that interrupts
their uptake of calcium.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And that can cause
blossom endrot.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the soil needs
to have calcium in it, as well.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is agricultural gypsum.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we use a handful
of agricultural gypsum,

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
a handful of organic fertilizer,
just move that around a bit,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
put your tomato in,
now, a lot of plants

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
you can't bury them any
lower than the collar

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:90%
because they rot.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:84%
With tomatoes, the deeper you
bury them, the more roots they

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:90%
will send out.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The more roots they send
out, the bigger, healthier,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
more vigorous the plant will be.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the
more fruits you'll get.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So always plant your
tomato plant deeper

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
than the pot level.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So you can put that down
a couple of inches below.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:90%
So we bury that in.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:90%
We label it.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:90%
We water it.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And then we put our mulch on.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And the mulch will end up
going all the way down the bed.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't be scared,
again, to lift that

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:84%
up a couple of inches
above the stem.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And we'll deeply
mulch the whole bed.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So labeling is crucial.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This is just a little
label that comes that we

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:90%
stick in when we grow the seed.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But because we save all our own
seed in the vegetable garden,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:90%
it's crucial to label correctly.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So with the tomatoes or
anything with a stake,

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
you either use a bigger
tag in the ground

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:90%
that the birds can't pull out.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Or you use one of the normal
plastic tags with a hole in it

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
or put a hole in it and
just tie it to the steak.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Or use a little aluminum tags.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.042 align:middle line:84%
But putting a tag on
the wind won't blow away

00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:90%
and the birds won't pull out.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.917 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
worse than going

00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:26.915 align:middle line:84%
to save your seed and
you can't find the tag

00:27:26.915 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:90%
or remember the name.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Why mulch?

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Mulch is critical.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It actually maintains
the moisture in the soil

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
so you get much
less evaporation.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
spring and the autumn,

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
if you've had normal
spring and autumn rain,

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
you may not need
to water at all.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Just because of a
thick layer of mulch

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that keeps the
moisture in the soil.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So the other reason is, is
because all the microorganisms

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
underneath come up and start
breaking down the mulch.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And they start
turning the soil over

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and you get a very
healthy soil environment.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
If it's just being dried
by the sun, all of this

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:90%
stays basically dead.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't retain the
moisture properly.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
The roots at the
top won't thrive.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And all the organisms are
moving down further in the soil.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So we keep a nice
thick layer of mulch.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have great movement of
all those organisms in the soil

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:90%
as they break this mulch down.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
This is organic
sugarcane mulch, but you

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:90%
can mulch with anything.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I prefer not to mulch with
straw because it's too light

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't retain moisture.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And it dries out far too fast.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:90%
And the wind blows it away.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Or you can use your own.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:84%
You can grind up
your own dry leaves

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and sticks in your own mulching
machine and spread that out.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But the thicker it is and the
heart of the material the wood,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll have less
moisture retention.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So this actually mats down,
stays moist on the bottom,

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:90%
and stays like that.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is just
water through the hottest period

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:90%
during summer.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And for the rest of the
time, our sprinklers

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:90%
won't even come on.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So something we've devised,
which isn't hard for anybody

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to set up, is a
hoop system so you

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:84%
can get your greens in, and your
eggplants, and your capsicums,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and chillies, and
cucumbers in a month or so

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
earlier by covering them up.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So with this system, you
can use just the water egg

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:90%
pipe and the PVC pipe.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:90%
But we've used very heavy duty.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Our water pipe, it's very thick.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to last for years.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And we get blasted
with heavy wind

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.935 align:middle line:84%
here so the stuff that's
thin is going to blow over.

00:30:00.935 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:90%
This won't move.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So the whole reason for the
system is it's all movable.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:84%
We can pull these out and
then they're completely

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:90%
exposed to the elements.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Or we can just pop in
the hoops and the hoops

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
are just sitting inside
these PVC pipes, which are

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:90%
about 60 centimeters, 600 long.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.153 align:middle line:84%
And then just banged
into the soil.

00:30:25.153 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
system is completely

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
movable from bed to
bed because each bed

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:90%
has got the pipes in it.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So here's a hoops
system that was set up

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:90%
with agricultural cloth.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now this was originally
designed as a frost cloth.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It protects to about minus
four underneath the cloth.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It has a light shade
factor of around 17%, 18%.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It also creates a microclimate
to increase between four

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and six degrees underneath.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It stops wind damage.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Stops hail damage.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And if your crops
are small enough,

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you can, in fact,
leave it on all year.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We basically use it to
start the early seedlings.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, the
cucumbers, melons, things

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
like that that I can't
put out too early because

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.925 align:middle line:90%
of the risk of frost.

00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
You can plant them
out a little earlier

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.670 align:middle line:84%
now, a month or so earlier,
and just cover them with this.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
handle, very light.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But this is agricultural
cloth, as opposed

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to what you might buy
from some manufacturers

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and comes from China
is a frost cloth.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It looks a little
bit like tissue.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's really only good
for one or two seasons.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This is probably good
for five to seven years.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's really not much dearer
so it's a much better product.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.715 align:middle line:90%

00:31:45.715 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Brown onions-- now
this is something

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of gardeners don't
want to tackle because they

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:90%
think it's too hard.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one of the
easiest things to grow.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Brown onions actually
store quite a bit longer

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:90%
than red onions.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So brown onions are a great
option to grow quite a few

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and then keep them
over the winter.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.955 align:middle line:90%
But onions are extremely hardy.

00:32:10.955 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
These roots can dry out, their
tops can go yellow and break,

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and you can still plant them.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And they'll look
dead for a few weeks

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.102 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll start
to spring up, again.

00:32:21.102 --> 00:32:22.702 align:middle line:90%
So they're very, very hardy.

00:32:22.702 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm digging a hole, but all
you need to do is put a trench.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:84%
You can put them on
their side like that

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and the onion will bring itself
back up to being straight.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So onions is something
worth giving a go.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
You may have seen some
on our website or posts

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that we've done of our
onions that are this big.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the secret
to that is enough water.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And you give them enough
water and they swell.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:90%
So you want big onions?

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Plenty of water.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So with most of our
vegetables, we try and work

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:90%
on a rotation system.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:84%
These, for instance,
capsicums or sweet peppers,

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.470 align:middle line:90%
we grow four varieties.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's dependent
on varieties

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that come a little bit
earlier, ones in the middle,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and ones that come late so
we can extend the season

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the
same for the chilies.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're growing old
heirloom varieties,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:84%
the ones you don't get in
the shops that are hybrids.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
a little bit more

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:90%
erratic with their fruiting.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But you just can't beat the
flavor of the old heirlooms.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The modern hybrids
just don't compete.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
more unique ones, we

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.840 align:middle line:90%
perhaps only grow one or two of.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And this one's called
Purple Marconi.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a sweet pepper.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically,
almost black.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
It's got a beautiful
very dark sheen on it.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely sweet,
very productive.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great one
for the home gardener.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is our
perpetual spinach.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
This is a perennial,
as opposed to an annual

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:90%
for the other spinach varieties.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:90%
This one we can grow all year.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great backstop for
greens when some of the others

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:90%
aren't available.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:84%
So we actually grow a lot of
exotic and different greens

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that go into mixed salads.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And this one's a Bali
spinach from Bali,

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.770 align:middle line:90%
both in the red and the green.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And we use the immature
leaves, the sweeter

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.620 align:middle line:90%
leaves that aren't so tough.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:84%
And especially, the red one that
gives a lot of color to salads.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually part of
the amaranth family,

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:84%
but we generally don't let
it get any taller than this.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We're just taking the tips
off and the side shoots

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and using those in mixed salad.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Another unusual green
we use in mixed salads

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:90%
is the chrysanthemum.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a particular
type of chrysanthemum.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.790 align:middle line:90%
You can buy the seeds.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
It comes under the name
of an edible Asian green.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's not one that you grow
in the garden for it's flowers,

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.037 align:middle line:90%
but you keep this nice and low.

00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:24.870 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't let it get
any bigger than this.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
taking the tips out.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And they make a great
addition to salads

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:90%
with quite a unique flavor.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.845 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:90%


00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example of
one of the Asian greens,

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:90%
which we've let go to seed.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.345 align:middle line:84%
Because apart from
the unusual varieties

00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that we get from
other collectors

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and overseas of old heirloom
varieties and rare varieties

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that we grow every
year, the ones

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that we want to keep
and continue to grow,

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
the occasional plant
we let go to seed--

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.950 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they start to yellow,
we just put them on a tray

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:90%
for a week or so.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The pods open up, drop the seed,
and we'll use that next year.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So anyone can save seed from
open pollinated heirloom

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
varieties.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do that
with your modern hybrids

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
because they will
start to revert back

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:90%
to either one of the parents.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Now here's another great
addition to your salad,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.060 align:middle line:84%
both color-wise
and nutritionally,

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.610 align:middle line:90%
is beetroot leaves.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And they come in different
colors, in red, in green.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And very nutritious in
a smoothie and a juice.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's fine to harvest
about a third of the leaves

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:84%
on a beetroot and they'll
make exceptionally good juice.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is Tuscan kale.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And kale is a staple
ingredient in any smoothie.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And constantly used
in raw food salads

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's one of the most
nutritional foods you can get.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Now this kale, as opposed
to the Tuscan kale,

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:84%
which we use for salads
and green juicing,

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:90%
this is a curly kale.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And the curly kale is a
little bit tougher to eat raw.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to grow this to
make our dehydrated kale chips.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Because when you cover this in
the capsicum for the flavoring

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of the chips, it gets caught
in all the little nooks

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and crannies and
holds onto the paste.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And it dehydrates well
and becomes a great chip.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is curly kale or
Scotch kale and it's great

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:90%
for making those chips.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's an interesting
little plant

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:90%
called a Strawberry Spinach.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:84%
The leaves are picked and
used in salad, eaten fresh.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And as it matures, there's
little clusters of fruit all up

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:90%
the stems.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can throw them in your
dessert, your fruit salad.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
quite pleasant.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The seed for this
is available online.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:84%
You can buy it anywhere,
Strawberry Spinach.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Things like watermelons,
rock melons,

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
cantaloupes, you've got
to specifically grow what

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:90%
will grow well in your area.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And this, being down
south in Australia

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:84%
or in the north in
America, it's colder.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have the
same amount of warm days.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
get varieties which

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:90%
are specific to your area.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a very old heirloom
from the Navajo Indians.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.523 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually called
Navajo Winter Melon.

00:38:31.523 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the best,
for once it's cut,

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
it will store actually
for a month or two.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, a lot of
the other watermelons

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:90%
don't store that well.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It ripens 90, 95 days.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a great producer.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We've probably got 25 melons
off about 10 plants off this one

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.135 align:middle line:90%
this season.

00:38:51.135 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, the varieties
that are grown down here

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.628 align:middle line:84%
are things like sugar
baby and things like that.

00:38:55.628 --> 00:38:57.670 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
most readily available.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I've had no success
with those at all.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They're slow to crop.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
They grow too small.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%
They split when it rains.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You want to get a hold of some
of these really good heirloom

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
varieties, which are
specifically good for the area

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
that you live in.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Ones like this.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.355 align:middle line:84%
And you just got to go
online and do your research.

00:39:15.355 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You notice this one's more of
a pink color, it's still ripe.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't actually go bright
red, it stays a pink color.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions we get
asked the most about melons

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the home gardener
doesn't know when to pick them.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Now there's actually
four indicators

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.632 align:middle line:90%
that when a melon is ready.

00:39:39.632 --> 00:39:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if you pick
them too early,

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.860 align:middle line:84%
they won't ripen any
further and they're no good.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you pick
them too late, they

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:90%
get all dry and flowery inside.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just show you.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The first indicator--
and I do these in order--

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.960 align:middle line:84%
at the end of every
stem, where it

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:84%
joins the main
stem from the fruit

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
stem to the main stem
right at the axle,

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.840 align:middle line:84%
there is a small, what
we call, a spoon leaf--

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:90%
a small curled in leaf.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a tendril right
almost at the same point.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:84%
At the first leaf axle after
the stem is a curly tendril.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we look for is

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:84%
when that's green and not
brown, it's not ready.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
For it to be ripe, that needs
to be completely shriveled up

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:90%
or even dropped off.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The tendril is the second
thing I'll look at.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:84%
If that tendril is all
dried up, completely brown,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.500 align:middle line:90%
and that's gone.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The third thing at the
bottom of a ripe one,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
which I'll show you
in a minute, will

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:48.460 align:middle line:84%
have a yellow, not a white, but
a yellow or discolored patch

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They start going pale, then
cream, and then yellow.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
When that patch is yellow,
that indicates that it's ripe.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And also, by tapping it.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:84%
That is a method,
though, that you'd

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.197 align:middle line:84%
have to get used to after
growing them awhile.

00:41:02.197 --> 00:41:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a certain
sound and a vibration

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:84%
that a melon gives
off when it's ready.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:90%
So here's the indicators here.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Here's your spoon leaf,
all dried up, shriveled up.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And here's your tendril,
all dried, curled up.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We have a particular
vibration in there.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.851 align:middle line:84%
And there's a yellow
patch on the bottom.

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And with all three of
those things in play,

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:90%
this melons ripe, ready to pick.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.665 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:33.665 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.505 align:middle line:84%
Some people pick
their pumpkins early.

00:41:38.505 --> 00:41:40.630 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you're
going to get something hard.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.047 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that doesn't have

00:41:42.047 --> 00:41:43.375 align:middle line:90%
the correct amount of flavor.

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And remember, pumpkins will
actually mature and cure

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in a space of time
of about a month.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you pick these, store
them for about a month,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and they will improve
on their flavor

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:84%
than what they do when
they're actually picked fresh.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.140 align:middle line:84%
One point, though, if you're
going to pick them early, make

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:84%
sure that the stem is completely
browned off and gone old corky

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and brown so there's no longer
any nutrient going to it.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And when that's
completely died off,

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.310 align:middle line:84%
make sure you pick enough stem
on it right back to the vine.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that will improve
its storing quality.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
If you take the stem off and
it snaps off at the pumpkin,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.870 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely
to induce some rot.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I like to leave mine right
until the vines are looking

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:90%
pretty well dead or died off.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you
face when you do that

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.240 align:middle line:84%
is that you can
get them sunburnt.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And if you see--

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
this, say, you've got a
very hot day coming up

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're not protected,
especially later

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:84%
on in the year, some
of these exposed

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:84%
areas on very, very
hot days and high UV,

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.660 align:middle line:90%
these will actually get burnt.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens there is this
will be the first patch to rot.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And it won't store well at all.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And it will get soft
and squishy if it's left

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
you're rot will set in.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So I use little
squares of shade cloth.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter what color--
green, black, white.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you get them and get one
piece that'll go over the two

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.120 align:middle line:84%
or just cover them
like that, and that

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.910 align:middle line:84%
will protect all your pumpkins
from getting sunburnt.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're ready to harvest
these potatoes we planted.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And just one point
with these potatoes

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
people say you have

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to heal up around the potatoes
because the ones that come up

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:84%
from the top get the sunlight
on them and they go green.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.343 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
effective way of doing it.

00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But the other way of doing
it is as your potatoes grow,

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.660 align:middle line:84%
you just put more
mulch on top of them.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that keeps all the
potatoes with a cover on them

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
and they never go green.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's no green at
all on any of these.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And these ones are the ones that
are growing just on the surface

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:53.475 align:middle line:84%
because there's always
plenty of mulch.

00:43:53.475 --> 00:43:55.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, these brown onions
are ready to harvest.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is a variety
we've grown this year

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:90%
called Sweet Dominica.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell when an
onion is ready to harvest

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:09.490 align:middle line:84%
because it will naturally
bend and drop the green over.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And then once it does that,
it's ready to harvest.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Now that's an onion.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So we are growing both red
onions and the brown onions.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Once these are
all up, we'll just

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
leave them on the surface to
dry out for a couple of days.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And make sure they are dry
before you try and store them.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's been raining
and the skins are wet,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:90%
they'll only rot in storage.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So make sure that they dry out
completely with some warm air

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:84%
before you put them in a dark
room or in a bag for storage.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So now in late
autumn, when we've

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.660 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of our summer
crop still finishing up--

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the tomatoes are
finished, pumpkins

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.420 align:middle line:84%
are finishing up,
zucchinis, cucumber, peppers

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:90%
is slowing down--

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the time now
where we redo our beds.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.330 align:middle line:90%
We rip out the old ones.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:90%
We compost the material.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to dig
in composted cow manure,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.470 align:middle line:90%
our compost that we've made.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We dig in and we prepare the
beds for our spring planting.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The only exception
to that is some crops

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that we will overwinter,
which is some of the spinach

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and the perpetual spinach, the
rainbow chard, silver beet,

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and kale.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:90%
So our juicing grains.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:84%
We're preparing to
plant some more now,

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.618 align:middle line:84%
but we still have some
very vigorous bushes

00:45:30.618 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
growing at the moment so
they'll be overwintered.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll just feed those.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.158 align:middle line:90%
We'll mulch them.

00:45:36.158 --> 00:45:37.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll overwinter
them and we'll plant

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.783 align:middle line:90%
some new crops for spring.

00:45:38.783 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in the pumpkin
patch, the end of autumn.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:90%
The vines are dying off.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I
wouldn't pick them,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.230 align:middle line:84%
but if the stems
are woody and hard

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's no sap flow
anymore, you can pick them off.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:01.160 align:middle line:84%
We generally leave ours till
the vines die right off.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, they left out
with a little bit of sun

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of cold
nights for them to cure.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they've
cured, they then

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
go in a shed that's
got plenty of airflow,

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
just to make sure they've got
no excess moisture in them

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:18.560 align:middle line:90%
for about a month.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they get stored
in a dark storeroom.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the variety,
can last between three or four

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:90%
months right up to 12 months.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
pick days and then

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.000 align:middle line:84%
store them for two
months, what happens

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:90%
is the starches turn into sugar.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So a pumpkin that's been
stored for a month or two

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually sweeter than
one straight off the vine.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why we've put the
black fence around all our beds

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:90%
at here is twofold.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:84%
One, because we've got a rabbit
problem, a big rabbit problem.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And kangaroos.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And the second, most important,
is this is a windbreak cloth.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.020 align:middle line:84%
We get gusts of wind up
here on the unprotected side

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain from the
west and from the north.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And the windbreak cloth
actually breaks the wind down,

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
pushes it through the
fence, and disperses it

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:10.880 align:middle line:90%
instead of getting that gust.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two reasons
why we put up the fence.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
in this bed, we

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:84%
want to have a look
at this plant here.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, a Peruvian
root vegetable called yacon.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one of
the sunflower family.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But they're so sweet that
they're eaten raw in salads

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:84%
or you can stir fry them,
if you wish, or steam them.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But they are so sweet that
they called ground apple

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
they taste like.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
pumpkins, they actually

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
prefer once you've dogged
them up to leave them out

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:90%
in the sun for a few days.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And that actually helps
turn the starch into sugar

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.650 align:middle line:90%
so they get sweeter.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a look.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So as we can see, it's
all pushed up here.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.030 align:middle line:90%
The ground's bulging.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Starts off with one small
tuber with an eye on it

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and we end up with a whole
big bucket full of tubers.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, they're
absolutely everywhere.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we generally wait
for all the foliage

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to die off before we pick them,
but we'll just take one off

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have a look.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We actually store ours in
damp sand, bricklayer sand.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.925 align:middle line:84%
And we just put
them in a bucket,

00:48:32.925 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
put the sand around
them and they

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.000 align:middle line:84%
last for quite a few
months like that.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is once
you've taken the skin off,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.940 align:middle line:84%
you do this with a
vegetable peeler.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:56.580 align:middle line:84%
This part here is basically,
just like an apple.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Very, very sweet.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.814 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Here in the asparagus patch,
this time of the year--

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.810 align:middle line:84%
late autumn, the
start of winter--

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:90%
the foliage is all going yellow.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And we'll wait for that
to completely go yellow.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll remove
that, we'll compost it.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll put in another
load of fresh compost.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll cover that, again,
with sugarcane mulch.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll wait till spring and
the shoots start coming up.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now this is actually,
a second year crop.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:84%
When it comes up this spring,
it'll be its third year.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And we'll start to harvest it.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you don't
harvest them prior to that

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is because the plants
are needing this foliage

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to take in all the
nutrients and from the sun

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and grow the roots to
being big healthy roots.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:84%
If you start taking
off the asparagus

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.790 align:middle line:84%
shoots as they come
up, there isn't

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.760 align:middle line:84%
anything to absorb those
nutrients back into the ground.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good idea to leave
them for the first two years

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:90%
before your harvest.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
year, harvest sparingly.

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And then after that, you're OK

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Previously, we'd probably
only take about 50%

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of the crop, the rest of
the foliage we leave on.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
A well-maintained and
well-looked after asparagus

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.670 align:middle line:84%
patch will see you with
plenty of asparagus

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:90%
for at least 20 years.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.080 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
health, both our health

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.915 align:middle line:84%
and the health of the soil,
it all comes down to biology.

00:50:29.915 --> 00:50:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just briefly talk
about biology of the soil.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Just 1 teaspoon, 5 grams
of healthy organic soil

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:50.110 align:middle line:84%
can hold over 1 billion
bacteria, over 5 million fungi,

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:55.420 align:middle line:84%
thousands of protozoa, and
many, many beneficial nematodes.

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That all combine to
make the soil food web.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The soil food web is
the critical interaction

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:84%
between all of those
elements in the soil that

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.900 align:middle line:84%
create the environment
that protects and nourishes

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.060 align:middle line:90%
the plants naturally.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.630 align:middle line:84%
As far as we're concerned,
we're told all the time

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:20.970 align:middle line:84%
about the benefits of
beneficial bacteria in our gut.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And that bacteria that we
rely on for our own health

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and to sustain our
own immune system

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:34.010 align:middle line:84%
feeds on the cellulose
fiber from plant material.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in our everyday
life of eating foods packaged,

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:84%
canned, cooked in
an unhealthy way,

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:84%
processed, and other
things that we're not

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.880 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be eating.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Impacted by the water we
drink because the water

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
we have through our mains
water system is treated.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's treated for
one reason and that's

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:56.870 align:middle line:90%
the kill bacteria in the water.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So when we ingest that water,
it does exactly the same to us.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And it kills
billions and billions

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of beneficial bacteria.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.250 align:middle line:90%
So we find ourselves depleted.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So that need is fulfilled
by companies producing

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in laboratories, beneficial
bacteria of one or two strains,

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:90%
usually grown on dairy products.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do the same thing
as a balanced diet when we're

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:28.120 align:middle line:84%
provided and feeding millions
of beneficial bacteria

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.180 align:middle line:84%
on a holistic scope, instead
of just swallowing one or two

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:90%
strains of bacteria.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we're taking in only
one or two strains of bacteria

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:40.280 align:middle line:84%
instead of the whole spectrum,
that's not a holistic approach.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is that
standard agricultural

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and conventional farming
practices have not

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.290 align:middle line:90%
looked after the soil.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
are practices which

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.280 align:middle line:90%
come along before they plant.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.450 align:middle line:84%
They cover and
fumigate the soil which

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:58.360 align:middle line:90%
kills everything living in it.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting
from a position of soil

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.430 align:middle line:90%
that is no longer living.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
we plant the plant.

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:07.600 align:middle line:90%
We feed the plant.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.580 align:middle line:84%
We feed it on three
main nutrients,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
a NPK, so-called,
balanced fertilizer.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:17.890 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact, the soil
when it's in its own balance

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.060 align:middle line:84%
provides over 50
nutrients to the plants.

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But we artificially
feed them with three

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
to get ongoing growth, to
get some root structure,

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and to get production of fruit.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we only have three

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't have the
other elements to provide

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:84%
the plant with enough
nutrients naturally

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:90%
to build its own immune system.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it
can't fight disease.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It can't fight off
pest and insect attack.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then is that
we have to treat them, again,

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.570 align:middle line:84%
with artificial chemicals for
the funguses, for the insects,

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and for all the
problems that we have

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that the soil can
then not cope with.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So once the populations of
beneficial bacteria and fungi

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:12.040 align:middle line:84%
are affected, the soil structure
is dramatically depleted.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.210 align:middle line:84%
As the soil structure
collapses, the poor spices

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:84%
get smaller and the
soil begins to compact.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In turn, the air exchange
and the moisture availability

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to the roots is
greatly declined.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And this then causes
anaerobic conditions,

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:37.150 align:middle line:84%
in which bad bacteria
and disease can flourish.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria live in
water, which means

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:44.320 align:middle line:84%
they live in the moist membrane
surrounding the soil particles.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Most beneficial
bacteria require oxygen

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're called
aerobic bacteria.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria that don't
require oxygen, the bad ones,

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:01.480 align:middle line:90%
are called anaerobic bacteria.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can not only have
problems with poor soil moisture

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:84%
content, both not
getting enough,

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.060 align:middle line:84%
but we can also have a
problem with the structure

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:84%
of the soil is so poor
that water will sit there

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and won't drain.

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:84%
That causes another problem,
whereas the excess moisture

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.570 align:middle line:84%
forces out the
oxygen. And again,

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:29.380 align:middle line:84%
promotes the growth
of anaerobic bacteria.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Mycorrhizal fungi have
a symbiotic relationship

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.680 align:middle line:90%
with the soil.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And a symbiotic
relationship is simply,

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:84%
a relationship that benefits the
plant and benefits the fungi.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So the mycorrhizal fungi
live partly in the soil

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and partly on the little hairs
on the roots of the plant.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And between the whole system,
it talks to each other about

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
what's required,
what's needed, what's

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in the soil, what
the plant can use.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The fungi helps assist
the uptake of nutrients

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:06.970 align:middle line:90%
from the soil to the plant.

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And in return, the plant feeds
the fungi with carbohydrates.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the main nutrients
we use as home gardeners

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:84%
or the commercial farmers use is
nitrogen. The problem with that

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is when we don't
grow holistically,

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:84%
when we don't grow organically,
nitrogen is a problem.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It locks up in the soil.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The truth is there is
no nitrogen deficiency

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.850 align:middle line:90%
in healthy soil at all.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to add
nitrogen. And, in fact,

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the more you throw on there,
which is chemical nitrogen,

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the more it gets fixed in
the soil and doesn't release.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Natural nitrogen is broken
down and fed to plants

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:54.820 align:middle line:84%
through things like
mycorrhizal fungi.

00:56:54.820 --> 00:57:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The problem when you don't
have the biology in the soil

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:04.190 align:middle line:84%
is that nitrogen sits
there, it gets locked up.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it gets
released into the atmosphere,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:11.480 align:middle line:90%
causing the greenhouse effect.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And we keep pouring more and
more on because the plants

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.090 align:middle line:90%
aren't getting it.

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because it's
not in the soil,

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
but because we don't
have the biology

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.580 align:middle line:84%
to work that
symbiotic relationship

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.180 align:middle line:84%
with natural nitrogen,
natural uptake

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.790 align:middle line:84%
through natural
organisms in the soil.

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the relationship
that the mycorrhizal fungi has

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.650 align:middle line:90%
with plants is similar to ours.

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Both fungi and ourselves, we
don't produce any chlorophyll.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We need it, but we
don't produce it.

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Plants produce that
through the sun

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.550 align:middle line:84%
through photosynthesis,
that is their energy source.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We, just like the fungi,
require carbohydrates, an energy

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:57.580 align:middle line:90%
source.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the plants
and the mycorrhizal fungi

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.890 align:middle line:84%
work together in that
symbiotic relationship.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And what is, indeed,
intended for us

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.640 align:middle line:84%
in nature's grand
plan for everything

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we also
work symbolically

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:19.670 align:middle line:84%
with plants to get what we
require in the way of energy.

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So the problem that we
have with modern farming

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:25.970 align:middle line:84%
is we've taken on the
idea that we can actually

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:28.830 align:middle line:90%
improve on nature.

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:32.330 align:middle line:84%
That what's been happening
for billions of years on Earth

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:34.760 align:middle line:90%
in a system that is foolproof--

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.200 align:middle line:84%
it works itself, it
feeds everything itself,

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.390 align:middle line:90%
it resolves it issues itself--

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and yet, we've come
along with a quick fix

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to throw chemicals on the
ground, one or two chemicals,

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to get a little pushing growth
and a little bit of this

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit of that.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The problem is without
that holistic approach,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.080 align:middle line:84%
it eventually ends
up with problems.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to watching how
nature does it in the bush,

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle,
out in the fields.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It looks after itself.

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So all we do is feed the
soil with what is natural.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And we use grass
clippings, leaf mold,

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.300 align:middle line:84%
composted materials like
sticks, vegetable scraps, animal

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.400 align:middle line:90%
manures.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.770 align:middle line:90%
They all go in a pile.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the bacteria that
heats it up, breaks it down.

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You got a massive diversity
of bacteria and fungi

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in those compost piles.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:43.540 align:middle line:84%
The pathogens have
been killed by the heat

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:46.140 align:middle line:90%
so they're no longer dangerous.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The weed seeds have
been killed by the heat

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.490 align:middle line:84%
so all you have is this
perfectly constructed

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:55.090 align:middle line:90%
by nature plant food.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It feeds the soil.

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:58.330 align:middle line:90%
The soil feeds the plant.

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And everything
works automatically,

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.700 align:middle line:90%
the way nature intended.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The other point is
that when you are

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
feeding your soils with
the best material you can,

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.570 align:middle line:90%
which is compost--

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:13.960 align:middle line:84%
whether that's with grass
clippings, vegetable peels--

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.590 align:middle line:84%
whatever you've
got, it's all great.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to heat
up with the bacteria.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to break down.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It is all fantastic
food for your soil.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But the key to real
health is diversity.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you do go into the forest
and you turn over some topsoil

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and you see that those white
fungal spores that are growing,

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
you take a handful of
that, you bring it back,

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
you put it in your
compost pile, now

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
millions of diverse varieties
of bacteria and fungi

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't have
in your compost pile

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.030 align:middle line:84%
will now breed in
your compost pile.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So by bringing
from other sources,

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
material into your compost
pile is a great thing.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It builds diversity.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the
effect is the more,

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the merrier as far as beneficial
bacterial mycorrhizal fungi

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:04.720 align:middle line:90%
goes.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually producing
a more richer, diverse product

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
that feeds your soil better.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you can
do with those compost

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is instead of putting
it on the soil

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and letting it
break down slowly,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
there is another
way of increasing

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the beneficial bacteria
of mycorrhizal fungi

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.280 align:middle line:90%
at a phenomenal rate.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is with what
we call compost tea.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I suggest that you
look up compost tea,

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
there are lots of
different recipes.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one day soon, I hope
to put one up on our web page.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But what that is, is
we're taking compost,

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
we're putting it in a bag.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
We're putting it in
a vat or a container

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
with oxygen and
oxygen is the key.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We're bubbling that solution
full of clean water, not tap

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
water or you'll actually
kill the bacteria.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So tank water, or rain
water, or tap water

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that has been gassed
off, which means

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
the chlorine and the
chemicals are gassed off

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
by bubbling them for 24 hours.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So that gets rid
of the chemicals

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.300 align:middle line:90%
if you have to use tap water.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is
24 hours, 30 hours,

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
depending on the temperature--
a little bit longer in cooler

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
temperatures, a little
bit shorter in warmer

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.860 align:middle line:90%
temperatures--

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:29.377 align:middle line:84%
the ideal is somewhere around
20 to 24 degrees is fantastic.

01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But you can do it
at any time, it just

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
takes longer in the cold,
shorter time in the heat.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're bubbling this
brew for that length of time.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is in the light
paint strainer bag, one that

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
has a very, very small micron
so that the soil doesn't all

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
get washed out, it allows
the bacteria and the fungi

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to come through the
bag into the solution.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Bubbles with the
oxygen. And they

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are reproducing
billions and billions

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:03.820 align:middle line:90%
at a phenomenal hourly rate.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So what you have then at the
end is a product, a tea, which

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.720 align:middle line:90%
you can spray on your foliage.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It protects the foliage,
the plant from bad bacteria.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
It protects it
from mold, fungus.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a great inoculate for both
for the plant and for the soil.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So it feeds and inoculates,
both at the same time.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to get
into that research

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
a little bit on
compost tea and you

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
will find immediate
results with compost tea,

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and that just aids the whole
system of organic gardening.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So you've got your slow
composting process,

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
where the soil bacteria pulling
down the nutrients over time

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
as it breaks down
on the soil surface.

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you're immediately
feeding and inoculating

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.600 align:middle line:90%
with something like compost tea.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Give that a go.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:11.990 align:middle line:90%
