00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Couple of days of meds.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Since you said he was suicidal,
I took him to the hospital

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.932 align:middle line:90%
and put them all in there.

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you really
wanted to commit suicide,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing I
could do about it,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't going
to make it easy.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This all started off with
a bad relationship and some

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
tests, anxiety and
stress in grad school.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And now, I am a totally
dysfunctional, highly suicidal

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that's
happened between then

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and now is I've been
exposed to a series of very

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%
strong psychiatric medications.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, medicines
are given like candy.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Patients are seeing
doctors for five minutes

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:90%
and they're given a pill.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:10%
It's my belief that many of
the medications that doctors

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.165 align:middle line:10%
are giving to patients today
are more harmful than helpful

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:27.965 align:middle line:10%
to those patients.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:10%
>> They want that pill that
they hope will take care

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:10%
of their problem
thoroughly and rapidly.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And most of these medications
will actually do that very well

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:90%
in the short term.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
In the short term,
they really work.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is in the long
term they're mostly disastrous.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sick.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with me.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
This is just damage to
my nervous system cause

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
from a properly
taken prescribed drug

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:90%
that a doctor told me was safe.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing safe
about this drug.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> This is crazy.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:10%
It's very clear to me after
having studied the science

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:10%
that the way we use
psychiatric drugs

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:10%
do vastly more harm than good.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember driving my niece
to school and I was like,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
all the kids are
going to be murdered.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.303 align:middle line:84%
And then like that thought
created adrenaline.

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So then when the adrenaline
kicked, I was like, oh my god,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
am I going to be the
one that does it?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, yeah,
you're going to kill these kids.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like, I'm sitting
here looking at my niece,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
like I can't-- and the
thoughts are so bad that like

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
you're like teeth chatter.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my god,
I'm capable of that?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.702 align:middle line:90%
I was never like this.

00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the scariest
part, because I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
don't know is this my normal--

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%
like did Efexor do this to me?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Did Cymbalta do this to me?

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Did Geodon?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Abilify?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.047 align:middle line:90%

>> I was very
successful academically.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I got accepted into the Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
After Annapolis,
I did a few years

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
on a destroyer based
out of Mayport, Florida.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
at sea, you're

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:84%
training to be the guy directing
the ship where to navigate,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:90%
where to go.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It's great fun, but it's
also extremely high stress.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:90%
But I loved it.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I was preselected for
satellite systems engineering.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:10%
Part of that was
going to grad school.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
When I got the acceptance
letter from MIT,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.185 align:middle line:84%
it was one of those moments
where you're just like,

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
this is not happening.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
It must be a mistake.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
But then stars have aligned
and I was really happy.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Fall semester went
off without a hitch.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I had started a
romantic relationship

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:90%
earlier that summer.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The early spring is when
things started to fall apart.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
My romantic relationship kind
of took a turn, became toxic.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I was in distress.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.772 align:middle line:90%
I was overwhelmed.

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
We were taking upwards of
four to five graduate level

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:90%
courses a semester.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I sought out care
from the mental health clinic

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
at MIT, the campus clinic.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Presented solution
to my problems

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
was a prescription for
the benzodiazepine Ativan,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
which I'd never previously
known about or taken.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And Zoloft.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
They work as advertised.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very
immediate effect.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very calming.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Dave told me probably on our
third or fourth date that he

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
was on medication for
depression and ADHD.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I have ADHD myself and
take medication for that.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I had issues with depression and
sought out help and medication

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and counseling, and it's
kind of fairly normal now.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.925 align:middle line:90%
>> I met the girl of my dreams.

00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I got engaged
during that period.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Work was great.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Loved it.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Back to my normal what I
thought was my normal self.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in the eight
month time range,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
emotional flatness,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
some sexual dysfunction,
difficulty remembering

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:90%
what street we lived on.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.747 align:middle line:84%
That whole period is just a
blur, like I was a zombie.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I have this big wedding planned.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking to
my mom prior to it.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I was-- mom, I just--

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I feel nothing.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I feel emotionally
void of anything.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I went to
the psychiatrist and said,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
this is-- the
stuff isn't for me.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:90%
I need to get off it.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:90%
I think the drug is my problem.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
That's really when
shit hit the fan.

a child.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I love school.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I like to be with
my friends a lot.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel very comforted just
being around other people.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
When I was 11 years old,
I moved from Nashville

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:90%
to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We moved a lot for my
parents' various jobs

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
which is very hard in terms of
keeping like lifelong friends.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I would oftentimes just like sit
in my room and listen to music

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and just like, honestly, just
kind of mope, mope around.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I started having a lot
of anxiety about school

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and I was so anxious I
got these stomach aches

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't want to eat.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't eat breakfast
because I had a stomach ache.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't eat much lunch
because I had a stomach ache.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed that she'd
gotten kind of thin.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I just kind of blurt it out.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you
might be anorexic?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
She went and got on
the scale and she said,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I think I lost 20 pounds.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I just totally freaked
out and got an appointment

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:10%
same day.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%

the therapist asked me to come

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:90%
into the room.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, I think
what would really

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
be best to kickstart
this treatment is for her

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to get on antidepressants.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.543 align:middle line:84%
Wait a second, we came here
for the talk therapy, right?

00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We didn't come here to
kickstart it with medication.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole point of going
to a therapist, I thought.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Rebecka was prescribed
Zoloft for the first medication.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
She said it didn't
really make a difference.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel any better
but she also didn't really

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
feel any worse at that time.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So when we saw her
doctor again, the doctor

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:90%
switched her to Prozac.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after, I
had a business trip.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I got a phone
call from Rebecka,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "You know, I've
been seeing this little girl".

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
do you mean you've

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
been seeing a little girl?

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, like she's not really
there but like I can see her

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and I named her Alice.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I genuinely thought

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
in the room that weren't there,
that people could also see

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
but they were very real for me.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> She came into our bedroom
late at night and she was

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%
shaking.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
She said the hallucination
touched me and asked

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
me to come into the kitchen
so I could hurt myself.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
>> And they said,
oh enough of this.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.790 align:middle line:90%
She needs-- she needs help.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a waitress
in New York City.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Pretty normal girl doing normal
things, nothing exceptional,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
nothing not exceptional,
just normal.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:90%
My mind was clear.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I was happy.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:10%
The only little issue I
had was I couldn't sleep.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll get out at 2:00,
3:00 in the morning

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
so I knew that my
sleep issues were

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:90%
related to working nighttime.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my doctor,
just my regular doctor.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I see him maybe twice a year.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him for
something for sleep.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:10%
He gave me a referral,
and I took the referral

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:10%
and I called a bunch of
psychiatrists and this one

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:10%
doctor in Brooklyn said,
yeah, we're seeing patients.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a prescription
for Lorazepam.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
He told me to take two in
the day and two at night.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I then said, why would I
need to take a sleeping

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:90%
pill during the day?

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
sleep during the day.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
is how it works.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even people
could have sleep issues

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.927 align:middle line:84%
because I was sleeping
normal all my life.

00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something
I thought about.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So but I had a
feeling it was my job.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't think
I could quit my job.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I thought I could
get help for it.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
That's how I went
to a psychiatrist.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And he prescribed me
this drug, Lorazepam.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I took it for six years and--

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait, you took
Lorazepam for six years?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Six-- six and a half years.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Unfortunately, that's the
problem that most pharmacists

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:10%
see with Lorazepam.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Lorazepam, again, if the
doctor takes the time out

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to read the package
insert, it clearly states--

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they not reading?

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That, I don't know.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I can only tell you what I read.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The use of benzodiazepine
has increased tremendously

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Since they've been around
for such a long time,

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of doctors have
forgotten about the side

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
effects and the possible
dangers of these medications.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:84%
None of them were ever
meant for long term use.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But everybody knows
somebody who's

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.965 align:middle line:84%
been taking
benzodiazepine for years.

00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I started thinking like,
OK, when did this start?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:10%
How did this start?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:90%
What led up to me falling apart?

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.537 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was the go-to
person in my unit always.

00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
If they needed a job done and
they needed it done right,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:90%
they would ask me.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I was physically
fit, knew my job,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I got promoted to sergeant.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
After work, I was
like a lot of fun.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.825 align:middle line:84%
I like to travel, go to
the beach, spontaneous.

00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I was just like the happy
person, like the happy go lucky

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:90%
friend.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:90%
Like, hey, let's go shopping.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to a bakery.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- never had a second
thought about anything crazy.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:90%
That's who I was before this.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So when the war started,
I think most of it

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
was stressful
situations every day.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Like being shot at on
convoys, just driving around

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:90%
in dangerous areas of Baghdad.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Your head was like
constantly scanning

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:90%
for something dangerous.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Be a strong sergeant,
I don't take no shit

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
that's just the way I was.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But like the first two
months I was in Baghdad,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:90%
like I'm really, really sick.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I had nosebleeds,
fainting, dizziness.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I lost like 40 pounds so they
medivac-ed me out of Iraq.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Then my convoy got hit the
day after I got medevac-ed.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw the
kid come back in

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and he was one of my
soldiers, and I felt horrible.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And like that was the day that
I saw psychiatry with the arrow

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and I walked straight there
because that's what you do.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.463 align:middle line:90%
And they put me on Klonopin.

00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:90%
That's how this all started.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:10%
>> They're trained while
they're on active duty very,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:10%
very systematically that if
you come back and you have

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:10%
problems, you need
to go to the doctor.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago if they had
this kind of a trauma,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
would talk to their
fellow soldiers,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.055 align:middle line:84%
talk to their parents,
talk to their friends,

00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
talk to their pastor.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And instead, they're
going to their doctor

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and getting medicated.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think the Klonopin
was starting to make me worse

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
but they just kept telling
me that's what PTSD is.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
You have PTSD now.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember he
looked at me and he said,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
the proceedings

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:90%
for medical retirement.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
You are not able to be around
soldiers and no weapons.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling like,
how was I like super soldier

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm disabled at 25?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.693 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a post-traumatic
stress and it's a problem.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So we would never argue with
you that it is not a problem.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It is a problem.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a big problem.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.265 align:middle line:84%
But for you, it's
not a mental illness.

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I feel like I'm
waking up from a nightmare.

00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Like what the fuck just
happened to my life?

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.712 align:middle line:90%
>> You lost years of your life.

00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:90%
You lost your career.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
There's just so many things
that are losses in here.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the situation
that we're in right now

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:90%
as a culture.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Is that if you run to the
doctor and cry about this,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say, oh
you have major depression

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to stick
you on the next pill instead

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:90%
of saying, hey, you know what?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Suffering is the
only normal response.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:90%
There's a grief process.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah-- yeah--

00:13:29.138 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That you have to go through.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.606 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Normals and danger.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:10%
The definitions
used in psychiatry

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:10%
and even more the
way they're applied

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:10%
have become so wide that
a far too large percentage

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:10%
of the population
would be defined

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:10%
as having a mental disorder.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.133 align:middle line:10%
>> Now we have patients come in
and if they're anxious or they

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:10%
can't sleep or they have
some kind of physical pain,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:10%
it's like oh my gosh, know
let's get rid of that.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:90%
We have really vilified pain.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking emotional
pain, physical pain,

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
like it has now become the
responsibility of the doctor

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate all
suffering at all costs.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> There is a cultural context.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:10%
And the context really
goes back to the arrival

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:10%
of antibiotics in the late 1940s
and then the polio vaccine.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%
They really do change life.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Bacterial infections
are no longer a problem

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and now we have this
magic cure for polio.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.238 align:middle line:84%
So now, we believe
in magic bullets.

00:14:25.238 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, we're
going to be having

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.789 align:middle line:90%
magic bullets for everything.

in psychiatrist,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:10%
you trace its history,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
American psychiatry
was in competition

with other therapists--
talk therapy, counselors,

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:90%
social workers.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%
What do they say to themselves?

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They say we need to
present ourselves

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
as doctors, as medical doctors.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:90%
We need to put on a white coat.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They adopt a disease
model for categorizing

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:90%
psychiatric disorder.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to say
these are diseases

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, illnesses of
the brain that are drugs,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
therefore, treat the
symptoms of those illnesses.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It centers on this
chemical imbalance

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.615 align:middle line:90%
theory of mental disorders.

00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:10%
>> While the cause is unknown,
depression may be related

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:10%
to an imbalance of natural
chemicals between nerve cells

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:10%
in the brain.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Prescription Zoloft works
to correct this imbalance.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:10%
When you know more
about what's wrong,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:10%
you can help make it right.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:10%
>> It hasn't been possible to
demonstrate that first you have

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:10%
a chemical imbalance,
and then because of that,

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:10%
you become depressed
or psychotic.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But what we have shown
is that the drugs

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:90%
create a chemical imbalance.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has a clue
what happens when

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
you push this system somewhere.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You have all sorts of
reactions elsewhere.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very naive thought
that a psychiatric disorder

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
is based on one single thing
chemically that went wrong,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and then we have a
quick fix for that.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.365 align:middle line:90%
It's totally, totally naive.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1980, the American
Psychiatric Association adopted

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
a disease model and began to
tell that story to the American

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:90%
public.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You know who was so
happy with that story?

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:90%
The pharmaceutical industry.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
They were thrilled
with this story

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
because now they could
see markets expanding.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Depression, anxiety,
all these things

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that we use to think of as
sort of normal fluctuations

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in human experience could
now be seen as illnesses,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
therefore you could treat
with drugs and they said wow.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Binge-eating Disorder or
BED isn't just overeating.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:10%
It's a real medical condition.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:10%
Certain chemicals in the
brain may play a role.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.548 align:middle line:10%
BED is also the most common
eating disorder in US adults.

00:17:10.548 --> 00:17:13.038 align:middle line:90%

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.567 align:middle line:84%
>> I never really thought that
the medication was a bad thing.

00:17:25.567 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah, this is
going to make me feel better.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.373 align:middle line:84%
OK, if this other one's going
to make me feel better, awesome.

00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if these four are going
to make me feel better, great,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:90%
let's do it.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:90%
I will try anything.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There was never any notion
that the medication was causing

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:90%
these symptoms.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It was more like the
disease was developing.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The only warning
she sort of gave,

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
but she was very dismissive
about it, was you might hear,

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Green, that
in some instances,

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
people who are on
antidepressants might have

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:84%
suicidal thoughts, but this
really isn't something you

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
should be overly
concerned about.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> She said kind of almost
flippantly, like, oh,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
lock up your knives.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.015 align:middle line:90%
So we went out and bought--

00:18:07.015 --> 00:18:08.532 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> A lock box and put
anything dangerous in there.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's really when it kind
of sunk in even more, like,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
wow, this is serious.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was hospitalized that
first time when I was 13.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But over the course
of a year, I think

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I was hospitalized seven
times, seven, eight times.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Leaving her in the hospital,
a psychiatric hospital, I mean,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.247 align:middle line:90%
this was not our life.

00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
This was not our daughter.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.205 align:middle line:90%
We knew our daughter.

00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We knew, I mean, a
few months before,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
she had been sort of a
little depressed, melancholy,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
but this was a far
leap from that.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And once in the
hospital there,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
they added an antipsychotic
because she was now

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
experiencing
psychotic behaviors.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In addition, they had to
prescribe another medication

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to take care of the known side
effects of the antipsychotic.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really
know what else to do

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:90%
when we were in the system.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to trust the experts.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:90%
So we went that route.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> My mind was just filled
with horrible thoughts about me

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and about how horrible I was
and how much I hated myself.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is even the point
of me being here anymore?

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Many, many people are
getting an antidepressant,

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
an antipsychotic,
a benzodiazepine,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and a sleep medicine
without any rhyme or reason.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the
beneficial effects

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of these different
medicines adding up

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to something
wonderful, very often,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:84%
their harmful effects add
up to something terrible.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got out of the Army
and went to the VA system,

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
it was like a whole
other ballgame.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It turned into like,
cocktails of antipsychotic,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:90%
antidepressant, benzo.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say to the clinician,
I don't have good feelings.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:84%
All I just feel is numb
or anxious or depressed.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever feel happy
or grateful or loving.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.912 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, we'll just
add another medicine.

00:20:05.912 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that one's not working.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So then we'll switch
to a different one.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically, my
medication history

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.058 align:middle line:84%
is just a succession of,
oh, this doesn't work?

00:20:14.058 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's go all the way
up to the highest dose

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, it didn't work.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, come back down.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.362 align:middle line:84%
OK, that didn't work, so let's
switch it and try another one.

00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like a hamster wheel that
I never got off of until now.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:10%
>> What happens to someone like
Angie is that when they get

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:10%
on these medications and
they begin to deteriorate,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:10%
the attribution is to their
mental condition as opposed

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:10%
to the medication.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
go in and they say,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
well, you gave me
an antidepressant,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm really
depressed, then

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, I see your
depression is worsening,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and so they up it
or add a medication.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Next thing, you're on--
they're on uppers and downers

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.255 align:middle line:84%
and, I mean, you just
see this pattern.

00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And every time they go in,
it's their deteriorating

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
mental condition instead of
somebody saying, your drug

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:90%
may be your problem.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.964 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:13.678 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi!

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to see you.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:90%

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for coming.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's awesome to be here.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.465 align:middle line:84%
I'm so nervous,
because I can't talk

00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:90%
like this at my own school.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just run through
my story quickly, and then just

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
talk, because I'm sure you
have really cool questions.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I was on a cocktail of
17 medications at once,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and then, basically,
from 2006 to 2016,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
it took me all that time to
get off of everything else.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So every time you went in,
and you were prescribed some

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
of these medications, what
were you told about the side

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:90%
effects?

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
How much information
were you given

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
before you were prescribed
this medication?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In the office, you have 10
minutes with the psychiatrist.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.125 align:middle line:84%
So then they're like, so
how are you feeling today?

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you're like, well,
I'm still really anxious

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't sleep last week.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And and then they're
like, well, I

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
want you to take
this little quiz.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel jumpy in public?

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.505 align:middle line:90%
Do you spend time with friends?

00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It was just one of those
psychological assessments,

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just filling
out the little test,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and they take the test, and
see him pull out the DSM,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and then he's like,
oh, yeah, you have

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:90%
generalized anxiety disorder.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what is another
label going to do for me now?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Like, really?

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Another label.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have addict, PTSD,
generalized anxiety,

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
panic disorder with
agoraphobia, major depression,

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:90%
like, for what?

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:10%
What does any of those
labels do for me?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.663 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing everything
that you tell me to do,

00:22:37.663 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not getting better.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So the most hurtful
part of all of this

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that I want you to listen to
is that I did all the therapy,

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I saw social workers,
therapists, psychiatrists,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
psychologists, not
once did somebody say,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
it could be your meds.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Not once in 13 years.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:90%
That is what hurts me the most.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm in
social work school.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I have all A's.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.005 align:middle line:90%
My brain is coming back.

00:23:02.005 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I can write a mean APA paper.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about a lot
of these meds that are being

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
prescribed for four to six years
should only be taken for a few

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
weeks.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's ever
a place for medications,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.702 align:middle line:84%
or would you ever
hold someone's hand

00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:90%
through that decision process?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> At the beginning,
I was anti-med.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Like, no way.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Hell no.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm lucky that I didn't
kill myself or someone else.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So how can I say, oh, go ahead,
take those meds, you know?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is times
when some people--

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and when I say some,
I mean very few.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not anti-med.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm pro informed consent.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you, as a
social worker, want

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.875 align:middle line:84%
to talk to them about
informed consent,

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that is well within
our boundaries.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:90%
We get it for a surgery.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we
getting it for meds?

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You shared that you're
very uncomfortable with all

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:90%
the labels you've been given.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
If you could change that label
to something, what would you?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I just think I was in--
like, I was just scared.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.795 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was just scared a
little girl that was 24.

00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.923 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to be so
complicated, you know?

00:24:07.923 --> 00:24:10.881 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was first diagnosed with
ADHD when I was 15, I think.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember it being a
relief to get the diagnosis.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.351 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, OK.

00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:90%
That's why everything's so hard.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not that I'm stupid.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not that I'm lazy.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty severely depressed.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I couldn't go to school.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:90%
I just cried all the time.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, just kind of a mess.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
At that point, then, I
was put on Dexedrine.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I felt a ton better and
was able to go to school

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:90%
I felt some hope again.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I hear anecdotes that vary,
anecdotes of the great effects

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
of drugs.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:10%
And I would say that's about
20%, 25% of anecdotes I hear.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This has really
been great for me.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:84%
This has helped me through
a very difficult time.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
About 40% saying, it
may have helped some.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to tell what
exactly it was doing.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't say it hurt me.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Can't say it helped me.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
I seem kind of indifferent
to what it may have done.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, I get the other 30%
or 35% saying, this hurt me.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:90%
This damaged me.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the anecdotes
I've been hearing.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
details a little bit

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:84%
what you find in the
literature out there.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason that I kind of
changed the way I practice was

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
the realization that I was
actually harming my patients.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It is very clear that there
is a cohort of patients

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
for whom getting off of these
drugs is exquisitely painful.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When Dave decided
to go off the meds,

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I think he probably didn't share
it with me because he knew that

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
they worked for me and they
were successful for me,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:84%
but that wasn't
the case for him.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> She knew something
was different.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.122 align:middle line:90%
She knew something was wrong.

00:26:18.122 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I was having a lot
of irritability,

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of difficulty
communicating,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.667 align:middle line:84%
so it put a lot of stress
on our relationship,

00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and we just didn't
talk about it much.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I was the
worst wife in the world,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what was going on.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:10%
And every day, driving
home, I was like, OK,

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:10%
what can I do differently?

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And about, I would
say, four weeks later,

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
he shared with me that
he had taken himself

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:90%
off the medication.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:10%
And that was a
huge relief to me.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.391 align:middle line:10%
OK, it's not me.

00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, he just became
short and irritable

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:10%
and he wasn't positive anymore.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:10%
Everything was negative.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I was totally dysfunctional
and began experiencing what

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:10%
I'll call this irrational
terror-like level of anxiety

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:10%
that I had never
previously experienced.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd come home from work,
and I found him on the kitchen

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:10%
floor curled up in a ball
just sobbing and rocking.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Didn't want anybody to touch
him, be anywhere near him.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:10%
He'd go find a place
to go hide in the house

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:10%
and just sob uncontrollably.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
It was really,
really hard to see.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I got to a point where I
wholesale refused to consume

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
any more drugs, and that kind
of came to a head several months

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, right
now, we're separated.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The breaking point for
me deciding to move out,

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.830 align:middle line:90%
there was a couple of things.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
He is of the mindset that
it's just going to take time

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
that you can do.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, here's
what the options that I see.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:01.383 align:middle line:84%
They're mostly medical-based,
and he's absolutely refused.

00:28:01.383 --> 00:28:03.675 align:middle line:84%
>> I explained my entire
background to my psychiatrist.

00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I said look, I took pride
in being in the Navy.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I took pride in surviving
and making it through MIT

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and had high hopes to do
good things for the Navy

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.142 align:middle line:84%
and for the country, and
now, I don't know who I am.

00:28:16.142 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that's
happened between then

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and now is I've been
exposed to a series of very

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:90%
strong psychiatric medications.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.353 align:middle line:84%
And the answer after
20 minutes was, well,

00:28:25.353 --> 00:28:27.145 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a
prescription for Cymbalta.

00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> When I did move out, he
called me and said that he was

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
standing in the basement
next to a noose, and I said,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and what's your safety plan?

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.838 align:middle line:90%
And he said, to call you.

00:28:46.838 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
not a safety plan.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:84%
You need to hang
up and call 911.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And I hate having
to tell him that.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It feels callous to me.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're going through
withdrawal psychiatric drugs,

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the best thing is to kind of
get back off that ledge and just

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.980 align:middle line:84%
say, Dave, just give yourself--
give yourself more time.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself more time.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Continue to fight for
it, and someday, you'll

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
regain a sense of normalcy
in your day-to-day life.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically, we find that
the withdrawal phenomenon is

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the opposite of
whatever the drug does.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If the intention of the
drug is to help somebody

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
be more relaxed or
help them fall asleep,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
then when they're
experiencing withdrawal,

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:84%
what they will experience
is anxiety and restlessness

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and insomnia.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
It may even get so bad that
they are profoundly depressed

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and consider suicide.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Withdrawal symptoms can often
be much worse than the original

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
problems the person came with.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the withdrawal is very,
very difficult, sometimes

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:84%
quite dangerous, may take
months or years to really

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:90%
be accomplished.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:84%
People are jumping out of their
skin feeling terrific anxiety,

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.230 align:middle line:84%
having all sorts of
physiological symptoms

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:90%
that are difficult to bear.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
People cannot stop this medicine
except in the slowest possible

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.699 align:middle line:84%
way with very gradual
reductions in dose.

00:30:23.699 --> 00:30:26.693 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:26.693 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is how
I cut my pills.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing here a 10% taper.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So take the pill, I weigh it.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So whole pill at 2
milligrams weighs 0.15.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, I need 10% of that.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to take off
too much because you're

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
going to waste the pills.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost there actually.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:90%
That's 10%.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The first time I tapered, I
didn't have my scale as yet,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
so I was just eyeballing because
I was determined to get off.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Your body will tell you if
you're handling the cuts based

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:90%
on symptoms.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a while
to get from 2 to 1.6.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:90%
It was 1.64.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's all I could go.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So this group has
almost 2,300 members.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:90%
People just post stuff.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.120 align:middle line:90%
How's everyone doing today?

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a strange window today.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Up dose for almost two days.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Up dose is when you're
at a certain dose

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and the symptoms get
really bad, so you go back

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to the original dose where
you weren't feeling so bad.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has unique stuff
running through you.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:90%
No two persons are alike.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I had brain zap.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:90%
I had tremors.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.667 align:middle line:90%
I had severe night sweats.

00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a symptom where it
feels like things are crawling

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:90%
inside my body, just moving.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I came across this
image, and I was like, wow,

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly how--

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly how it is.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Nobody understands this.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have support,
you will lose yourself.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I have been a part
of these groups

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:90%
since August of last year.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And since August of last year,
we lost three people to suicide

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:90%
in my support groups.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We lost a 50-something
year old woman

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
whose doctor cold turkied
her off of Klonopin,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.300 align:middle line:90%
and she suffered.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And she has two little boys.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And she walked in
front of a train

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.850 align:middle line:84%
because she couldn't
deal with it anymore.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:84%
About a month ago, we lost
a 40-something year old guy.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.130 align:middle line:90%
He shot himself in the head.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Blew his-- blew his head off.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're losing
people in this fight.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I think about it all the time.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:84%
What if my symptoms get to the
point where I can't make it?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go back to the
start of this disease model

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:90%
in the 1980s, OK?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, the first drug that
was tested in this new era

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:10%
was Xanax, alprazolam,
for panic disorder.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And here was the
study they conducted.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They compared Xanax
versus a placebo

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:84%
group and the primary
outcome measure

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:84%
was the number of panic
attacks on average per week.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And after four weeks,
Xanax was doing better.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:10%
Fewer panic attacks.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:10%
At eight weeks,
the Xanax patients

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.600 align:middle line:10%
were doing no
better than placebo.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:10%
And then, at the
end of 14 weeks,

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:10%
the Xanax patients
were doing worse

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.540 align:middle line:10%
than they were at the
beginning, and much,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:10%
much worse than the
placebo patients.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.718 align:middle line:10%
The trial told of harm done.

00:33:48.718 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It told of people who were
going to get addicted.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
When they came off,
they'd have all sorts

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of withdrawal symptoms, and
some people unable to get off.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what the study showed.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:90%
What did they report?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't report the
eight-week results.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.030 align:middle line:10%
They focused on the
four-week results

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:10%
because that was
a story that told

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.680 align:middle line:10%
of an effective new
treatment for panic disorder

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:10%
and completely hid
the 14-week results.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, Xanax became
one of the best-selling drugs

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.450 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It is still prescribed
left and right.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And what did we have
in the early '80s?

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:84%
A story of science
that told of harm done.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The longer you
take a study out,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.400 align:middle line:84%
the more likely you are to see
people not doing well on that

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
drug or developing side
effects from that drug.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So the pharmaceutical industry
doesn't favor long-term studies

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:84%
for monetary reasons
and for outcome reasons.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to show
that their drug actually

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:90%
doesn't do well.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The gorilla in the room is
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The drug companies spend
something like $80 billion

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
a year on marketing
and lobbying.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They spend much, much
less on research,

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
and most of the research they do
is really a tool of marketing.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There's as much marketing
in the tests that are devised

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to measure the outcomes, in the
investigators that are hired

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:90%
to conduct the study.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff is
marketing, but it's

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:84%
presented and manufactured
and published as science.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:10%
>> So here's how it's
done and how it was done.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:10%
The pharmaceutical companies
funneled all sorts of money

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:10%
to what are called
thought leaders,

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.170 align:middle line:10%
academic psychiatrists
at prestigious American

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:10%
universities, Harvard,
Stanford, Johns Hopkins,

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:10%
and those academic
psychiatrists began

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:10%
working for the drug
companies as consultants,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:10%
serving as their speakers,
advisors, et cetera.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.550 align:middle line:10%
You would start with a
clinical study of the drug,

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:10%
but who's designing the study?

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:10%
The pharmaceutical companies.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:10%
They know how to design it
to make their drug look good.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:10%
That's step one.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:10%
Who then analyzes the data?

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, their own people do it.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It's done by the drug
companies themselves.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Third, then, who
writes the papers?

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It's actually ghostwriters
hired by the drug companies

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:90%
to write up the study.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.110 align:middle line:84%
They now present this
study to the people

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that they want to be the
big names of the study,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and then those thought
leaders basically sign off

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:84%
on the ghostwritten papers
and they become, quote,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:84%
the "authors" of
the published paper.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The former editors of the
medical journals like "JAMA"

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.457 align:middle line:84%
and "New England Journal
of Medicine" and "BMJ",

00:36:18.457 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:84%
"British Medical
Journal", they've all

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:84%
said that basically, we became
vehicles for story laundering.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.525 align:middle line:10%
It was a corrupted creation
of an evidence base.

00:36:27.525 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm a practicing
doctor in some town.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.410 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to believe?

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to believe Mr. Doctor
bigwig at Harvard University

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:90%
that this is the best science.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So my obligation is to use the
very drug they say is so great.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:90%
So, for example, Prozac.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Prozac didn't really
work in the trials.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Prozac had all sorts
of adverse effects.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And those of us
who are old enough

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to remember when Prozac came
to market, the drug itself

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.680 align:middle line:90%
was on the cover of magazines.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Our powers are such now
that we can give you

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.130 align:middle line:90%
whatever personality you want.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:10%
That's how great our
knowledge is advancing.

It's just a lot of people can't
work up the determination.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.620 align:middle line:10%
It's not about benzos.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.980 align:middle line:10%
It's about your determination.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.420 align:middle line:10%
That's how people stop smoking.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:10%

heroin, coke, whatever.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:10%
I've seen this all the time.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Why do you think it's so
hard to get people off benzos?

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:10%

They don't want to go through

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.740 align:middle line:10%
any little pain,
discomfort, and suffering.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.380 align:middle line:10%

impression that you gave.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I was going
to have withdrawal symptoms.

If you had told me,
by the way, this drug

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:48.650 align:middle line:84%
can give you
withdrawal symptoms,

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:84%
then I would have
made my own decision.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I based my decision
on taking this drug

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because of you, because of
the trust that I had in you.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.370 align:middle line:84%
If I was given the
clear picture as to what

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:84%
the profile of this
drug was, I would

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:90%
have said no freaking way.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:90%
He's following the script.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, I went
to medical school

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a board
certified psychiatrist,

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and I follow everything that
they say to diagnose people.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.705 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he doesn't believe
that he's doing anything wrong.

So general lack of
knowledge about the dangers

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of these drugs is one
of the main reasons

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that doctors continue
to prescribe,

she went on medication,

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:90%
she was just fine.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:84%
She was a little
depressed, but she was not

having psychotic episodes.

She was not hallucinating.

Do you think that the medication
is actually the cause of this?

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:84%

The more that we were talking
about, this is who Rebecca is.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.300 align:middle line:90%
turned her into someone else.

she should be on medication,

and here's why.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And we read off the

we went down this path
of, is medication harmful,

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:84%
we got no support from the
psychiatrist that we saw.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's not medication, then
you're not doing it right.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.635 align:middle line:90%
But we stuck to our guns.

00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:84%
This sounds very dramatic,
but I feel that decision

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.320 align:middle line:90%
saved our daughter's life.

the vocabulary to say
that when I was her age.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Within a few months,
I was back to normal.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Not normal, but I was--

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:84%
my hallucinations
were completely gone,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and what was left was
the issues to begin with,

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the anxiety and the
eating disorder.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.885 align:middle line:84%
And then, we could move to
focus on those, because those

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:08.685 align:middle line:90%
were the problems.

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:11.183 align:middle line:90%


00:48:11.183 --> 00:48:12.600 align:middle line:84%

that I never

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.120 align:middle line:84%
thought that I would do during
that year, and even afterwards.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, there's no
way I can go to college.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle that.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.570 align:middle line:90%
But here I am, handling it.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's paradise
for someone who

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:90%
loves school as much as I do.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just kind of being
a normal college student

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.490 align:middle line:84%

what I can actually do now.

>> So why did you
do this for me?

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just as concerned
as you were about coming off

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:54.220 align:middle line:84%
the drugs, and I wanted to make
sure that you were in charge.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You did what you felt
was best, but you also

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.720 align:middle line:90%
had the tools laid out for you.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The best way is, essentially,
an exponential taper.

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
plotted out here.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And what that leads to is
this nice, slow decline

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:90%
over an extended period of time.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it
was of any value?

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, because
when I did it myself,

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I went down too quickly
and it felt horrible.
