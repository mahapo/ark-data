00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.350
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.851
<v ->Hi, sweets.</v>

3
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:48.070
<v ->Mom, it's 4.</v>

4
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.070
<v ->I'm thinking a little off the sides.</v>

5
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.071
<v ->You said deal.</v>

6
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.749
<v ->I know, I know.</v>

7
00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.649
If I took some off the top here, I think it would

8
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.079
really lighten it up.

9
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:00.698
<v ->Mom.</v>

10
00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.158
(clicking flat iron)

11
00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:11.136
<v ->Just a sec.</v>

12
00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:15.866
I'm sorry, I just can't leave before close tonight.

13
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.566
Joey's out sick and Bev has class.

14
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.846
<v ->But you promised.</v>

15
00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.406
<v ->I know.</v>

16
00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.226
My schedule got slammed.

17
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.626
I just don't have enough time, May.

18
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.386
<v ->You never have enough time.</v>

19
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.146
<v ->7:30. I swear.</v>

20
00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.576
Love you.

21
00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:45.166
<v ->Hey!</v>

22
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.896
(boys laugh)

23
00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.156
<v ->Watch it, kid!</v>

24
00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:28.634
(door creeks)

25
00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:35.052
(eerie music)

26
00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:00.548
(crash)

27
00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:04.078
(dramatic music)

28
00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:17.208
<v ->75 dollars.</v>

29
00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:18.916
<v ->75 dollars!</v>

30
00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.976
That's two days, man.

31
00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.616
<v ->It's your time.</v>

32
00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:25.316
You think it's so valuable, you keep it.

33
00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:26.836
<v ->This is perfectly good time here.</v>

34
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:30.006
<v ->This is good time.</v>

35
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.472
That is decent time.

36
00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:35.352
Nobody buys decent.

37
00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:40.352
They want amazing, alone, fantastic time.

38
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.820
<v ->Excuse me.</v>

39
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.550
Excuse me.

40
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.528
<v ->What?</v>

41
00:04:04.528 --> 00:04:06.702
<v ->What's in all those jars?</v>

42
00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:09.122
<v ->Time.</v>

43
00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.422
<v ->Time? That's impossible.</v>

44
00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:15.122
<v ->Are you calling me a liar?</v>

45
00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:19.062
<v ->Well, if it is time, what does it do?</v>

46
00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:20.502
<v ->Buy a good time, you get a good time.</v>

47
00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:23.772
Buy some alone time, you get some alone time.

48
00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:26.582
<v ->Enough time?</v>

49
00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:28.182
Does that give you more time?

50
00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.534
<v ->It gives you enough time to do what you want to do.</v>

51
00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:31.454
Look, do you want to buy something or what?

52
00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.934
<v ->That. Enough time.</v>

53
00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.663
I'll buy that one.

54
00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.203
<v ->100 dollars.</v>

55
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:44.253
<v ->Oh.</v>

56
00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:45.595
<v ->Right.</v>

57
00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:46.834
May I help you?

58
00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:48.734
<v Man>Two nice times please.</v>

59
00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:51.334
<v Woman>Nice? Typical.</v>

60
00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:54.894
<v ->Fine, great. Happy?</v>

61
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.114
Two great times.

62
00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:03.485
(woman laughs)

63
00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:13.534
<v ->Hello?</v>

64
00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:16.404
Hello?

65
00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:18.695
Hey, guy.

66
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.144
<v ->Not so fast, kid.</v>

67
00:05:33.144 --> 00:05:34.704
What do you have in your hand?

68
00:05:34.704 --> 00:05:36.044
<v ->The door handle.</v>

69
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.304
<v ->The other hand.</v>

70
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.290
(ominous sound)

71
00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:49.549
A few hours hard labor.

72
00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.708
That should teach you something about the value of time.

73
00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:52.888
Now, let's see.

74
00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:54.788
The aisles need a good sweeping, the clocks are off,

75
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:57.748
the hour glasses all need resetting and, of course,

76
00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:00.718
there's bathroom.

77
00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:07.628
<v ->What was that?</v>

78
00:06:07.628 --> 00:06:09.448
<v ->Slow time.</v>

79
00:06:09.448 --> 00:06:10.808
<v ->You could have killed me.</v>

80
00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:12.908
My heart almost stopped beating in my chest.

81
00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.248
<v ->You're fine.</v>

82
00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.908
<v ->Well, if I'm going to do all this work,</v>

83
00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:19.508
then what do I get?

84
00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:21.208
<v ->A clean conscious.</v>

85
00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:22.628
<v ->What about my time?</v>

86
00:06:22.628 --> 00:06:24.918
<v ->We'll see.</v>

87
00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:31.626
(music)

88
00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:46.094
<v Woman>Oh, please, Willa.</v>

89
00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:48.595
Don't be docious, it's their 60th anniversary.

90
00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:50.335
I hope you have a nice time?

91
00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:52.076
<v ->You always do this.</v>

92
00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:54.286
<v Woman>What? What do I do?</v>

93
00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:55.711
<v ->First it's, "Let's buy something simple."</v>

94
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.211
And before you know it, I'm going into debt

95
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:58.867
(muffled) for a birthday present.

96
00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:01.798
<v Woman>(muffled) But it's their 60th anniversary.</v>

97
00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.517
(Door slams)

98
00:07:13.977 --> 00:07:15.668
<v Girl>You know, there's really no point in all this.</v>

99
00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.547
As soon as a person buys a clock, they're just

100
00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:18.957
they're just going to throw it in their car

101
00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:20.428
and the hands are going to go all over.

102
00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:22.307
Besides, how do you know that they're not sending it

103
00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:24.587
to a cousin in Russia or Kansas.

104
00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:27.327
Then, they'll just have to reset it anyway.

105
00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:29.108
<v ->I'm not going to say this twice.</v>

106
00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:32.027
Check the atomic clock, then adjust the second hand

107
00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:34.868
on each clock to the exact time.

108
00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:36.348
Got it?

109
00:07:36.348 --> 00:07:37.767
<v ->Yeah, duh.</v>

110
00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:39.328
I set the clocks.

111
00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:41.667
It's not rocket science.

112
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.738
<v ->Good.</v>

113
00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:52.318
(Clock chimes)

114
00:07:56.327 --> 00:08:00.627
<v ->So, you work here all by yourself?</v>

115
00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:02.087
I help my mom at work.

116
00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:06.396
I mean, it's just a salon, but it's pretty cool.

117
00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:10.147
Where's your family?

118
00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:11.386
<v ->I don't have a family.</v>

119
00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:14.324
<v ->Everyone has a family.</v>

120
00:08:14.324 --> 00:08:16.224
<v ->Not everyone.</v>

121
00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:19.605
Now, get to work.

122
00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:21.873
I'll be watching.

123
00:08:46.823 --> 00:08:48.513
<v ->Join the union?</v>

124
00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:49.884
<v ->What?</v>

125
00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:52.152
<v ->Get back to work.</v>

126
00:08:53.262 --> 00:08:56.161
<v ->What is that thing?</v>

127
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.701
<v ->That thing is a time extractor.</v>

128
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.861
The only one in the world.

129
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:06.541
People want to sell their time, I make it possible.

130
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.622
I built it myself.

131
00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:10.441
<v ->Don't people need their time?</v>

132
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.021
<v ->They don't know what to do with it anyway,</v>

133
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:15.241
so they just waste it all on office parties and

134
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.081
pointless family obligations.

135
00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:21.600
<v ->Well, can you get your time back?</v>

136
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.078
<v ->You can't add hours back on, but you can</v>

137
00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:28.728
change the quality of time you have.

138
00:09:29.098 --> 00:09:32.158
<v ->So, you lose it forever?</v>

139
00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:34.398
<v ->Most people don't even notice.</v>

140
00:09:34.398 --> 00:09:36.658
Now, go down to storage and bring back

141
00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:38.538
whatever quality time we have left.

142
00:09:38.538 --> 00:09:39.878
Be careful!

143
00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:41.758
Family time and quality time look similar,

144
00:09:41.758 --> 00:09:43.518
but they're not.

145
00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:46.168
Peach and tangerine.

146
00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:10.947
(gentle music)

147
00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:47.777
<v ->What the hell do you think you're doing?</v>

148
00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:50.467
<v ->I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.</v>

149
00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:05.636
<v ->What?</v>

150
00:11:05.636 --> 00:11:08.576
<v ->You said I could get my time.</v>

151
00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:11.536
<v ->No. I said we'll see.</v>

152
00:11:11.536 --> 00:11:13.376
<v ->That's not fair.</v>

153
00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:16.346
<v ->Fair is not being a thief.</v>

154
00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:17.492
<v ->I worked.</v>

155
00:11:17.492 --> 00:11:19.712
I did everything you asked.

156
00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.472
<v ->Leave me alone, kid.</v>

157
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.962
<v ->Wait, I'll trade.</v>

158
00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:27.350
My time for the enough time.

159
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.730
<v ->It'll cost.</v>

160
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.020
<v ->Fine.</v>

161
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.520
(machine starts)

162
00:11:52.288 --> 00:11:55.468
<v ->What's a kid want with enough time anyway?</v>

163
00:11:55.468 --> 00:11:58.408
<v ->My mom said that if she had enough time that</v>

164
00:11:58.408 --> 00:12:02.098
she'd make pancakes tonight for my birthday.

165
00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:10.728
<v ->All right.</v>

166
00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:13.417
(machine stops)

167
00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:17.707
<v ->That's it?</v>

168
00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.937
<v ->That's it.</v>

169
00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:34.786
<v ->Mom!</v>

170
00:12:34.786 --> 00:12:38.025
<v ->Hey, babe. I was getting worried.</v>

171
00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.303
Almost done. I swear.

172
00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:42.833
Oh, hey. Grab me my pop.

173
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.821
<v Woman>Look, they're growing into my hairline.</v>

174
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:18.176
Please tell me you can do this.

175
00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:21.516
<v ->I would if I could, but I was supposed to leave at 4.</v>

176
00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.986
Thanks, baby.

177
00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:32.956
You know?

178
00:13:32.956 --> 00:13:33.876
What the F.

00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.875
Let's do those brows. I got time.

180
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:36.995
<v ->Thank you.</v>

181
00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:38.055
<v ->But mom?</v>

182
00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:39.334
<v ->Just make sure you get here and then</v>

183
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:41.074
definitely get this spot.

184
00:13:41.074 --> 00:13:42.694
<v ->Mom. You said if you had enough time</v>

185
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:44.394
<v ->It'll only be another few minutes.</v>

186
00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:46.114
Oh my God. Idea!

187
00:13:46.114 --> 00:13:47.694
I just got this new threading kit.

188
00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:48.874
<v ->Wait! Mom.</v>

189
00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:49.734
<v ->Doesn't that kill?</v>

190
00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:52.584
<v ->No. They did mine at the expo.</v>

191
00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:03.539
(doors banging)

192
00:14:29.428 --> 00:14:32.267
<v ->You lied.</v>

193
00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.347
<v ->To who?</v>

194
00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:36.048
<v ->It didn't work.</v>

195
00:14:36.048 --> 00:14:39.148
My mom took it and it didn't work.

196
00:14:39.148 --> 00:14:41.148
<v ->Yeah, well.</v>

197
00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:45.067
Like I said, people just waste their time.

198
00:14:45.067 --> 00:14:47.527
<v ->Why?</v>

199
00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:49.326
<v ->I don't know.</v>

200
00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:52.436
<v ->It's stupid.</v>

201
00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:10.387
You know, this place is a dump.

202
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:14.147
You're probably in federal violation.

203
00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:17.434
You should get someone to clean it.

204
00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:20.325
<v ->Know anyone?</v>

205
00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:22.353
<v ->Maybe.</v>

206
00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:26.363
<v ->The shop opens at 8:30.</v>

207
00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:29.103
<v ->8:30? It's the summer.</v>

208
00:15:29.103 --> 00:15:31.483
<v ->8:30.</v>

209
00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:34.073
<v ->Fine, 8:30.</v>

210
00:15:36.643 --> 00:15:38.658
<v ->Deal?</v>

211
00:15:38.658 --> 00:15:41.204
<v ->Deal.</v>

212
00:15:46.894 --> 00:15:50.904
(happy music)
