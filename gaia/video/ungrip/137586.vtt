If you are asked to
ponder the one thing that

things, our first instinct

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:90%
is to protect them from others.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%

However, love is
distinct from these.

our first instinct

what is freedom?

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look
at the Oxford definition--

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
"the power or right to act,
speak, or think freely,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the state of being free."

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
But that's kind of mechanical.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I really don't like
that definition.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I
said, OK, well what's

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.063 align:middle line:90%
the definition of a slave?

00:04:59.063 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:90%

property of another and is

forced to obey them.

by something."

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you're dependent on
something, are you free?

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.045 align:middle line:84%

something, are you free?

more than physical barriers

the heart and mind

of an authentic

Pay attention, not
to the physical steps

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
For it is a personal
path within all of us.

If we mimic the path of another,
it is not a true path for us,

that I say and do.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what kind of led
to us building the Earthship

and to building a power
system and living off grid.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about off grid,
it's not just the power grid

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:10%
There's also the corporate grid.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And so, myself
personally, I have

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:10%
gotten rid of the mortgage,
credit cards, loans,

bank accounts.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any of those
kind of things anymore.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm off of the
financial grid and I'm

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
off the corporate grid as
much as possible as well.

If I started growing our own
food, generating our own power,

then we're not
susceptible to disruptions

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in the grid should
there be a failure.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And because of its
complexity, the probability

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
of that happening is
increasing over time.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:90%
the system.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Every government would
have to grow if you keep

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:90%
placing more burden upon it.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:84%
All of that burden is
actually the responsibility

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that we no longer,
as the citizens,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
will want to take care
of on our own anymore.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We want our government to
take care of it for us.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So all of that burden
feeds the system and that's

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
how the system grows.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:10%
If a system is becoming
faulty, if a system

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:10%
is becoming corrupt, that's
because the foundation

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:10%
or the soil that that system has
grown out of has become faulty

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.936 align:middle line:10%
and has become corrupt.

00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
first place that we

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
need to start looking
is the foundation,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.315 align:middle line:84%
or the soil that this
system grew out of.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
looking at the people.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a fellow down in
the US, Taos, New Mexico.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:90%
He's an architect.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing is he's
building earth round

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
houses which are passively solar
heated out of automobile tires.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And you stack the tires like
bricks, pack them full of dirt,

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and they're backfilled.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:90%
And they're completely off grid.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The sun heats the
dirt and the mass,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and that heat then radiates
back into the house.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And then in the wintertime,
because the sun is so low,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
it penetrates deep
into the building

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:90%
to warm up the building.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.409 align:middle line:84%
And in summer time,
it's really high,

00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't penetrate
the building at all

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:90%
and keeps the building cool.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, collect water
off the roof into cisterns,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and we recycle
water in the house,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and you know solar panels
for power generation.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So the house essentially is
like a self-contained ecosystem

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because it collects its own
water, treats its own waste,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
generates its own power,
generates its own heat,

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's all built out of
recycled materials that are

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:90%
abundant out in our ecology.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
There is automobile tires
all over the place, right?

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So, we're trying to build
houses out of materials that you

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
can find readily laying around.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
My wife is studying to be
a homeopath at the time.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And she started recognizing
that there are a few things that

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
are going on in the
medical industry that

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
isn't necessarily good for us.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And through the process
of learning about some

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of the medical issues that we
were learning through Kari's

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
education, it
started to wake us up

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to some of the other things
going on in our economy

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and in our political system,
and that kind of stuff.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not a health care system,
but a keep you sick system

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
so that they can make lots of
money through pharmaceuticals.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.205 align:middle line:84%
I held onto crap in
my life, whether it

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:90%
was emotional or mental.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.597 align:middle line:84%
And my body had a real
hard time dealing with it.

00:11:40.597 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've since
learned that it's

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
holding onto that stuff
is what causes cancer

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of illnesses and
distress on the physical body.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to take
matters into our own hands

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and be responsible.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Rather than react to
what was going on,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:90%
we decided to be proactive.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we came out while the
economy was at its hottest.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we sold everything,
came out here.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:84%
That all stemmed,
really, from some

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
Kari was bringing back

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.310 align:middle line:90%
from her studying.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And she brought this term
natural person back from school

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and said, hey, Rob,
have you heard of this?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
into it and realizing

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
huge deception going on

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
in the political arena,
well, and the medical arena,

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and the economy, and all
that kind of stuff too.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But my initial reaction was I
was extremely angry and upset.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:90%
How dare they do this?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to be there
to protect us and guide us

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and help us, not manipulate us.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of started
my road towards trying

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to understand their
system and learn

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.445 align:middle line:84%
what human rights is all about
and what freedom is all about.

00:13:07.445 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:90%
What is the law?

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
What laws apply to every
single man on this earth?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Because they often say
no man is above the law.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.506 align:middle line:84%
So which law are they
talking about then?

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Well there's common law
and there' civil law.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
There's contract law.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:90%
There's Sharia law.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:90%
There's Christian law.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Like there's all kinds of laws.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Admiralty is just one of them.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes down
to it, a lot of those

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
are only associated
to activities

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we're
doing and what we consent to.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So corporations,
for example, are all

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:06.389 align:middle line:84%
subject to a number of
laws, because they are

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:90%
the creation of the government.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So the master gives the rules
for the servant to follow.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:90%
So does that apply to you?

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, unless you're
a corporation

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
or you are behaving as a
corporation, the answer is no.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:10%
So I asked the question,
what is the law?

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:10%


00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The history of law gives us
an understanding of evolution

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:10%
which is intimately linked to
the evolution of our species.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:10%
The function of
law does not simply

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:10%
govern our physical actions.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:10%
We have many layers
of existence,

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:10%
including physical, mental,
emotional, conscious,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Because we cannot
escape any of these,

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:10%
an affliction to one of them
reverberates in consequence

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:10%
between all of them.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:10%
It is irresponsible to
assume that law pertains only

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:10%
to portions of our lives.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Law is the very
foundation of life itself.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
All law forms today are
based upon our consent.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Should the people of today
discover the important truth

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:10%
that we can say
no at any time, we

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:10%
may find a revolution
within the current system

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.128 align:middle line:10%
to be inevitable.

00:15:16.128 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything we are
experiencing is the evolution

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:90%
of experience itself.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.620 align:middle line:84%
This is why I can't say what
the future should look like.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The second I give a
model for the future,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
there will instantly appear a
rebellion against that model.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And that rebellion
is very important

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
because the future is
not about ending up

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
with a beautiful result, it's
about learning from the process

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.833 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that process
to always welcome change.

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There are three fundamental
stages to our evolution--

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
childhood, adulthood, and
parenthood or leadership.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:10%
A child is typified by being
dependent upon external support

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:10%
for food, protection,
and health.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
In the animal kingdom,
the transition

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
from childhood to
adulthood is complete

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
when the child is no longer
dependent upon others

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
to be fed, protected,
and kept in good health.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We are a species of perpetual
children today in our society.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And as easy as it
would be to blame

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
the political, economic,
and societal system that

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:84%
breeds dependent people,
it is an inescapable truth

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that the entire
system is a reflection

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
of the condition of its people.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Seldom do we see adults
today, in the sense that they

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:10%
can govern themselves.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:10%
Which means it is
even less frequent

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:10%
that we see individuals fit
for parenthood or leadership.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:10%
The stage of parenthood
and leadership

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:10%
comes when, not only
can we govern ourselves,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:10%
but when we are ready and
willing to help others

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:10%
become self-governing.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The leaders of today
are, unfortunately,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
nothing more than
children with adult bodies

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:90%
wearing leadership clothes.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Our entire species is
being faced with a choice--

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.622 align:middle line:84%
govern the self or be
governed by others.

00:17:08.622 --> 00:17:11.580 align:middle line:10%
>> 1, 2, 3, 4--

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:22.159 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Problem with courts
these days, that I see,

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.216 align:middle line:84%
is that people don't see them
for what they really are.

00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I was raised to respect
authority, follow

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the authority, and
do as they say.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
are brought up that way.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned though
is that that authority

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
is based 100% on our
consent to being governed.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I found a
Supreme Court ruling

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that says that the
consent of the governed

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is a foundational
principle of democracy.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's consent?

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Does that imply that you
have a choice whether you're

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%
going to agree to that or not?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
that the answer is yes.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So we all have free will choice
to consent to being governed.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, then
we've given them permission

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.595 align:middle line:90%
to use their authority over us.

00:18:24.595 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we used our free will
to apply for, or register,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
for something, we
gave them permission

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to create a
corporation to interact

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:90%
between the man and the system.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's that corporation
that the system acts upon.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But because we don't know who
we are, we assume or we think,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.779 align:middle line:90%
that that is us.

00:19:00.779 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you take a look
at your credit card

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.778 align:middle line:84%
or take a look at your
driver's license or your birth

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
certificate or any of
that kind of stuff,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people,
including myself,

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
thought that that
was actually me.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So when the courts
are acting upon it,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
all they can really act
upon is the corporation.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason they
can act upon the man

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is because we agree to
be the representative

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of that corporation
and bind ourself

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to the terms and conditions
of that agreement.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
But we can say no at any time.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Give the public the facts.

00:19:41.845 --> 00:19:43.802 align:middle line:90%
They have a right to know.

00:19:43.802 --> 00:19:44.602 align:middle line:90%
Got it?

00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%

documents, such as licenses,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:84%
registrations,
permits, applications,

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that is your consent to being
governed by certain guidelines,

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
regulations, acts, stipulations,
laws, within that corporation.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you are asking for a
service and they're saying OK,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.416 align:middle line:84%
as long as you
follow these rules.

00:20:06.416 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
If you signed any of those
contracts which are represented

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
by a legal fiction
set up in your name,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
then you, yourself, are
bound by those rules,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
bound by the regulations
because you did that.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:84%
You consented to being
governed by that.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to remove
yourself from that,

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to dissolve
those contracts.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they make
it seem mandatory,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:90%
that you must comply.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the language
that's being used.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing you want
to become very wary of is

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.045 align:middle line:90%
the language that they use.

what would the normal definition

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:10%
word?

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Human being.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Human being.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we take a look
at the dictionary,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
it says "a human being
regarded as an individual."

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what we would normally
view the word person to be.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
In law, now we're
using their words.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're dealing
with corporations

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and the government, and
all that kind of stuff,

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
person means "an individual
or incorporated group

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
having certain legal rights
and responsibilities."

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Not a human being regarded
as an individual, but as

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:90%
an individual or a corporation.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So they actually said
compare artificial person

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and natural person.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So I looked it up
and I compared them.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Artificial person "a legal
entity, not a human being."

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Natural person.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
A natural person
is "a human being

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that has the capacity
for rights and duties."

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
have the capacity

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that you're
going to use your free will

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:90%
to exercise them.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You have the capacity for rights
and duties, but it's up to you

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to exercise them.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I actually found
the legal dictionary

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that they use in the
US, so every time they

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.588 align:middle line:84%
argue about the
definition of a word--

00:22:21.588 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:90%
--yeah.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a volume that's as
long my arms of books.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.144 align:middle line:84%
So by curiosity, I looked
up the word person.

00:22:31.144 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And on each page,
there was probably,

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I would estimate, about
15 different definitions

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
with each court case.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And the word person ran
for around 200, 250 pages.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So there is literally thousands
of different definitions

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:90%
for the word person.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
How can anybody
possibly learn all that

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:90%
in order to protect yourself?

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Well part of the Magna Carta
states that "to none will

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.882 align:middle line:84%
we sell, or deny, a
right or a justice."

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Well that means is that if you
want to exercise your rights

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and you want to have justice,
they can't sell it to you.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
They sure do now, it costs you
hundreds of dollars an hour

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.842 align:middle line:84%
to hire a lawyer just
so you can get justice.

00:23:18.842 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%

force other people

to do their bidding.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And as our country
grows, more and more,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.758 align:middle line:84%
you will find men and
women marching and fighting

00:23:48.758 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:90%

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
This was a US case in--

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
what's the 1793.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%

got hooked into the corporate
game that's being played out.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So a sovereign, a
person, body, or state

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
vested with independent
and supreme authority.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
sovereign, does that

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.076 align:middle line:84%
mean that somebody else

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:42.844 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:42.844 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:10%

OK?

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.075 align:middle line:10%
But what they do is they try
to get you into a contract

00:24:55.075 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:10%
so that you contract
away your rights,

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:10%
so that they then have
authority over you.

If you give it to them,
that's a contract.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.556 align:middle line:90%
You then gave them authority.

00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%

And we're building it.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:10%
So we, essentially,
went ahead with it

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:10%
and waited for the
county to say something.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
About three or four
months into the project,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:90%
we received a letter.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
That letter,
essentially, indicated

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that we notice that there
is some development.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Please stop the
development till you

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:90%
fill in a development permit.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, I had been
studying my human rights

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:10%
for a couple of
years at that point.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:10%
So I sent them a
letter, essentially,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:10%
outlining that I am a individual
not a person or a corporation,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:10%
and you don't have jurisdiction
over anything that I do.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:10%
And that your letter also
indicated that if I sign this,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:10%
you have permission to
come on our property.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that you
currently don't have permission

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to come on our property.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.206 align:middle line:10%
So I, essentially,
told them you're

00:26:32.206 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:10%
going to have to provide me
with a proof of your claim

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:10%
that I have to follow the
guidelines of the Municipality

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:10%
Act.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.753 align:middle line:84%
And they do not have permission
to come onto our property.

00:26:45.753 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
About a week later, the
tax assessor showed up.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him are you here
as an agent of the county?

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, can you
tell me which parts of the Act

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:10%
that your authority comes from.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:10%
And so he told me.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And I said, tell you
what, let me look those up

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:10%
and I'll get back to you.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:10%
And he was quite reasonable.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:10%
He agreed with that and he
left without any incident.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So I looked up the
Act and found out

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that he had to give me
a reasonable notice.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:10%
And because he was an agent,
I had already told the county

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:10%
that they didn't have permission
to come on the property

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:10%
so I had grounds
for several charges

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:10%
if I wanted to of trespassing
and breach of the Municipality

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:10%
Act against this guy.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
So I confronted him on it.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The final result was I got
a letter from the Minister

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:84%
indicating that I had several
good points in my letter

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and that he encouraged
me to settle

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:90%
my dispute with the county.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And he essentially washed
his hands of the whole thing.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't heard
from the county since.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.898 align:middle line:84%
They've left knee alone
now for two years.

00:27:56.898 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I can't have freedom
unless I also

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:90%
recognize that I have a duty.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:10%
And I have a duty
to share with people

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:10%
what I've learned from
not only the legal aspect,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:10%
but also the spiritual,
emotional, mental,

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:10%
and physical freedoms
that I've been working on.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:10%
I felt that part of my duty
was to start getting out there

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:10%
and start teaching this.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Tetro.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:28:41.905 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Stand by for operation
of the time machine.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, sir.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:10%
Where to this time, Captain?

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Back to the year 1215
and King John of England.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:28:49.815 --> 00:28:50.615 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.615 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Every body is
familiar with Robin Hood.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:84%
King John, you know the
tyrant, was actually real.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem with King
John is that he did not

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:84%
know how to fight a war and
he had no land to his name.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:10%
So he ran to the Pope in 1213
and asked Pope Innocent III

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:10%
for some help.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he
actually turned over

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:84%
the whole kingdom of England to
the Pope in return for support

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
from the Pope so that
he could fight his wars.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So that little document,
essentially, turned King John

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:84%
into the Pope's vassal,
which means that he promised

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:90%
to be loyal to the Pope.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Pope, then owned
everything in England.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
A couple years later, his barons
cornered him and stuck a knife

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.387 align:middle line:84%
to him, and said, you
know what, we're not

00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
happy with the way
you're treating us.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.511 align:middle line:84%
We want you to sign
this Magna Carta.

00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I sign this,
I shall be no king.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You have given me four
and twenty overlords.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> These 24 will see that
you carry out the terms

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Magna Carta.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:84%
You have no choice,
King John, but to sign.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Magna Carta was
the basis of English law.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, Jet, and the
basis of American law as well.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The English Magna
Carta became the model

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:90%
for the American Bill of Rights.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the founding document
for our human rights within

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:84%
our country, within
Great Britain,

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
within the United States,
Australia, New Zealand,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
South Africa, any crown colony,
their legal systems are based

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:90%
on this document.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
But he was doing
it at knife point.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:90%
He's under duress.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.084 align:middle line:90%
Is that a legal contract?

00:30:43.084 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:90%
So I have a question.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:84%
If it was under duress, and
this is not a legal contract,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:84%
then how can they
possibly continue

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:84%
using this document as the
basis for our legal system?

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I would suspect that most
people would recognize

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that a valid contract
would require

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that the individual sign
on his own free will.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the case.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Pope at the
time, Pope Innocent III,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:84%
recognized that as
such because he also

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.845 align:middle line:90%
said that it was invalid.

00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The kings of Europe
decided you know what?

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:84%
There's this huge piece of land
just across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get it.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so how they did it though
is they chartered corporations,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
the king set up a corporation.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.332 align:middle line:84%
And it was funded by
the king and bankers

00:32:01.332 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of stuff.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And they came over.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.429 align:middle line:84%
And they stuck the flag
into the ground and say,

00:32:05.429 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
we claim this for
the King of England

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and set up shop, and started
dealing with the First Nations

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:90%
people that are here.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to go into all
the atrocities that happened.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Literally millions of
First Nations people

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:31.780 align:middle line:84%
died either as a result of
disease, wars, starvation.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that genocide
took place just so

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.335 align:middle line:84%
that they can
colonize this land.

00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a sad chapter
in our history.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to recognize
that that's the past.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And so let's move on.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to live in
harmony with one another

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
now without pushing our
will against another,

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and try to come to terms
with the things that

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.310 align:middle line:90%
were done in the past.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
It was essentially
the corporation

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that came and conquered
this country-- or this land,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I should say, not the country.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.875 align:middle line:84%
They came and
conquered this land.

00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It was all
corporations that came.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now that those
corporations are here,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
people started coming
over and started

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:84%
immigrating to what they
thought was Canada or the United

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.250 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1867, they passed
this thing called the British

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.710 align:middle line:90%
North America Act.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Now did the people
here vote on this?

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a piece of legislation
from Great Britain.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:90%
That's all this is.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The BNA Act is just
legislation from the Parliament

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
in Great Britain.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But it was passed off on us
as a constitutional document.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to
have a constitution,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
the people have to
vote on the document

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
not the representatives
in the legislature.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:84%
This document merged
all the colonies

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:90%
into one colony called Canada.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:90%
That's all this document did.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was passed off
as forming a country.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
The people of Great
Britain went and started

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:84%
traveling around the world and
bringing their legal system

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And even though the US declared
their independence in 1776,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.580 align:middle line:84%
they still based their legal
system on British system.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
They're all based on
that common law system.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the Admiralty
system that came with it.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Representatives from Canada,
Australia, South Africa, New

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Zealand, you know, all those
got together with Great Britain

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and start talking about,
OK, how can we really

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
set things up so that we can be
autonomous from Great Britain?

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually meant for
a couple of years 1926, 1930

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to formulate how this
was going to work.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the king then passed
the Statute of Westminster.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And that essentially broke
the tie between Great Britain

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and Canada.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The King is no longer
a part of Canada.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Canada is no longer affected
by any statutes or regulations

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:90%
from Great Britain.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the link to
the Crown was broken,

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.595 align:middle line:90%
technically we're in anarchy.

00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:45.931 align:middle line:84%
We have no document
to actually set up

00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the framework for how our
government is supposed

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.410 align:middle line:90%
to operate in this land.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.009 align:middle line:84%
In '47, they wrote a
Letters Patent creating

00:35:55.009 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:90%
the Office of Governor General.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The Governor General is
the head of this country.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been compelled to
create a permanent armaments

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.360 align:middle line:90%
industry of vast proportions.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
3 and 1/2 million men
and women are directly

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
engaged in the
defense establishment.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Now this conjunction of an
immense military establishment

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and a large arms industry is
new in the American experience.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We recognize the imperative
need for this development.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we must not
fail to comprehend

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.562 align:middle line:90%
it's grave implications.

00:36:35.562 --> 00:36:40.145 align:middle line:84%
>> There's not one piece
of territory or one thing

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of a military nature that
we want out of this war.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.840 align:middle line:84%
We want peace and prosperity
for the world as a whole.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go through these words
and let's see if you understand

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:90%
them now.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.265 align:middle line:90%
Governor General.

00:36:56.265 --> 00:36:57.750 align:middle line:90%
What's a general?

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Military.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Military.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Lieutenant, more generals.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:90%
What's a company?

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like four brigades of
man and heavy equipment.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:90%
An officer?

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The tax payer is actually an
officer who holds an office.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Commission?

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:84%
How many here work
for commission

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:90%
under a social insurance number?

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually a
commissioned officer.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So even financial terms
have military connotations.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's all done under
Admiralty, which is military.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:84%
When you turn 18 and
you start working

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:84%
under a social insurance number
or accept a birth certificate,

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
you're actually being
posted on a military post,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:84%
evidenced by a name, address,
and the date of birth,

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:90%
because what was birth?

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:90%
A vessel, right?

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a military vessel.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you agreed to be
a legal representative

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of that military
vessel, you agreed

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to be manning that
military post.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:24.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why they need
a name and birth

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
date so that they
can prove that you

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.130 align:middle line:90%
are private in their military.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:84%
All of these documents, whether
you're registering property,

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:84%
or applying for a driver's
license, or birth certificate,

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:84%
all that kind of stuff, it's
all in the public, which means

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:90%
it's all in the military side.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're holding
military offices

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:84%
when you have these
documents on your possession.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So as long as your manning
a military post, technically

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:90%
you're at war.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So Clause 1 says "We
do hereby constitute."

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Who's we?

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember seeing
any documentation that

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.260 align:middle line:84%
said the people of this
land gave them permission

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:90%
to constitute that office.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And the king doesn't
have any authority here,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
because the Statute
of Westminster 1931

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.760 align:middle line:90%
cut off all of that.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.260 align:middle line:90%
So I have a question.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Who's we?

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that it was
Prime Minister MacKenzie

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.440 align:middle line:90%
King and all of his cronies.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:90%
So how did all this happen?

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:10%
This guy here, our Prime
Minister MacKenzie King,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.980 align:middle line:10%
I did some reading on him.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And I found out he's actually
really good friends with John

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.150 align:middle line:10%
D. Rockefeller, Jr. And he
actually spent a lot of time

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:10%
in New York.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.350 align:middle line:90%
He actually consulted with him.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:90%
MacKenzie King's a lawyer.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually
Rockefeller's lawyer

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and actually help him out
with a lot of labor disputes

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that were happening
in the States.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:90%
So who signed it?

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:90%
The Prime Minister of Canada.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So our Prime Minister
signed letters patent

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to create the Office
of Governor General.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.820 align:middle line:84%
They needed to set
up another office.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:90%
So the Prime Minister did it.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
curious to find out

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
who was supporting
him to do that,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't the people
and it wasn't the king.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though he said by
His Majesty's command.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I question that, too.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Governor General's Act, you go
to Canadian government website

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.780 align:middle line:10%
and you can actually
look up the Acts,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:10%
you look up the
Governor General's Act.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And in there, Clause 1--

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
or Clause 2, says
"The Governor General

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.680 align:middle line:84%
of Canada or other chief
executive officer--" CEO?

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.830 align:middle line:90%
CEOs are for companies--

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
"or administrator carrying
on the government of Canada

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.850 align:middle line:84%
on behalf and in the name of
the sovereign by whatever title

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.070 align:middle line:84%
designated is a
corporation sole."

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:01.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.990 align:middle line:84%
A corporation sole
is a corporation

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:84%
except for there's only
one individual that

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
holds that title or
owns that corporation.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Corporation soles actually
are used all over a place.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The Pope, the office of a
Pope is a corporation sole.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The office of the King
is a corporation sole.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.300 align:middle line:84%
The Governor General, Lieutenant
Governors, the Catholic church,

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
all of their bishops
and archbishops

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and cardinals, they all
hold corporations soles.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This was on the Governor
General's website

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.550 align:middle line:90%
about 10 months ago.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:84%
You won't find it now
because they changed it.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really glad I've
got a screenshot of it.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But it says here, "Canada
is a parliamentary democracy

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and a constitutional monarchy."

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
"This means Canadians recognize
the Queen as our head of state.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Canada's Governor
General carries out

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Her Majesty's duties in
Canada on a daily basis

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.298 align:middle line:84%
and is Canada's de
facto Head of State."

00:42:17.298 --> 00:42:20.296 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.296 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody know
what de facto means?

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Illegitimate, but in effect.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:90%
So it has no legitimacy.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But because we've
all accepted it,

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.290 align:middle line:90%
that gives it force and effect.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Now as soon as you get
away from all the people

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and you remove yourself
or segregate yourself

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:84%
through a private
agreement or what have you,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:90%
that becomes private.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Governor General,
the Queen, by definition

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are only responsible
for the public.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The government is there to
deal with the public for us,

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:90%
but they turn everything public.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you register
property like land or vehicles

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
or any of that
kind of stuff, you

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:84%
turn that into a registered
item, which is in the public.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:27.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the public, they
assume that you're vulnerable

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and that you need protecting
from others and from yourself.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you're using
all of your corporations,

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that's on the public
side and that's

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:84%
all governed by the public,
which is the government.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So part of the process
that I went through

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was to actually explicitly say
I do not want to be governed.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the fundamental
rule of all forms of law.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Without your consent,
you cannot be governed.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There is not a single
law in existence created

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:90%
by man that is mandatory.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There are many that give the
illusion of being mandatory,

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:84%
but therein lies the
most important aspect

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to all of this.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It is your responsibility to
investigate and understand

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.590 align:middle line:90%
what governs you--

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.830 align:middle line:84%
not just physically, but
mentally, emotionally,

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:90%
consciously, and spiritually.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.500 align:middle line:84%
There are tyrannical
governments that force their law

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.720 align:middle line:90%
upon the people unjustly.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Some do not have
much of a choice

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to move away from these areas.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.250 align:middle line:84%
However, most do have a choice,
yet allow justifications

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.010 align:middle line:84%
to keep them exactly
where they are.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.400 align:middle line:84%
If we were on a train track just
minutes away from being hit,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
most of us would move.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Yet some have the tendency to
complain about how inconvenient

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:90%
it is to move.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:90%
There is still a choice.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Human ingenuity can
surmount any obstacle.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The only requirement is
the desire to surmount.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.370 align:middle line:84%
If we are willing to complain
or rebel against a system that

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
governs our actions, we should
know how and why it does so.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:84%
In doing this, it is important
to understand who we are,

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.240 align:middle line:84%
where we are, and
what options we have.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What was Canada defined as?

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:84%
In the Interpretation Act,
"Canada, for greater certainty,

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.460 align:middle line:84%
includes the internal
waters of Canada

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and territorial Sea of Canada."

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Now that word includes
is a tricky word.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a legal maxim that
says "the inclusion of one

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.600 align:middle line:90%
is the exclusion of all others."

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you see
the word includes,

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
means it's this
and nothing else.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Hold on here.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.920 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to tell me
that Canada is just water?

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:90%
This red, that's Canada.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.938 align:middle line:84%
We sitting in this basement,
we are not in Canada.

00:46:24.938 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, the term Turtle
Island, my understanding,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:10%
is the actual word
that the First Nations

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.180 align:middle line:10%
people called North America.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.780 align:middle line:84%
When the Europeans
came over, they then

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
started putting their own
terms and words to the land.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.410 align:middle line:84%
However, it was all done
through corporations.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's why they
need the admiralty courts

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:90%
because Canada is only water.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't have law of the
land if you have no land.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.590 align:middle line:84%
You need admiralty courts
to operate in Canada

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's all water.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.520 align:middle line:90%
You need your ships.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody know where they fly
the flag on the Parliament

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:90%
buildings in Ottawa?

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.050 align:middle line:84%
On the top of the Peace
Tower because they don't have

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:90%
any land to plant their flag.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:90%
You need land to plant a flag.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the US Securities
and Exchange Commission,

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.450 align:middle line:84%
you type in the word
Canada, it's listed there.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Canada actually has to file with
the US Security and Exchange

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.085 align:middle line:90%
Commission every year.

00:47:33.085 --> 00:47:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The admiralty courts are set
up to govern business between

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:90%
corporations, not people.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The jurisdiction
of admiralty courts

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
does not deal with
human affairs.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Only when humans,
knowingly or unknowingly,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
represent a corporation
by using licenses,

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.730 align:middle line:84%
registrations, certificates,
and applications

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.420 align:middle line:84%
do they fall under
admiralty jurisdiction.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a well-disguised
fact that nearly everything

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:84%
we believe to be our country,
our courts, our police

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.730 align:middle line:84%
departments, and even the
documents that represent us

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, are,
in fact, corporations

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:90%
in the business for profit.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Should you choose to
remain a part of any

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.850 align:middle line:84%
of these corporations, it's
important to understand

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that not only are you
under their jurisdiction,

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:84%
but you do gain the
benefits that they offer.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The benefits and the
agreement of becoming

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:84%
a citizen of any country
is their protection.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.960 align:middle line:84%
To be a citizen of
any nation means

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.360 align:middle line:90%
that you have your citizenship.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This ship is a vessel
that contains your consent

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to be protected and
governed by that nation.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It was November of '07 when
I actually got pulled over

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.670 align:middle line:90%
by city police.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They had two or three
police cars there.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.670 align:middle line:10%
But what essentially happened
is he came up to the window

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.040 align:middle line:10%
and asked me for my
driver's license, insurance,

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:10%
and registration.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And I actually told him, well,
I don't have a driver's license.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, yeah,
that's why I stopped you.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a corporation.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And I do know that
I'm not here to submit

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:35.830 align:middle line:90%
to other people's authority.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it at the
time, but I was actually

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.055 align:middle line:90%
testifying to him.

00:49:41.055 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to tell
him that I didn't

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:90%
have any of those documents.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.750 align:middle line:84%
At that point, he then asked
me well what's your name.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I told them well, my
friends call me Rob.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't let a name
define me or I don't

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.110 align:middle line:90%
lead a career define me.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a name or a label.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Again, I was testifying.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.979 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have to disclose
to him my identity.

00:50:07.979 --> 00:50:09.520 align:middle line:10%
But it was enough
information for him

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.651 align:middle line:10%
to make the link between
that name and the name

00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:10%
that he has
jurisdiction over, which

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.370 align:middle line:10%
is the artificial person
that was on the driver's

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.080 align:middle line:10%
license that was expired.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.940 align:middle line:10%
And that was grounds
enough for him

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.210 align:middle line:10%
to proceed with filing
charges of driving

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:23.847 align:middle line:10%
without a driver's license.

00:50:23.847 --> 00:50:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And he, essentially, gave
me to the count of three

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to accept these or
he would continue

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.810 align:middle line:84%
filing more charges
and tow the vehicle.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And I finally accepted under--

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I was extremely stressed
out at that point

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.240 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to lose
my property and that kind

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of stuff.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So I accepted them
and decided to deal

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:90%
with it through letters.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Like if I was a
judge, for example,

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.297 align:middle line:84%
and you walked in and claimed
that you're sovereign.

00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I'm going to look at

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is OK does this guy
behave like a sovereign?

00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Did provide me with
prenotice and try

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to resolve the issue before
it even came to court?

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And was he honorable
in his communications

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and his interactions
with people?

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So at that point I start a
letter campaign writing letters

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:84%
to him to ask him
for proof of claim

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of a whole bunch of things
that he was claiming over me.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And he essentially
ignored all of those.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I showed up in
court for the plea.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.051 align:middle line:10%
Now, I know what the
plea is all about, right?

00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:32.800 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't go in there
with all my books.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I essentially went in there to
essentially say you know what?

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.160 align:middle line:90%
There is no harm done here.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.810 align:middle line:84%
There is no cause for
this court to be hearing.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The judge wouldn't
hear any of that.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.310 align:middle line:84%
He kept asking me for the
person, Robert Earnest Page.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And I kept saying well.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm here on this behalf,
because I'm not that person.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm man.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:10%
But he finally said to
me, OK, you know what?

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.400 align:middle line:10%
I'm entering in a plea.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:10%
First off, that was probably
a no no on his part.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And he told me
to plead guilty.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But he said that from
the facts of the case,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.530 align:middle line:84%
it didn't look like
I had a chance.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.421 align:middle line:10%
Then he told me, make sure
that that person is in court.

00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:18.670 align:middle line:10%
You know, I was still nervous.

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.870 align:middle line:10%
I was still shaken and
that kind of stuff.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:10%
But I left court excited
because I successfully

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.470 align:middle line:10%
got the judge to
recognize me for who I am,

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.860 align:middle line:10%
not as that artificial person.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.350 align:middle line:10%
But I still have
court to deal with.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.650 align:middle line:10%
So when I got there,
the Crown called me up.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.520 align:middle line:10%
So I went up there.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:10%
This was before the
judge was there.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.337 align:middle line:10%
And he asked me for my name.

00:52:45.337 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:10%
I didn't give them a name.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.810 align:middle line:10%
I told him I'm a 3rd Party
intervenor under injury,

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.740 align:middle line:10%
because the artificial person is
being called to court, not me.

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the one
that was injured.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:59.050 align:middle line:10%
I was stopped, which
is an injury, detained

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.380 align:middle line:10%
for an hour and a
half, and had to go

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:10%
through a whole bunch of
letters and that kind of stuff.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:10%
So he pointed to the ticket
and goes well, is that you?

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.692 align:middle line:10%
And I told him, that is not me.

00:53:12.692 --> 00:53:14.275 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was
getting frustrated.

00:53:14.275 --> 00:53:15.700 align:middle line:90%
He said go sit down.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:90%
So I went and sat down.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:19.570 align:middle line:10%
All I know is that when
they resumed court,

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:21.820 align:middle line:10%
they heard the
rest of the cases.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:10%
And then they called Robert
Earnest Page up and I stood up.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And she turned to me
and said case dismissed

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.020 align:middle line:10%
on a lack of evidence.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I move for an
immediate dismissal.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.312 align:middle line:84%
There's no sound
basis for this case.

00:53:36.312 --> 00:53:37.770 align:middle line:84%
There's not the
slightest evidence.

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>> That was a tremendous feather
in my cap because I was able

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:50.000 align:middle line:10%
to successfully stand as a man
in front of them without them

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.410 align:middle line:10%
intimidating me, and let them
know that I know how this game

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.210 align:middle line:10%
works now.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever a few men try to
take over the rights of honest

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.790 align:middle line:90%
citizens, they always fail.

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:05.845 align:middle line:90%
>> They sure do.

00:54:05.845 --> 00:54:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The created cannot be
greater than the creator.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether you believe in God,
or Allah, or Mother Earth,

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that's
your creator.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe in God.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:39.900 align:middle line:90%
God is my creator.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And even right in the Bible,
Genesis 1:27 says "God

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.210 align:middle line:90%
created man in his own image."

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, since man was created
in the image of the divine

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:84%
King delegated sovereignty or
kingship was bestowed on him.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the creator
created each and every one

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of us as kings and queens.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:84%
That means there's
absolutely nobody

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.250 align:middle line:90%
between me and my creator.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.070 align:middle line:84%
If I have somebody
in between, then I

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:13.288 align:middle line:90%
have more than one master.

00:55:13.288 --> 00:55:14.782 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:14.782 --> 00:55:37.230 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Masters could be the
pursuit of money.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Money would be one master
that I use to bow to.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I would do anything for money.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Other people.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I used to submit myself to
other people's authority

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:07.730 align:middle line:84%
without even question, whether
that be a teacher or politician

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.460 align:middle line:90%
or police or whatever.

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I
don't respect them?

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I honor them for who
they are and what

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:19.520 align:middle line:84%
they're doing in the path and
the journey that they're on.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But does that mean I have
to bow to them as a master?

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Anything one fears could
be construed as a master.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But that also means that our
creations are our servants.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.540 align:middle line:90%
We created government.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.610 align:middle line:90%
We created the corporations.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.720 align:middle line:84%
We created all the
bylaws and legislation.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.320 align:middle line:90%
They're there to serve us.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.580 align:middle line:84%
We're not completely
out of it yet.

00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.200 align:middle line:84%
We still have dependencies
on our internet connections

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and our phone bills,
because we still want

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:03.450 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with people.

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part, I've
been able to unwind myself

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.300 align:middle line:10%
from the vast majority of
all of those requirements

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.600 align:middle line:10%
that most people have.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was
very materialistic.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I was working hard for
big houses, big cars, lots

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.340 align:middle line:90%
of money, that kind of stuff.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And then when I recovered
from my depression,

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I realized that life is
all about my relationships,

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:84%
relationships with
individuals like yourself,

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:84%
my friends and family, but
also with relationships

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:43.140 align:middle line:90%
with my food or my environment.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I still
struggle with that.

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:48.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a journey.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
open a door, walk through,

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.580 align:middle line:90%
you're a changed man.

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.650 align:middle line:84%
This is something I'll
probably have to struggle

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.360 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of my life.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Every once in a while I stumble.

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But I see it for what
it is and forgive myself

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:03.720 align:middle line:90%
and just move on.

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:11.420 align:middle line:84%
That whole entire process
was a lot of hard work.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Like it was extremely
painful, took a lot of energy.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But I'm at a point right now
where if I had to do it again,

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I would because I learned
so much about myself.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And it positioned me very well
to actually get together again

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.620 align:middle line:90%
with my wife.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.290 align:middle line:84%
We were separated
for three years.

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:34.160 align:middle line:90%
We reconciled the marriage.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've been going strong
now for almost 10 years.

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe the solution's
available for anybody,

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:49.330 align:middle line:84%
whether you live in a democratic
society or under a dictatorship

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:50.140 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe the
solution is simple.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the solution
is within ourselves.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There are billions of people
wandering this globe with

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:06.390 align:middle line:84%
perspective, scope, belief,
dogma, morals, fears, desires,

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and hidden agendas.

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to
comprehend exactly

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.830 align:middle line:90%
what drives each of them.

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:15.110 align:middle line:84%
When looking at the surface
of this unique condition,

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the planet is in due
to only one species,

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.020 align:middle line:84%
it may seem as if we aren't
truly interested in freedom

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.580 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're not truly working
towards growth, prosperity,

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's
difficult to pinpoint

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:33.170 align:middle line:84%
why we're a species of perpetual
war and perpetual deceit,

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.920 align:middle line:84%
matched by perpetual heroism
and perpetual compassion.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no one answer
to explain it all.

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And yet, even if there
were, it wouldn't

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:45.790 align:middle line:84%
be the intellectual answer that
we desperately want it to be.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The most we can
do as individuals

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is to begin acting
like individuals

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.320 align:middle line:84%
instead of acting like
machines on autopilot

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:57.350 align:middle line:84%
from some primal program set in
motion millions of years ago.

00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.440 align:middle line:84%
What would this planet look like
if we took back the one power

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.840 align:middle line:90%
we consistently give away--

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.510 align:middle line:90%
choice?

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
always a choice--

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:09.100 align:middle line:90%
good, bad, indifferent.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.080 align:middle line:90%
There is always a choice--

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
love, fear, growth,
decay, life, and death.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.660 align:middle line:90%
There is always a choice.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And the picture perfect the
ending or eternal struggle

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.230 align:middle line:84%
is but a consequence
of the direction we

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.390 align:middle line:90%
choose to travel from here.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So rather than
looking at fear,

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.100 align:middle line:84%
right now look at this as
the moment of opportunity,

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
because there's something so
much better on the horizon

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but we can only get there by
eliminating the structure as it

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
is now, because the structure
as it is now is providing

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.280 align:middle line:90%
for our extinction.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.580 align:middle line:90%


01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Let the word go forth from
this time and place to friend

01:00:50.945 --> 01:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and foe alike that the torch has
been passed to a new generation

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
born in this century,
tempered by war,

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
disciplined by a hard
and bitter peace.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.723 align:middle line:84%
Proud of our ancient heritage,
and unwilling to witness

01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
or permit the small undoing
of those human rights

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to which this nation has
always been committed

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and to which we are
committed today at home

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.957 align:middle line:90%


01:01:35.957 --> 01:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to be willing to
accept what other people have

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to say, do critical thinking
to evaluate whether it is true

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.924 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:50.786 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn.

01:01:50.786 --> 01:01:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn how to change.

01:01:54.130 --> 01:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to face my fear
and confront my fear.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to be honest with
myself, which was difficult.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.478 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn how to let go.

01:02:09.478 --> 01:02:15.326 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn to stand
up for what I believe.

01:02:15.326 --> 01:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn that
it all took hard work to

A consciousness that is able
to understand how we're all

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
inextricably connected to
each other on this Earth

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
and to the Earth itself.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And that if we violate those
fundamental principles,

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.690 align:middle line:90%
we do so at our own peril.

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can continue to live in
this delusion and the denials

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
of reality because it's painful.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
It's frightening.

Sometimes it's terrifying.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's terrifying
to face the truth.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So I ask each of you
to search your hearts

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to what your truth is for
being a citizen of the Earth,

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
promoting justice as a
foundation for peace.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen magically.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
not going to happen

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.962 align:middle line:84%
by relying on these political
structures and institutions.

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to have to wage peace

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
in the most extraordinary ways,
whether our government wants it

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You will know in your
heart what to do.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But I know that without
a non-violent revolution

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, we will
not survive as a civilization

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
or as a planet.

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to have peace
if we want to pay the price.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And what more glorious
goal and value

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
do we want than
peace for all people.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I look forward to
working together with you

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
all, with we the people,
to build a new society.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
A society that understands
that we are not worth more

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:41.707 align:middle line:90%
and they are not worth less.

01:04:41.707 --> 01:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And that we will be
willing to pay the price

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and take the risks to
wage peace with all fellow

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and sister human beings.
