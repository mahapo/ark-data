For many, it's curiosity.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.856 align:middle line:84%
For others, it's
friends told them, wow,

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:90%
you have to check this out.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
For others, they have
set out on their path

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to go to deeper levels
within themselves

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and to discover layers
that they may not

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
have been able to tap into

me that the other day.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
My name is Tony Morales, and
I would consider myself a life

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:90%
student in transformation.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
Food has been my
greatest friend,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's also been
my worst enemy.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
it really early on.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I was 10.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a two hour
time frame after school

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that I was alone in the
house, and so, the feelings

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%
of abandonment developed there.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
The feelings of
anxiety, panic, not

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
being able to be alone
and just sit with me,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and feel safe and comfortable,
and that resonated with me

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:90%
throughout my entire life.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And food became a
way of making sure

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:90%
that I could get through that.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I navigated through life
hiding this big secret.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
But really, I wasn't hiding.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I was at one point
over 300 pounds.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was nothing
I was hiding,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
but I felt so ashamed of it
that I couldn't even face it,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and so that shame makes the
cycle perpetuate itself.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I connected all
of those feelings of anxiety

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
with my triggers
and understanding

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
what food really
is supposed to be

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
that I began to heal and
look for alternative methods

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.715 align:middle line:90%
besides dieting.

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.955 align:middle line:84%

very comfortable.

I wish I could join you.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to say
I was open to it,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
but then when I went in there
I couldn't get out of my head,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
all I'm going to hear
is the gong, gong.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%
That's all I could do.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So my misgivings were, what
is this going to do for me?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
How is you know this sound
going to open anything up

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in my mind or my body?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So the ancients knew about
the scientific aspects of sound

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and what it can do to one
who wants to connect with

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.737 align:middle line:84%
your higher self and with
the universal energy.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I like to believe that I
create pictures with sound.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I have different insights, or
different visions, if you want.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that can range from
memories of childhood

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
to natural settings, it's a
very broad tapestry of visuals.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like snippets of
different movies, if you want.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Envisioning or intending is a
large part of all of this work,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and I would not
exclude the possibility

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that many of the insights that
I have, and that anybody has who

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
partakes in these
meditation sessions,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.748 align:middle line:84%
envisions and sees snippets
of possible future.

It has been enlightening.

It has been probably the single
greatest connecting factor
