00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:10%
committee's records
of these accidents,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:10%
there are between
200 and 300 a year.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We have studies,
after studies,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
after studies that were
just never published.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a cover
up in your opinion?

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a cover up
in their opinion.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:10%
Facts about working with PVC--

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:10%
PVC is a non-hazardous material
made from vinyl chloride

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:10%
monomer.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.518 align:middle line:10%
VCM exposure is
virtually nonexistent.

00:16:14.518 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't plant this here.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this just happens
to be what's here.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:90%
PVC dust is non-toxic.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
These are all the things that
they send to the folks who

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:90%
are working out in the field.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:10%
There are documents
in here that say

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:10%
if we don't tell
what we know, it

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:10%
could be construed as evidence
of an illegal conspiracy

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:10%
on the part of industry to
withhold vital information

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:10%
from the government.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't you know
children was born here?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And they left all this
water contaminated.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:10%
They didn't come and knock
on anybody's door and say,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:10%
y'all need to be
moved out of here.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:10%
They just let the people
live, like, OK, they die.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that started to
really become clear was that

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
women were relating to me
about this strange problem that

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
didn't affect any generation
but their daughter's generation.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:10%
There was this increase
in fertility problems.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:10%
There was an increase
in birth defects.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And there was an increase
in reproductive problems,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.944 align:middle line:10%
miscarriages, a higher
rate of miscarriages.

00:17:20.944 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
>> And your husband used
to work here, right?

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> My husband worked at Conoco.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And we're not able to have kids.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> 1988, I'm sitting on the
foot of my mother's bed.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%
She's sick.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
On the news comes a breaking
report of a Greenpeace protest.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And the banners
read, "Cancer Alley."

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
This section of
land in Louisiana

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
has the highest number of cancer
incidents in the United States.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:90%
He said, people are sick.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:90%
People are dying in this state.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
of oil processing.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I turned and I looked at
my mother lying in bed.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd always dreamed
of a large family.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
privileged and honored

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:90%
to have two wonderful sons.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But (TEARFULLY) I had
nine miscarriages.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Factor that into
the cost of gasoline.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Make the companies pay for that.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
See how much a
gallon of fuel costs.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
People ask me why
I do what I do.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Do I tell them the truth?

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Do I tell them that I grew
up hating oil companies?

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Do I tell them that
hatred was what fueled me?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere that oil is
processed, this happens.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a Cancer
Alley in New Jersey.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a Cancer
Alley in California.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a Cancer
Alley in Nigeria.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.785 align:middle line:84%
Those people suffer
just as much.

00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:10%
Detroit used to be
the undisputed car

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:10%
capital of the world.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:10%
But all is not
well in Motor City.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the vision of
the once-great American auto

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
industry?

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Henry Ford, the visionary father
of the modern auto industry,

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:10%
grew up on a farm
outside of Detroit.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's why he
designed his Model

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:10%
T to run on ethanol
alcohol, a fuel

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:10%
made from corn, white
lightning, moonshine.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Ford's alcohol captured 25% of
the fuel market in the Midwest.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Now when he did that, red
flags went up at Standard Oil.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:10%
John D. Rockefeller, the
founder of Standard Oil,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:10%
started funding an
amendment that would

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:10%
become known as prohibition.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
That one law shut down all
alcohol production in the US,

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:90%
including ethanol alcohol.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
For 12 of the 13
years of prohibition,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Ford continued to produce
ethanol-compatible cars.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And then he gave up.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
One year later,
prohibition was lifted.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
President Teddy
Roosevelt broke up

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Standard Oil due to its
monopoly of the energy

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
market and its
interference in government.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
88 years later, the
two largest parts

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of the company, Exxon
and Mobil, reunited,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
forming a global
corporation with profits

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.187 align:middle line:84%
totaling more than all
the automakers combined.

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the North American

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:90%
International Auto Show.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The standard line
from Detroit is,

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
we can't convince consumers
to buy green cars.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, we're just
meeting popular demand.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And popular demand, they
want Yukons and Hummers.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And we just make
Yukons and Hummers

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:10%
because of popular demand,
ignoring the hundreds

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:10%
of millions of dollars they
put in advertising, persuading

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:10%
people they really need
a Hummer or a Yukon.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Good for camping.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Good for off roading.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.382 align:middle line:84%
It's really the main focus
of the Hummer for me.

00:21:26.382 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah it seems like a good
vehicle for off roading.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you go off roading a lot?

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, actually, no.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> After 9/11, we passed a law
that said that if you buy a car

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.773 align:middle line:84%
that weighs 6,000
pounds or more,

00:21:39.773 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that the government would
essentially buy it for you

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in tax breaks, to stimulate the
economy as part of the economic

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
stimulus package that passed the
United States Congress, deep,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
deep, deep tax breaks for
cars that weighed 6,000 pounds

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
or more?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It was just a list of cars.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Those cars?

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Those are just cars.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%
These cars?

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Economic stimulus.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
In World War II, we
went from producing

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Studebakers and
Buicks to producing

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Sherman tanks and long-range
bombers in a matter of a month.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're telling
me you can't produce

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
a car that gets better
than 26 miles per gallon?

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Look at Toyota.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
They've become the number-one
car company in the world,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
largely due to the
popularity of the Prius.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Toyota made the choice to
build hybrids when the American

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:10%
companies made the
choice at the same time.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:10%
They had the options.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They had hybrids on the books.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:90%
They could have done it.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But they took a
short-term view and Toyota

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:90%
took a long-term view.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I wanted a more
fuel-efficient car,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.952 align:middle line:10%
not so much because I'm
some kind of do gooder,

00:22:41.952 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:10%
only because I don't like going
to the gas station all that

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:10%
much.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> People are buying Priuses.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're buying them because
they're making a statement.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with diesel cars,
people are buying diesel cars

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're importing them
into the United States.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
After all, you
can pour biodiesel

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
straight into a diesel
car with no modifications.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:10%
I searched the whole auto
show for diesel vehicles.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I only found one, the V10
Touareg that Volkswagen

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:90%
raced across Africa.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't for sale.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Based on their experience,
Americans know that diesels are

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:10%
noisy, and smoky, and slow.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
That's not what diesel
technology is today.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
That's not what's
coming out of Europe.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
What they call common-rail,
turbocharged diesels

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:90%
are phenomenal.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Diesel engines have changed
dramatically in the last 15

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:10%
to 20 years.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in 2007, the
emissions standards

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
for diesel vehicles and gasoline
vehicles will become the same.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And of course, you're going
to get something on the order

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:10%
of 30% improvement
in fuel economy.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:10%
In some models, it's
even more than that.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:10%
If you're worried about
CO2 and global warming--

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Biodiesel causes reduction
in emissions of certain toxic

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:10%
compounds.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> In Germany, an independent
car company called Loremo just

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
produced a diesel car that
gets over 150 miles per gallon.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why,
especially in Europe,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
they've just gone hog
wild over buying diesels.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill Ford, CEO, Chairman,
Ford Motor Company.

[APPLAUSE]

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, Ford
lost $12.7 billion.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Thomas LaSorda,
CEO and President,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Daimler Chrysler Corporation.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Chrysler cut 13,000
jobs and lost $1.5 billion.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick Wagner
Jr., Chairman, CEO,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.445 align:middle line:90%
General Motors corporation.

00:24:28.445 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> GM cut 35,000 jobs.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%
They lost $10.6 billion.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Why the heck can't
all of America's cars run

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:10%
on electricity and
advanced biofuels?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.908 align:middle line:10%
>> When Detroit-- they were
shown that they would save

00:24:57.908 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:10%
millions of lives if they
put seat belts in their cars,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.423 align:middle line:10%
they resisted it.

00:25:01.423 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't
do it because they

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:10%
thought it was the morally
right thing to do, which it was.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.585 align:middle line:10%
They didn't do it
until they were

00:25:06.585 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:10%
forced to do it by legislation.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the
same place right now.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Consumers can choose
to buy the Prius instead

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of the Hummer.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And governments can choose to
subsidize the Prius instead

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Hummer.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because our government
subsidizes wasteful cars,

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the average American car is
30% bigger than those overseas,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
which means our cars also
consume about 30% more fuel.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:10%
With the largest car
fleet in the world,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:10%
our population, only 4.5%
of the Earth's inhabitants,

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:10%
makes almost half of the
world's automotive CO2.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:10%
I went to see Colin Campbell,
renowned oil geologist,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:10%
and author of the book,
"The Coming Oil Crisis."

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:10%
Colin showed me "The
Oil and Gas Journal,"

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:10%
in which ExxonMobil
first printed

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:10%
the graph that shows that our
planet's oil supply is running

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:10%
>> 1981, the world started
using more than it found.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:10%
And the gap is widening.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Colin and ExxonMobil
are not alone.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Hundreds of books, thousands of
websites, and countless charts

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:10%
show that our oil
is running out.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Even Matthew Simmons, who heads
the world's largest oil bank

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and has testified in
front of Congress, agrees.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Oil is actually
non-renewable,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:10%
even though there are some
economists that now believe

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:10%
that maybe it
really is renewable.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:10%
And that is preposterous.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
We have a society,
in the United States,

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
more than any other
country on Earth,

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:84%
has an enormous appetite for
oil for our daily well-being.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And we are blindly assuming
that the more we need,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:84%
the more we will have,
because we need it so much,

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and that since we have never
run out, we will never run out.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We consume 25%
of the world's oil.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We have 2% of the world's
oil, all of our reserves.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:84%
We cannot drill our
way out of this.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Ken Hern.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:90%
He's a former CEO at Texaco.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If anyone knows about
oil, it's this guy.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> As we stand today, it's
getting harder to find it.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:10%
It's getting very hard to find
it in a Western hemisphere,

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:10%
if you will.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you my best
example I can give you.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Chevron has announced
the possibility of oil

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:90%
being in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But the area they're
going to go drill

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:84%
in, they're going to drill
in 10,000 feet of water,

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.862 align:middle line:84%
5,000 feet of silt. They'll be
15,000 feet below the surface

00:27:34.862 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:84%
before they hit
the structure where

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.032 align:middle line:90%
they're going to try to drill.

00:27:38.032 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it, it would be easier

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the face
of the moon than it

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:84%
would be to go to that
sector of this blue planet

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
and look for oil.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.713 align:middle line:10%
>> The big question, Josh,
is what are we're going to do

00:27:47.713 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:10%
in 25 years time, when the
oil is seriously depleted?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.547 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.547 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course, this isn't the
first time we've had an oil

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:10%
shortage.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1973, OPEC
cut the flow of oil

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
off to punish the
US for supporting

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Israel in the Yom Kippur War.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
When Jimmy Carter
became president,

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
he responded by launching an
ambitious program to reduce

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
our dependence on foreign oil.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
He even had solar
panels installed

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:90%
on the roof of the White House.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We must start now to develop
the new unconventional sources

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:84%
of energy that we will rely
on in the next century.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Carter's plan was working.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
he left office, he

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.585 align:middle line:84%
had reduced America's
energy use by 25%.

00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a problem that we
will not be able to solve

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:90%
in the next few years.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's likely to get
progressively worse

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
through the rest
of this century.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> After Carter left office,
the Reagan administration took

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
the solar panels down.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> They even cut the
fuel-economy standards.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:10%
We had a nice, rising trend
of fuel economy standards.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And they were notched
back under Reagan

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.800 align:middle line:10%
just to encourage bigger cars.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The perception of that
administration was there are no

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:10%
real energy problems that
the market cannot solve.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:10%
We don't need any more policies.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, we haven't
had any real energy

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:10%
policies since the
Carter administration.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the Reagan
administration,

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
we've had this attitude of, it's
good to consume as much as you

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.670 align:middle line:84%
can because that makes
everybody richer.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it's a huge lie.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Every president, going
back to Richard Nixon,

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:84%
has watched the increasing
reliance on foreign oil,

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:90%
steadily.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Before Jimmy Carter
became president,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
he was a peanut farmer.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
What business was our recent
president and vice president

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
engaged in before
they took office?

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't peanut farming.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, President
Bush is a Texas oilman.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It was Texas oil that
put him into office.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way he
can ever pass legislation

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that will seriously harm the
oil and petroleum industry.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the Center
for Public Integrity,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:84%
the oil industry spent
more than $420 million,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
between 1998 and 2004, funding
politicians and political

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:90%
parties.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
ExxonMobil came in first,
giving $60 million.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Chevron-Texaco gave $40 million.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And BP gave $30 million.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.475 align:middle line:10%
This really begs the question,
is our government for sale?

00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:35.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:10%
Several months before 9/11,
Vice President Dick Cheney

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:10%
held 40 secret meetings with the
heads of major oil companies.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.280 align:middle line:10%
>> In those meetings, it was
obvious that the oil companies

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:10%
were writing energy
policy for our country.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Documents pertaining
to Cheney's meetings,

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:10%
released through the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:10%
were purposefully blanked out.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:10%
However, the Justice
Department released maps

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:10%
from the meetings that showed
the oil companies discussed

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:10%
Iraqi oil pipelines, oil
refineries, and oil fields.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Iraq had the second-largest
oil reserves in the world.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The maps were dated March,
2001, six months before 9/11.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:10%
>> When we tried to
swear them to an oath,

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:29.930 align:middle line:10%
the Republican majority refused
to have them take the oath.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:10%
It was outrageous.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:10%
>> We look forward to questions.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.325 align:middle line:10%
Senator Cantwell?

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, I would
like the committee to vote

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.808 align:middle line:10%
on whether we swear--

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:10%
>> There will be no vote.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:10%
That's not in order at all.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:10%
It's the decision
of the chairman.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:10%
And I have made that decision.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, I move that
we swear in the witnesses.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:10%
>> And I rule that out of order.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.622 align:middle line:10%
>> I second the motion.

00:31:48.622 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you very much.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.800 align:middle line:10%
That's the last we're going to
hear about that because it's

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:10%
out of order.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Mr. Chairman, if a
Senator makes this request

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:10%
and there's a second, why
wouldn't we have a vote

00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:10%
on that?

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Because you can't vote to
put in the rules something

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:10%
that's not there.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Here, they were preparing the
country for a disaster that we

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:10%
now see upon us.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.250 align:middle line:10%
And they denied that
they were there.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Did your company
or any representatives

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:10%
in your companies participate in
Vice President Cheney's Energy

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Task Force in 2001, the meeting?

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.410 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Sir?

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:10%
We did not.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.730 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The guy that made sure the
oil executives were not under

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:39.560 align:middle line:84%
oath is Senator Ted Stevens from
the great oil state of Alaska.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:10%
He was later indicted for
accepting undisclosed gifts

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:10%
from oil companies.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Viking grill, $5,000,
1999 Land Rover, $50,000,

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:84%
extensive home
renovations, $250,000,

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:84%
owning your own Senator
from Alaska, priceless.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> "The Washington
Post" published a list

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of the attendees.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It was a conspiracy.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And the American public is
paying a price for that now.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If we think about the way
we felt after September 11,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and why that event had
the power that it had,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a story
to explain that event.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:84%
When we lose our
story, when we lose

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:84%
our sense of where we
are in time and space,

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:90%
we become childlike, regressed.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
in a state of shock.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And you are very
inclined to believe

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in strong father-like
figures who

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
claim that they have the
story, that they have it

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
all figured out.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And so we think about what
happened after September 11,

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:10%
when we lost our story.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.030 align:middle line:10%
The eagerness of the
Bush administration

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:10%
was so acute in planting
a news story immediately.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:10%
And this news story was
called "the war on terror."

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Suddenly, on September 12, we
have a war meeting in the White

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:10%
House, where you
have Paul Wolfowitz,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.989 align:middle line:10%
deputy secretary
of defense, saying,

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.730 align:middle line:10%
we've got to take out Iraq.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Paul Wolfowitz said,
in an interview

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:90%
with "Vanity Fair" magazine.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
We just had to pick an
issue to sell this case

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:90%
to the American public.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:10%
And the issue we picked was WMD.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The natural impulse after
September 11 was for people

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:10%
to try to turn to each other
to reorient themselves.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
get out of shock,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:90%
is you fill in the blanks.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The Nexus of WMD and
terrorism has now being

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:10%
created.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.649 align:middle line:84%
There is no connection between
Saddam Hussein and Osama bin

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:90%
Laden.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.636 align:middle line:10%
There are no weapons
of mass destruction.

00:34:47.636 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:10%
>> If we think about the way the
Bush administration responded

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:10%
to that very-healthy
quest for context,

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.185 align:middle line:10%
they waged war on that process.

00:34:55.185 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:10%
>> The more we found
out what the truth was,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:10%
the more the truth became
inconvenient for the policy

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.740 align:middle line:10%
objectives of the United
States government.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There was pre-9/11, where
we knew certain things,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and post-9/11, where there
was a whole new language,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:90%
a whole new narrative.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We were starting
over from scratch.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing more
dangerous than that.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.890 align:middle line:84%
People without a past can
be made to do anything.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.245 align:middle line:84%
>> And the people who knocked
these buildings down--

00:35:19.245 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> (CHANTING) USA, USA, USA.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The American economy
lives and dies on oil.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The global economy
lives and dies on oil.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So it would be naive to say
that it's not about oil.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.447 align:middle line:90%
It's about oil in a big way.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:84%
People scratching for
food, living in ruin,

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:52.180 align:middle line:90%
it just makes no sense.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Who's kidding who with the
gods of light and fire?

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:01.482 align:middle line:84%
Who's kidding who with your
guns and souls for hire?

00:36:01.482 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Who's kidding who?

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.928 align:middle line:84%
Who's found truth
through lips of lies?

00:36:05.928 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Who's kidding me?

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.892 align:middle line:90%
Who's kidding you?

00:36:08.892 --> 00:36:10.374 align:middle line:90%
Who's kidding who?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Our desire and our need to
protect the flow of foreign oil

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:10%
requires us to spend a lot of
money on a military presence

in the Middle East.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:10%
We spend $50 billion a year.

Just every-day

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:10%

And they can't account
for the transactions that

are undertaken with the money.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:10%
The federal government,
as of the year 2001,

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:10%
had over $3 trillion in what the
General Accounting Office calls

undocumentable transactions.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:10%
The biggest problem

And ever since then,

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.650 align:middle line:10%
What this means for
the United States

is that the US is able

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.480 align:middle line:10%
by printing dollars.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good deal
if you can keep it going.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's analogous to
a cash flow problem

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:84%
which you deal with
using the MBNA credit

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:90%
card that you get in the mail.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You run up the
credit line on that

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:90%
until you can't spend anymore.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.312 align:middle line:84%
And then you use the
Citibank card that

00:39:23.312 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:90%
comes in the next day's mail.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And you run up the
credit line on that.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
The United States has been
doing this now since 1980.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's built up
something that economists

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:10%
call the net foreign debt.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
That net foreign debt
now equals more than 3

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.240 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 trillion dollars.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
If you keep borrowing and
borrowing and borrowing,

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:90%
you've got a choice.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:10%
You can either go to court
and declare bankruptcy,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.450 align:middle line:10%
or you can pick up a gun and
go rob a service station.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
The United States has
elected to pick up the gun

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and go rob a service station.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.635 align:middle line:84%
That's what the war on
terror is all about.

00:39:59.635 --> 00:40:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Until we start questioning
this basic idea of the right

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:10%
to live beyond one's means,
to extract, and extract,

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:10%
and extract, then the problems
will repeat themselves.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.215 align:middle line:10%
>> x equals y plus z.

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:10%
x is that which
makes America happy.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
x feeds America's
needs and desires.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:84%
y is what America
owns, has the ability.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So as long as x equals
y, we're in balance.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.150 align:middle line:90%
We're in harmony.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Everything's cool.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But y is a very small
number compared to x.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:90%
The American appetite is huge.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So we now need z, which is
what the rest of the world has.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're making z a bigger,
and bigger, and bigger number,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:84%
which means we have
to go out and get z

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in a manner which is
beneficial to America.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is not
dependence on foreign oil.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
Imperial mindset.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Good evening, my
fellow Americans.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:84%
This evening, I come
to you with a message

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.670 align:middle line:90%
of leave taking and farewell.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:84%
As we peer into society's
future, we, you, and I,

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and our government,
must avoid the impulse

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.120 align:middle line:84%
to live only for today,
plundering, for our own ease

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and convenience, the precious
resources of tomorrow.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
We must guard against
the acquisition

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought,

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:84%
by the military
industrial complex.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a little boy, I
went to Europe with my father,

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to Czechoslovakia, to Poland, to
Greece, and Italy, and Germany,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and France.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere we
went, we were met

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.820 align:middle line:84%
by vast crowds of people,
hundreds of thousands

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of people, who came
out on the street

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.530 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to be
near an American politician

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
because they loved our country.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't just because
my father had a brother who

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.238 align:middle line:90%
was martyred four years before.

00:41:58.238 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of people, they

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.522 align:middle line:84%
were starved for
American leadership.

00:42:01.522 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:84%
They were hungry for
our moral authority.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:10%
They proudly name their
streets after our presidents,

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Washington, and Jefferson,
and Lincoln, and Roosevelt,

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:10%
and Kennedy.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.430 align:middle line:10%
And I remember the
day after 9/11,

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:10%
when the headline on the
biggest newspaper in France,

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.980 align:middle line:10%
"Le Monde," was, we're
all Americans now.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:10%
And for three weeks after
9/11, tens of thousands

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:10%
of Muslim people in Tehran
came out onto the streets

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:10%
to have spontaneous
candlelight vigils,

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.340 align:middle line:10%
to express their
solidarity, their sympathy,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:10%
their love for the
United States of America.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:10%
We were the most-beloved nation
on the face of the planet.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And it took 230 years of
disciplined, restrained,

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.450 align:middle line:84%
visionary leadership by
Republican and Democratic

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:84%
presidents to build up
those vast reservoirs

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of public adoration
for the United States

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:90%
and for our values.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Through monumental
arrogance and incompetence,

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
these oil slaves
in the White House

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.770 align:middle line:84%
have drained those
reservoirs dry.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
the bitterest pill

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to swallow because I saw in
the faces of those crowds when

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I was a little boy,
the hope for leadership

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
from the United
States, not just to do

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.730 align:middle line:84%
good things for our country,
but to do great things for all

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln said that
America is a great nation

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:90%
because we are a good nation.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if we ever
stop being a good nation,

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.470 align:middle line:84%
we'll quickly lose
our greatness as well.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Because of our addiction to
oil, we have lost that greatness

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:40.870 align:middle line:90%
because we lost our goodness.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:10%
We put the oil in front
of the Bill of Rights.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a great
nation just because it's

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:84%
a place where you can come and
make a big pile for yourself,

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and whoever dies with
the most stuff wins.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.722 align:middle line:84%
It's good because of the values
that we're proud of, that we

00:43:56.722 --> 00:43:57.805 align:middle line:90%
pass down to our children.

00:43:57.805 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:90%


00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a crucial time for
our country and our world.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The changes we need to
make are monumental.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The challenges we face
are almost insurmountable.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Robert Kennedy's father often
said, "Some men see things

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:90%
as they are and say, why?

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I dream of things that never
were, and say, why not?

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:10%
America isn't the only country
that suffers from its addiction

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:10%
to oil.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.437 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see how
other nations are

00:44:44.437 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:10%
dealing with this problem.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.850 align:middle line:10%
The citizens of Germany
demanded renewable energy.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And their government responded
by investing billions

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.220 align:middle line:84%
of dollars into solar, wind,
and biodiesel technologies.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't surprised to learn that
one of their greatest thinkers

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:84%
had also been a big
proponent of green energy.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:10%
>> In the MAN-Museum, we
present the world's first diesel

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.490 align:middle line:10%
engine.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:10%
And also a very important part
is the diary of Rudolf Diesel.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is his
actual original diary?

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Some notes.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel
is born in Paris, in 1858,

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to German parents.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.830 align:middle line:84%
He's a shy boy who spends
much of his time drawing.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:84%
He shows an interest in
all things mechanical,

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and often takes apart
the family cuckoo clock.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:84%
On his 14th birthday, Rudolf
announces his purpose in life.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.820 align:middle line:84%
He is to become an engineer,
the best engineer in the world.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.450 align:middle line:84%
He excels in school, winning
scholarship after scholarship,

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.900 align:middle line:84%
in some schools, earning the
highest scores ever recorded.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
He learns to speak three
languages, German, French,

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and English.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.820 align:middle line:84%
In 1880, Rudolf starts
an apprenticeship

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.560 align:middle line:84%
building refrigeration
and steam engines.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.130 align:middle line:84%
He's appalled at the
inefficiency of the steam

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.750 align:middle line:90%
engine.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1892, he patents a
design for revolutionary,

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:36.850 align:middle line:84%
highly-efficient new
engine, German patent number

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:84%
6721, the machine we know
as the diesel engine.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.600 align:middle line:10%
He becomes a millionaire many
times over by the age of 40.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.610 align:middle line:84%
He debuts his engine at the
Paris Exhibition of 1900.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.320 align:middle line:90%
The engine runs on peanut oil.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
More than 50 million
people attend.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.760 align:middle line:90%
The escalator is introduced.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the first publicly-exhibited
films with sound are shown.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.660 align:middle line:10%
But Rudolf's engine wins the
Grand Prix, the highest prize.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:10%
It was his hope that
by fueling an engine

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.630 align:middle line:10%
with an agricultural product,
he could take the power away

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:18.910 align:middle line:10%
from big industry,
and put it back

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:24.490 align:middle line:10%
into the hands of the everyday
farmer and the common man.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:84%
In 1913, Rudolf says goodbye
to his wife and children

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to go to the opening of a diesel
engine factory in England.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:10%
He boards the SS
Dresden at Antwerp

The fact that Katrina
was intolerable

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.420 align:middle line:90%

And when you have warmer water,
you get more-intense storms.

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Hurricane Katrina, when
it was passing Florida,

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.630 align:middle line:10%
was a stage-one
category hurricane.

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And when it hit the
abnormally-warm oceans

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Gulf of Mexico, it
turned into a stage 5 hurricane.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.450 align:middle line:10%
>> As the Earth heats up,
more water evaporates.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.550 align:middle line:10%
And the atmosphere
becomes moister.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And this moisture in the
atmosphere fuels hurricanes.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And so hurricanes are
expected to get more intense

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.060 align:middle line:90%

It's like we're right in
the middle of the target.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The causes of global warming
are the human use of energy.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:13.000 align:middle line:84%
80% of that energy comes from
carbon-dioxide-producing fuels,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:90%
oil, and coal, and natural gas.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the hot car effect.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The glass, like these
gases, lets sunlight in.

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.980 align:middle line:10%
But it won't let the
radiant heat back out.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And so it gets warmer.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
If we burn all the coal, and
all the oil and gasoline,

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and everything we possibly can,
the ultimate sea level rise

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.690 align:middle line:90%
could be about 20, 21 feet.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And 21 feet is just beyond
what anybody can imagine.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.030 align:middle line:84%

or even hundreds of
thousands of acres.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%

a tremendous amount

phosphates, the nitrates,

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
the fertilizers, the chemicals,
the fuel used for the trucks,

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and the fuel used
for the tractor,

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the size
of Massachusetts.

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Ethanol from corn was grown
by large corporations that

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
often control the
inputs for the crop.

01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And they control the sale
of the finished product.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Because our agricultural
corporations

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
are subsidized to
such a large degree,

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
able to grow food

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
at lower than
world-market prices.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
What this means is, we
overproduce food in the US

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.450 align:middle line:90%
by about 30%.

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
That 30% extra
food actually gets

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
dumped onto the world
market at prices

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
lower than their farmers
can grow the same food.

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in this system
is farmers in other countries

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
stop farming.

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:20.680 align:middle line:90%
They give up and quit.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And they become
locked into a cycle

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of dependence on cheap
food from the US,

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.090 align:middle line:90%
which relies on cheap oil.

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Now let's assume that
our oil price doubles.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In the US, that may mean that
corn, or a box of corn flakes,

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:38.260 align:middle line:90%
goes up by 25%.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But in countries overseas,
that means that people starve.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> 75% of the increase in
the price of food has been

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
because of increases
in the price of oil.

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:55.030 align:middle line:10%
Transportation prices,
packaging prices,

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.700 align:middle line:10%
everything's gone up
because they're all

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.495 align:middle line:10%
dependent on energy and oil.

01:12:00.495 --> 01:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So then there's biodiesel
made from soybeans.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
For every one unit
of fossil energy

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that's put into the
biodiesel process,

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
you actually get three units
out in biodiesel energy.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So biodiesel, arguably,
is energy positive.

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Soybeans have a lot of
the same problems as corn.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.910 align:middle line:10%
They're grown in
huge, monocrop farms,

01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:24.620 align:middle line:10%
using a tremendous amount
of petroleum, fertilizers,

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.280 align:middle line:10%
pesticides, and other inputs.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And in some parts of the
world, to grow those soybeans,

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.500 align:middle line:84%
some governments are
allowing something

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
unacceptable to happen.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The last few years, you've
seen an expansion of soy

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:41.800 align:middle line:10%
production in
places like Brazil.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's led to deforestation.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.790 align:middle line:10%
And there's something
wrong with the way

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:50.740 align:middle line:10%
our current economic system
values tropical rainforest when

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.530 align:middle line:10%
it's worth more to
cut down the forest

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:56.020 align:middle line:10%
than it is to have a standing
forest that's providing us

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.590 align:middle line:10%
with carbon sequestration,
drinking water, biodiversity,

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:04.270 align:middle line:10%
medicinal plants, and habitat
for millions of species.

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> I've suggested that we ban
the export of biofuels from any

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:13.130 align:middle line:10%
country that doesn't meet
reforestation targets.

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What about making
biofuels sustainably?

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after all,
those engines are

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
going to need some
other kind of fuel.

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Big, heavy, earth-moving
equipment are really not going

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.620 align:middle line:90%
to be electric powered.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.330 align:middle line:90%
They need too much power.

01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:30.910 align:middle line:10%
So the diesel engine, we
believe, is here to stay.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:33.100 align:middle line:10%
And biodiesel is a
perfect solution.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.740 align:middle line:10%
As far as the
sustainability of biodiesel,

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.510 align:middle line:10%
we're just in round one here.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:40.030 align:middle line:90%


01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to use virgin
oils from food crops.

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
This year, we'll run 15
different feedstocks.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We could produce biodiesel with
waste, waste fats, waste fish

01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:52.330 align:middle line:90%
oil.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We're also developing
virgin oils out of crops

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:59.320 align:middle line:84%
like pennycress or camelina
that are weeds, essentially.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
They grow very cheaply
in sub-optimal soils.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%


01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.760 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a very proud city.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be a
significant manufacturing hub.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.420 align:middle line:10%
And over time, one after
another, these companies

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:20.100 align:middle line:10%
have either shut their doors
or they've moved overseas.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think about Erie,
there's been so much innovation

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
here, whether it's the
locomotive business

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.680 align:middle line:90%
or the appliance business.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So there is a history
here of innovation.

01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And you just got to pull it out.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>> My vision is that Hero
Bx leads the second American

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.670 align:middle line:10%
Revolution.

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Hero Bx has really been bigger
than just the employment.

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have generated
great employment here.

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:49.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The issue is that you need a
triple bottom line because you

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:51.000 align:middle line:10%
need the ecology considered.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, you
have to have the heart in it.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what allows
people to do their best.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They're a critical
component to any success

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're able to attain.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what the difference is.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.330 align:middle line:90%


01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We are clearly the biggest
biodiesel producer in America

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and North America.

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We're 10% up the
technology curve.

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We know we need a
generation-2 feedstock.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But we know there's a
generation 3 out there.

01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And our goal is to be on
the leading edge of that.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.900 align:middle line:10%
We're a fuel-technology company.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But we do tend to be focused
on biodiesel because that

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
is such a terrific solution
to what's out there.

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Biodiesel also is
going to evolve,

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and is evolving into a
terrific aviation fuel.

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:46.600 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Richard Branson, he owns
an airline, a record company,

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.210 align:middle line:10%
he even owns a spaceship.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But what he wants more than
anything is a sustainable fuel.

01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I was very pleased today
to be making a commitment

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:05.140 align:middle line:10%
to invest 100% of all future
proceeds into tackling global

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.420 align:middle line:10%
warming, for an estimated value
of $3 billion over the next 10

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.220 align:middle line:10%
years.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always believed that one
person can make a difference.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And when that one person
is a bazillionaire,

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
he can make a really
big difference.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>> In biofuels, there
will be bad biofuels,

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.940 align:middle line:10%
which may eat into
the food supply.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And there will be good
biofuels that will not

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.730 align:middle line:10%
eat into the food supply.

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think what the
environmental organizations

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:35.110 align:middle line:84%
have to be very careful of is
not to bracket all biofuels are

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:36.040 align:middle line:90%
bad for you.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.550 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make sense.

01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:41.320 align:middle line:90%


01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Today's Virgin Atlantic
flight is a major milestone

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
in the development
of cleaner fuels.

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to prove
that a plane could

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.080 align:middle line:90%
fly at 30,000 feet on biofuel.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:50.980 align:middle line:90%
That has happened.

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.190 align:middle line:10%
And we believe that we can
now start developing biofuel

01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:57.010 align:middle line:10%
for the future that hopefully,
the whole of Virgin Atlantic

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:59.815 align:middle line:10%
can use, and other airlines too.

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
What we have to aim for is a
technological breakthrough.

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And that technological
breakthrough, hopefully,

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
will enable us to drive our
cars, our lorries, our buses,

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
our planes, on clean
fuels which are not

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
damaging the environment,
on fuels that are not

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.410 align:middle line:90%
eating into the food supply.

01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
That is the utopia
we must strive for.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Did that technological
breakthrough already happen?

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.460 align:middle line:90%


01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember this guy,
the peanut farmer?

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The day President Carter
installed solar panels

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
on the White House, he announced
a new research program.

01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But if we use our
technological imagination,

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
if we can work together to
harness the light of the sun,

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
the power of the wind, and the
strength of rushing streams,

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
then we will succeed.

01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Carter administration
established a Solar Energy

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Research Institute.

01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:59.530 align:middle line:10%
Part of the research
was looking for a way

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:03.220 align:middle line:10%
to convert the energy of the
sun into a renewable fuel

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:08.110 align:middle line:10%
source that could be grown on
land not suitable for farming,

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:10.780 align:middle line:10%
something that could be
irrigated with wastewater,

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:14.260 align:middle line:10%
and would produce
exponentially huge yields,

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:19.000 align:middle line:10%
something that could pull carbon
dioxide out of the atmosphere.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Working laboratories
across the country,

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.175 align:middle line:84%
they found what they
were looking for.

01:18:24.175 --> 01:18:28.810 align:middle line:90%


01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.975 align:middle line:10%
>> One real sleeper
that's very interesting,

01:18:30.975 --> 01:18:32.350 align:middle line:10%
that may have a
lot of potential,

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:34.150 align:middle line:10%
is algae-based biodiesel.

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Our Virgin green energy team
of people are trying their best

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to see if they can invest in and
develop an algae-based aviation

01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:42.590 align:middle line:90%
fuel.

01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:44.330 align:middle line:10%
as the entire solution.

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
America is addicted to oil.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.700 align:middle line:90%
The president told us so.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%

Sustainable biofuels

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:57.890 align:middle line:10%
Another part of the barrel
could come from biomass.

01:23:57.890 --> 01:24:00.818 align:middle line:84%
Biomass as any organic material,
trees, garbage, yard clippings,

01:24:00.818 --> 01:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
agricultural and industrial
waste, wood chips, sawdust,

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:04.110 align:middle line:90%
paper products, lumber--

01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
my personal favorite,
used cooking oil.

>> This is a start of a forest.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.190 align:middle line:10%
It is also the start of

01:24:16.190 --> 01:24:17.450 align:middle line:10%
on foreign oil.

01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Another form of biomass
are energy crops like wood.

01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Since the most-dense form
of biomass comes from wood,

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
what if there was a
faster way to grow trees?

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.340 align:middle line:10%
>> A typical tree is going to
grow to maturity in 10 to 15,

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.830 align:middle line:10%
20, even 30 years.

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The megaflora tree
that we're planting

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
will grow to full maturity
within three years.

01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:39.560 align:middle line:10%
And when you cut it
down, it'll regrow

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.470 align:middle line:10%
from its own stump to another
full-sized tree in three years

01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:43.630 align:middle line:10%
again.

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:46.120 align:middle line:10%
We're growing a tree
that captures carbon.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.220 align:middle line:10%
We're growing a tree that
can be used for biomass.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that
biomass to create biofuels.

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:54.830 align:middle line:90%


01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the concept is to plant
trees in a plantation like

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.080 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing here, but
then to also intercrop,

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
meaning to plant an oilseed crop
in between the rows of trees.

01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
we'll have the trees

01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:07.845 align:middle line:84%
to harvest as biomass, and
use to produce bioalcohols.

01:25:07.845 --> 01:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll also have the
oilseed that we can

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:10.820 align:middle line:90%
harvest to produce biodiesel.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The trees were initially
developed to remediate soils,

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
meaning to take contaminants
out of the soils.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.530 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of land that
can't be planted right now,

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.050 align:middle line:10%
across the country,
that is contaminated

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:23.300 align:middle line:10%
with selenium, boron,
various different kinds

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.170 align:middle line:10%
of heavy metals.

01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:27.020 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of that's considered
what we'd call marginal land.

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.520 align:middle line:10%
The trees and the
oilseed crop we're

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.650 align:middle line:10%
dealing with clean that
soil up and allow it to be

01:25:30.650 --> 01:25:32.762 align:middle line:10%
used for food crops again.

01:25:32.762 --> 01:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
There are many,
many tracts of land

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in California, as well
as across the country

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:38.592 align:middle line:84%
and in other countries, where
we can use the megalflora tree,

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and produce significant volumes
of biofuels to help our future.

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:49.040 align:middle line:90%


01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>> According to the
Department of Energy,

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:55.070 align:middle line:10%
America could get 20% of its
electricity from wind power.

01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:58.100 align:middle line:10%
>> We now see a number of
European countries that have

01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:02.120 align:middle line:10%
literally replaced coal, and
are thinking about replacing

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.190 align:middle line:10%
nuclear, with wind power.

And I can use as much as I want.

01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%

and get market rates.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you did that,
all of a sudden,

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
every American would be
an energy entrepreneur.

01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And every household would
become a power plant.

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
