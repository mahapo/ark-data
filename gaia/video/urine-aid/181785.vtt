The only thing I can

Over time, great advances were
made in a scientific approach

century with the discovery
of oil in America.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Petroleum became
a major industry,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and with that came a discernible
shift in the world of medicine.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Modern medicine is
aided by petroleum.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Its derivatives
are used in making

Yes, day in and day out, the
men of the laboratory work on.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Major medical institutions
were offered vast grants,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
which contributed to the new
medical buildings, equipment,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and teaching staff.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
These captains of industry
and their investors

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
joined the boards,
shaping the curriculum

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
towards the teaching of surgery,
radiation, and synthetic drugs.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That title "Doctor" sounds
mighty good in front of it.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%

of the leading
teaching institutions,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
excluding alternative medicine
from the universities.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
This was ultimately to
become the standard,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and only AMA approved doctors
trained under the corporations

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
were legally allowed
to practice medicine.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathic doctors were
associated with quackery,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and the reputations of those
practicing natural healing

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
were undermined using slur
campaigns and exclusions.

I think we can hurt them.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And any discomfort I can
inflict on the quacks

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
will be a great
pleasure, indeed.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Help stamp out quackery.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Only medically qualified
doctors are able to treat

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:10%
people with cancer.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:10%
In the UK, they
introduced the Cancer Act

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:10%
in 1940, which made it a
criminal offense for anyone

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.713 align:middle line:10%
to treat or attempt to
treat anyone with cancer.

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:10%
And part of that,
you can see, was

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:10%
about trying to protect people
from exploitation, in terms

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:10%
of individuals who would be
seen as being charlatans.

where the doctor said,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:10%
if you don't stop with
your traditional medicine--

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:10%
it's the herbal medicine-- the
alternative came much later,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:10%
as we all know, but
it's name is exactly

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:10%
used wrong on both sides.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
If you don't stop that, I
don't treat you anymore.

>> Why does someone want
to pit what they have,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
which is synthetic,
against something natural,

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:90%
which really is going to work?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And you and I, really,
which we are not doing what

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%

the body.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They want Western medicine
focusing on symptoms.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if you only remove the
symptoms and not the cause,

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
you are guaranteed repeat
business will keep bubbling up.

health freedom and freedom

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
of information because I
think if people want to choose

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
conventional medicine for cancer
radiotherapy or chemotherapy,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
then they should
have that choice.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think equally, people
should have more information

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
about other choices.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:90%

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:10%
The cancers were both of kinds
a surgeon had never seen.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
You wake up in a cold
sweat, dripping wet,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.903 align:middle line:90%
and you can't walk.

00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You're dizzy, can't see
anything and you can't walk.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:90%
It's really scary.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I already have
peripheral neuropathy.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
That's tingling numbness and
pain in my hands and feet.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It never goes away.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The severity just
increases and decreases,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:90%
but it never goes away.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I've also had bleeding
retinas in both eyes.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.157 align:middle line:84%
I'm type 2, but now
insulin dependent.

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get to a
stage-- you know, like,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are
people that can chuck

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
their needles all together.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And if urine helps me do that,
I'm only too keen for that.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, urine is very good
for helping you lose weight.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
It certainly gets
everything else in your body

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:90%
back to some kind of balance.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So once I pull off
weight, my pancreas

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
might stop working
properly again.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Drinking urine for health
benefits might seem new

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to some, but history
tells us another story.

In India, scholars refer
to the ancient Sanskrit

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%
text, the Damar tantra.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Written by Lord Shiva,
it contains 107 verses

on the occult
practice of Shivambu,

One of the oldest Egyptian
medical papyrus still

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:10%

It's really one of a kind.

From examining it
and studying it,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
we found out it refers
to previous papyruses.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We can trace things
in this papyrus that

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:90%
go back to the first dynasty.

It wasn't that bad.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, within
a week or two weeks

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%

the diabetic people use.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%
One CC.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And it should be done in the
buttocks, or in the stomach,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:10%
or in the thigh.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:10%
I prefer the thigh
because it has

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:10%
to go into the lymphatic system.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The syringe-- you know, it's
an older type of syringe.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
The type used by
diabetic people.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see that this
is 100 units, or one CC.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Here is the urine.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put it here.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:90%
So I just put it here.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to make sure that
there is no air in the syringe.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't use alcohol.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I use a little bit
of urine in there

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:84%
because urine contains
hydrogen peroxide also.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, I have not--
this is not something

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I read in a medical journal.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I put together

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:90%
from my investigations, OK?

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I do.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You tap the skin so it
doesn't become too sensitive

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and just put it
in, and that's it.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen it in a
situation with a tumor.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Injected subcutaneous
around the area.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It has a very quick reaction.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
system much quicker.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It gets into the lymphatic
system by bypassing the gut.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is illegal
in many countries

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
unless it's being carried
out by a qualified medical

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:90%
professional.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Urine has substances
which quiet and calm.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
If someone was
having tachycardia,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I've seen subcutaneous
completely eliminate

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:90%
the tachycardia straight away.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.777 align:middle line:84%
I've seen someone who's
having tachycardia,

00:11:31.777 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
like their heart's
beating really fast

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.943 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
have to slow it down,

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
drink urine, hold
it under the tongue,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and after three or four
minutes their blood pressure

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
is reduced.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think
urine is a toxic waste.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Your kidneys are part of
the circulatory system.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not part of
your lymphatic system.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not part of
your digestive system.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
They're part of the
circulatory system.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The kidneys filter blood,
and then the bladder

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:84%
filters whatever the
kidneys discharge.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is in
urine was in blood

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and is not going to harm you.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually started with
the small pill container that

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
the hospital gives
you your pills in.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Progressed, within a day or
two, to a medicine measure.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:90%
A small glass, at one stage.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:90%
I even drank schooners.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Although the lady that
taught me about it

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
drinks every drop
that she passes.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I decided just to do
a glass in the morning.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll do
a little bit more.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for
me not to drink it.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.431 align:middle line:90%
Health food in action.

00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I keep a store for massage,
and washing my hair,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
or whatever else I
want to do with it.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Soaking my feet.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm preparing a basin
to soak my feet.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:90%
I do that on a regular basis.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you how
I store my urine.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.165 align:middle line:84%
To this purpose, I keep
it in glass bottles.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I've found it's been extremely
beneficial for my feet.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:29.898 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.898 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I've actually heard
of someone that's

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
used seven-year-old urine
on third degree burns.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Takes me about a day to fill
up two of those glass bottles.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've healed all
my ulcers with it.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I now keep a little
supply on hand.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's taken all
the calloused skin

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
off my feet, which makes sense
because all the correct heel

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
creams have urea as
the basic ingredient.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's also quite
good to bath in.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- it feels
wonderful on your skin

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.165 align:middle line:90%
when you bathe in it.

00:14:05.165 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a picture of
the ulcer on my left leg.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
That's halfway through
the healing process.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It was actually the size
of a large navel orange.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And this was the one on
my right leg, which was

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:90%
about the size of a Valencia.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
That's, again, halfway
through the healing process.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The doctors were
absolutely astounded that

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
just soaking in urine, no
creams, no pills, nothing.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't you use it?

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In all of Europe, they used
old urine because old urine

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:90%
contains urea--

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
ammonia, anyway, that's the
conversion product of urea.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you mix it
with the fat of wool,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:90%
it produces natural soap.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And, really, the kind of
soap that starts to foam

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:90%
and smell nice.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> This is soap.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:90%
You can wash your face with it.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It can make your face feel nice,
and fresh, and clean, and dry.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.858 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at your cosmetic
products and take it off

00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:10%
the shelf and look, you'll find
that urea is one of the first

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:10%
three, usually, ingredients,
which means it's a primary

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:10%
ingredient.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:10%
The question that
brokes, of course,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:10%
is it someone else's urine?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:10%
Is it synthetic urine?

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:10%
Is it from an animal?

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.245 align:middle line:10%
>> If we're talking
about urea, I mean,

00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:10%
you can have it artificial,
which are plants that mimic

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:10%
and chemicals that mimic
the actual benefits.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And that could be the
process with some companies,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
but its original
use is from mammals.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Urea itself wouldn't be a
word that's been created,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
but that's where
it is derived from.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a new thing.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
It is a washing cream.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
You wash your face with it.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It makes your face feel nice,
and fresh, and clean, and nice,

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and soft, and smooth.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:10%
>> General facials.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Aftershave is very good.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:10%
Generally using it
on the face, it's

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:10%
supposed to keep the face
a little bit less wrinkles

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:10%
and make the skin more tonified.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:10%
Skin and the muscles
in that area.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:10%
>> This absorb straight into
the skin and it doesn't smell.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:10%
I always have to
demonstrate to people

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:10%
and get them to smell my arm,
and they always say, well, no,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:10%
I can't smell anything.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got potassium
[INAUDIBLE] in it.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
As you put that onto
your skin, of course,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:90%
this is what sweat is, isn't it?

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got element
in urine, which

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
assists to help keep the pores
of your skin more healthy.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got spheres
there, which hydrate,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
which act as more [INAUDIBLE]
and more moisturize.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And you've got
element which assists

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
to help protect your skin.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we need to be more
educated about ingredients,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and particularly urea
and its benefits.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have acne problems or
any kind of external epidermal

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
skin problems, then urine
therapy would be a great

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
facilitator to relieve
these conditions.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I use it on my
face, my eyes, my ears.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:10%
Also when I have pain.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But all the ladies are
looking at me like,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
do you use cosmetic
or something?

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:90%
No, it's the grace of God.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> There are electrolytes within
urine that help us maintain

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
our youth.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of things that
soap and cleansing creams just

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:90%
can't do.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how we

for Mothers, and they collect
urine from pregnant mothers

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10%
every morning and they bring it
back to their factory and they

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:10%
make products out of that, which
helps other women to become

Now, what most people don't know
is that the same company also

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
extracts several other
things from urine,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
because she humbled herself
enough to accept it.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And after got through it,
our family-- we use it.

>> If someone wanted
to start urine therapy,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably suggest that they
just become aware of it first.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
What it looks like,
what it smells like.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.208 align:middle line:84%
And then when
they're ready, they

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
would pass their fingers
through their midstream urine.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Midstream is used
because the first 15 mil

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.195 align:middle line:90%
or so will clear the urethra.

00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So passing the fingers
through the midstream,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and then just placing
some of that on the tongue

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and seeing what it tastes like.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:10%
The taste will be
slightly salty possibly,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:10%
depending on how much
water you've had to drink

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:10%
and determined by the
food that you've eaten.

>> What it is is your blood.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It's your blood
plasma ultra filtrate.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been filtered
by the kidneys.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And people see it as a toxic
waste, but it's more an excess.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:90%
It's an excess.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:10%
It's 95% water, 2.5%
urea, and the other 0.5%

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:10%
is about 2,500
compounds, most of which

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:10%
are hormones, which are
messengers in your body;

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:10%
antigens, which are messengers
that cells send out for help;

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:10%
and a whole range of
things, from nutrients

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:10%
like vitamins, spare vitamins,
especially B vitamins,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:10%

Depending on the
condition within your body

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
will depend on the aspects
that are within the urine.

>> You're bringing things
in which is amphiphilic

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and amphoteric.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Amphiphilic means that
you've got substance

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which can combine oil and water
and things like that together.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Amphoteric means that what
is acid can become alkaline,

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and what is alkaline
can become acid.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Body usually just gets
rid of what is not needed.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So if the urine
really has something

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that beneficial in it, why
are the kidneys excreting it?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.715 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm outdated
in that approach.

00:23:38.715 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But I can't think of using a
waste product of our own body

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to treat our own body.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:10%
>> If you just
explain what urine is,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:10%
that it is a clean substance
that is mainly water--

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:10%
if you just talk
about the components

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:10%
and you analyze and you
tell them what is in there,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:10%
they'll be fine.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
They are sometimes
willing to give it a try.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at the urine,
it should look exactly like

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
It's like honey.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Color like honey.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
There should be not
too much bubbles.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.305 align:middle line:90%
There should be no smell.

00:24:17.305 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:84%
If there is a smell of the food
that you have eaten before,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the day before, that is
not good because this means

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that your body hasn't accepted
the food and much of it

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:90%
is going out again.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people go
from doctor to doctor,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
from practitioner
to practitioner,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and they treat chronic diseases,
and then they start with urine

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:90%
therapy like allergies.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.774 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's so easy to treat
allergy to a very high percent.

00:24:45.774 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I found out about urine
therapy from my cousin.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
heard of it, I thought

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
it was rather outrageous,
but I was interested.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:10%
So I kind of studied it,
and it took me five years

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:10%
before I actually got up
enough nerve to try it.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:84%
My motivation was that
I had had breast cancer.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I had a lumpectomy.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I was very
concerned it might return.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And from the research,
I understood that it

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
acts as an immune booster.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So I started drinking the
urine in the beginning.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
difficult in the beginning,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
but it was probably not as bad
as you think it's going to be.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I realized that it was sterile.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
That I was not going to get
some sort of germs or something

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:90%
from drinking it.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So that wasn't an
issue at that point.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It was just the issue
of, well, will I actually

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:90%
be able to do this?

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Our whole training as
children growing up

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is we're told, you know,
wash our hands, be clean.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
All of that kind of
bodily stuff is dirty.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all of
those things to overcome.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So mainly at that point,
it was a taste issue.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Am I actually going to be
able to do this or not?

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I think I started out
drinking maybe four

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
ounces of urine or
something a day,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and just the first
urine in the morning.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided
that was a lot.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I got down
to actually less

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
than an ounce, about maybe
an ounce, in the morning,

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and I've continued
doing that probably

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:90%
for four or five years.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most immediate
results that I could see

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:90%
was the difference in my skin.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
My skin improved and got
much healthier very rapidly.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed over a
period of about six months

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:84%
the fibroid tissue in
my breast disappeared.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's significant
because fibroid tissue

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
is regarded as a condition
that leads to breast cancer.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So the change in my
breasts was profound,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in both of my
breasts, and I just

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:90%
thought that was incredible.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
really lost all fear

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:90%
of the cancer coming back.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I've always been
very reluctant to take

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:84%
any kind of medications
because of the side effects.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, urine is not going
to have any side effects.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:10%
So if I want to stay healthy, I
just think it's a good regime.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
My last mammogram
was a month ago,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
and it was perfectly clear.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:10%
It was a follow
up mammogram also.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We noticed a difference-- we
don't get flus as frequently.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Very infrequent.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Very mild.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was pretty
confident that it

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:90%
was a very worthwhile regime.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as you hear
the term urine therapy,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that's all you need to know if
you want to look this subject

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you punch it
into Amazon or Google,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and all these
books just show up.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And I started ordering--

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I ordered "The Water of Life"
by John Armstrong first.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't but a quarter
of the way through it,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I had to put it down
and try my urine.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I kept ordering
more and more books

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to
figure out how that it worked.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And in the end, I
ordered over 20 books

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:10%
from around the world--

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:10%
India, England, Australia,
Germany, America.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
the mechanical how in it.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Some friends suggested,
why don't you put it together

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:10%
in a book?

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And I did.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:10%
And it was kind of a project
because publishing a book

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:10%
is a whole different deal than
dealing with holistic health,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:10%
and almost everything
went wrong with the book

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:10%
that could go wrong.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.628 align:middle line:10%
They all reacted like,
no, this is crazy.

00:28:38.628 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to publish this.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:10%
We're not interested.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:10%
Sorry.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:10%
Go to someone else, if
you even want to try it.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the first book I
put together on urine therapy.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It had so many spelling
and grammatical errors.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I had not purchased the
spelling checker on my computer,

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and so there was a lot
of errors in this book.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And this book was put
together with staples.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people
who bought this book,

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.410 align:middle line:84%
they had to open it up
and wedge it against--

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:90%
you see the staples on the book?

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Many times they had to
wedge it against the table

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:90%
and use a hammer and bang it.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Or they would open it up like
this and put it on the floor

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and stomp it because
it was hard to read.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The 1,000 testimonies
just overwhelmed me.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe that
it was a vast conspiracy

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that all these people would lie
about it and make this all up.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the books from all
over parts of the world

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
are all the same.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the testimonials
overlap in what

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
happens to people when they
started drinking their urine.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And everything that I
tried and everything

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that my friends and family
tried worked exactly the way

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:90%
the book said it would.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Also, the second
book on urine therapy,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.030 align:middle line:10%
which was more like an A to Z
book based on the complaints

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:10%
that people had
had success with,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:10%
and also gave them a few extra
tips on how to apply urine

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:10%
therapy in this
specific condition.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The types of things that
are happening are arthritis,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
like a frozen hand,
just becomes freed up.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, arthritis
all across the body.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Heart attack victims.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
All the plaque gets
rinsed out of their body

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and they start to function
better and feel better.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.175 align:middle line:84%
Hearing comes back,
cataracts dissolve.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I was very, very sick
going back 16 years ago.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Really sick.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:10%
I'd just come back from
India and Sri Lanka,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:10%
and I had lost a lot of weight.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone from a size 16 down
to a size 8 in eight weeks.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And because I had severe
rheumatoid arthritis

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.647 align:middle line:84%
beforehand, it turned
then into another disease,

00:31:05.647 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
which I can't remember the name,
but it's a very long disease.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Went to the Women's Hospital.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Got some antibiotics,
so I went home.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But then I decided to
have every glass of urine.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And a week later I went back to
her, and she couldn't believe.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely beaming.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.308 align:middle line:84%
She said, you look
absolutely wonderful.

00:31:22.308 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:90%
What have you been doing?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
so ill a week ago.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I've
been practicing uropathy.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
mean you drink it?

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:90%
She said, oh, my god.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
She said, you just
spoiled my day.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm telling you,
it made my whole day.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I just feel fabulous.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.033 align:middle line:90%
Because I had severe rheumatoid.

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:40.283 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be the most
painful thing you'll ever

00:31:40.283 --> 00:31:41.125 align:middle line:90%
go through.

00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, I couldn't
even open my mouth.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I had it in my jaw, my neck,
my arms, my legs, my hips,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:90%
my whole body.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting for this
operation for the last two

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I've had the other knee done,
which has been wonderful.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's the
uropathy, urine therapy.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
It actually helps you.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It helps you relax your brain.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm getting my other one
done today, this afternoon,

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's, I think,
the urine therapy.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.332 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:19.332 --> 00:32:27.594 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.594 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.850 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had very much--

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:90%
no pain, really.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little bit sore,
but just the slightest.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.760 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I woke up last night after
surgery start seeing.

00:32:42.432 --> 00:32:43.695 align:middle line:90%
No, it's been wonderful.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to get up
and walk in a minute.

How's your head?

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Good?

Good?

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:55.752 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

I was six days in the hospital.

Went straight home.

No crutches.

on the paper when it was--

actually practice uropathy,

urine therapy.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:84%

anything was small.

They know.

They know about it.

00:33:34.182 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:84%
But they can't afford
to put it out there

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.590 align:middle line:90%
because they can't make money.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.480 align:middle line:90%
people died from it.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The factor in my
blood was so high.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.915 align:middle line:84%
When they see my hands,
how I keep working them,

00:33:50.915 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and am I in pain.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.063 align:middle line:90%
I say, no, I'm not.

00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's when it
still leads back

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:90%
into uropathy, urine therapy.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.295 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
helping people.

00:33:59.295 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have
hands like this,

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't know that I'd
been on that circumstances.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There is not a single
condition that is not helped

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:90%
by urine therapy.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And that every single
condition you could think of,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:90%
including arthritis, is helped.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.449 align:middle line:10%
You're bringing in hydronium
and you're bringing

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:10%
in aneolic element as well.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Hydride and hydronium
irons are right there,

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
present in your urine,
and every single element

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
there in the urine is something
necessary for your blood

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:90%
to work properly.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>> In San Francisco, Dr. Paul
Kangas is a strong advocate

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:10%
to the proactive use of urine
therapy in the hope of reducing

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:10%
the growing impact of
tuberculosis in his hometown.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> My doctoral thesis was
written on urine therapy.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:10%
What I did is I compared
urine therapy to homeopathy

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:10%
and to the blood type
diet, and analyzed

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:10%
the way these interrelate.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Because urine therapy is so
useful for treating things

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:10%
like TB.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
San Francisco has
the highest rate

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of TB of any city in
the United States.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to
numerous TB experts,

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and they are not
interested urine therapy.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And I can understand that.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:24.783 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not sure where to
start dealing with the TB issue

00:35:24.783 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
here in San Francisco.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:10%
I think I either have
to start a clinic

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and get a group of people who
I have tested on effectively

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:10%
treated, or else I
have to try and find

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:10%
doctors who I can show the
value of this treatment.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Because the Achilles
heel of San Francisco

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:10%
Health Department is the
TB epidemic in this town.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:10%
And since urine therapy is just
a natural mix, a natural fix

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:10%
for TB, if I can go
to the TB community

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and just cure 10
people, 20 people,

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:10%
then I think I can move
urine therapy forward.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm doing
here in San Francisco.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Every year in America, there
are more than 100,000 new cases

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
of tuberculosis.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Of all infectious
diseases, tuberculosis

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.550 align:middle line:90%
is still the greatest killer.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:84%
In spite of public health
programs on community, state,

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and national level,
tuberculosis still attacks

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
almost as many Americans
today as 10 years ago.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Only if we fight it on
a nationwide front can

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.900 align:middle line:84%
we achieve a lasting
control over tuberculosis.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So impressed by the
power of urine therapy, Dr.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Kangas drinks all
the urine he passes.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I wake up 3:00 or
4:00 in the morning

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and I go to the bathroom,
like most people do,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I guess, and I urinate into
a plastic cup and I drink it.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.647 align:middle line:84%
I just go to the bathroom
and catch a cup of urine

00:36:57.647 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and drink it and go back to bed.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In some Western countries,
the practice of Shivambu is

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:10%
limited to drinking
one's own urine.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:10%
But in India, they have
a different approach.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I am pleased to inform
you that I have discovered

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.720 align:middle line:10%
a therapy known as
[INAUDIBLE] therapy,

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.255 align:middle line:10%
which is very effective
in many diseases.

00:37:21.255 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:10%
>> And declared
that it is cancer?

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It is declared
that it is cancer.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So I heard your name
and I searched by internet.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so [INAUDIBLE] That
is why I came here.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.650 align:middle line:90%
How much weight is reduced?

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> 10kg.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Before three and two
month to very fortify.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.850 align:middle line:84%
After this is a
10kg weight reduce.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I will give one and two
months of this medicine.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:90%
After then, I take to my mother.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And, again, to check all things.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said this doctor that
does checkup my mother,

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and what is the benefit
of the medicines.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And just to see now the
name of [INAUDIBLE] contact

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:90%
to Mr. [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.630 align:middle line:90%
He told me, please welcome.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And one time, please you
visit and please talk with me.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And after then, you
take some medicines,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.131 align:middle line:84%
definitely you will
get to positive.

00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The best time to collect the
cow urine is in the morning.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So we visit one of the dedicated
farms to witness the process.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have over
150 cows here,

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:90%
aging from 5 years to 20 years.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.010 align:middle line:90%
These are the cows I used for--

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
we take cow urine
from all these cows.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:90%
They have a hump over the top.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:10%
This is a sign of the
original Indian breed.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a scientific
reason behind the hump.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.790 align:middle line:84%
It goes into milk,
it goes into urine,

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and it has better
power, better energy

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:90%
than any of the normal cow.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The food all of which are given
here is natural and organic.

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't use fertilizers here,
any chemical fertilizers,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:84%
so that the cow urine or the
milk, which is collected,

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.920 align:middle line:90%
it's chemical free.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.960 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we
use these tumblers

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:90%
to collect the cow urine.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Whenever the cow is going to
urine, the tail of the cow

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:90%
is lifted a little bit.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the signal that the
cow would be giving you--

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
throwing out the urine in
another 30 to 60 seconds.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So these men over here
are trained, well-trained.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:84%
They would rush to
the cow, and collect

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the urine in the tumbler,
and then pour it in

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.793 align:middle line:90%
back to storing vessel.

00:40:02.793 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We get 3 to 3 and 1/2 liters
of cow urine from a cow every

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.641 align:middle line:84%
At a time, the cow does
nearly half a liter of urine.

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] 20 to 50 ml
to half a liter in one go.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The use of cow urine is
so widely accepted in India,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it makes
news headlines.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Good evening.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You are watching
Channel 4 News Updates.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for a [INAUDIBLE]
headline in half an hour.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Hold your horses, for
there is a new sort

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of drink coming to India.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.610 align:middle line:84%
A hard line group
located in Kanpur

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:84%
have designed a new soft
drink made up of cow urine.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It's called [NON-ENGLISH],,
simply translated to cow water.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.090 align:middle line:10%
The urine is mixed with flavors
such as gooseberry and aloe

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.860 align:middle line:10%
vera.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Many Hindus believe cow urine
has many similar properties

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.570 align:middle line:84%
or benefits for curing cancer
and many other diseases.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Our former prime
minister, Morarji Desai,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:84%
drank his own urine
and spoke about it

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.410 align:middle line:84%
as an alternative method
to curing all illnesses

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and prolonging life.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:90%
He lived to the ripe age of 99.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Now that cow pee drink
is still in development,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
they hope to launch soon
and take on the soft drink

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] Coca-Cola.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the concept of
drinking animal urine may not

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
be desirable to most, they have
developed clever ways of making

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
it more palatable.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we will see
the process of cow urine.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.800 align:middle line:84%
First we filter it so that all
the impurities are removed.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Then we cook it, reheat it
so that any bacterial count

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:84%
or anything such as left in
the cow urine, it can be become

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
removed so that it is, in a
way, sterilized for using it

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:90%
in these items.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:84%
After heating the cow urine,
it is again filtered, and then

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:90%
used for making the syrups.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're making one of
the ointment for the heart.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:90%
This is-- it contains cow urine.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It contains some
part of cow dung also

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and cow ghee mixed
with other herbs, which

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.216 align:middle line:84%
is used for the heart, for
blockages and other problems.

00:43:09.216 --> 00:43:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you know,
the cow urine--

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.340 align:middle line:90%
the taste is not very palatable.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy for everybody
to consume cow urine.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have developed processes
to make cow urine in powder

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:84%
form and pack it in the capsules
as well, so it becomes easier

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:90%
for the customer to have it.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:46.677 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.677 --> 00:43:47.760 align:middle line:90%
There's the final product.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.730 align:middle line:84%
This form, the
capsule when the cow

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:84%
urine and the herbal extracts
are inside the capsule.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.630 align:middle line:84%
You won't have any
problem of smell,

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.290 align:middle line:90%
or taste, or any other problem.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It becomes very easy to consume
anything in a capsule form.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Trending in India
for drinking cows urine,

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:84%
it may be because there is
medicinal things in urine.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The West extracts compounds
from urine to use in medicine.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.390 align:middle line:10%
Interleukin is used in cancer.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:18.840 align:middle line:10%
It is made in your body.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer,
it is what your body

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:90%
uses to help fight the cancer.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:26.465 align:middle line:10%
Urokinase is extracted and
used as a blood thinning agent.

00:44:26.465 --> 00:44:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's more the
religious aspect as well.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Cows are sacred in India.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Shivambu, which means,
in India, God's water.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So it has more that
religious connotation,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and is valued for its
religious purpose or value.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is where Mahatma
Gandhi, a religious figure,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:84%
fasted on his own urine
when he did his long fasts.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And probably crossed as
well, if you look at it--

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.320 align:middle line:84%
40 days and 40 nights in the
desert without water and food.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The only way I know to
do that is with urine,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and doing urine therapy.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:10%
>> There are those who
believe the Bible holds hidden

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.900 align:middle line:10%
symbolisms to the occult
messages of drinking urine.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Proverbs 5:15.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
"Drink thee of thine own cistern
and waters from your own well."

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Here, references, again,
to water sculptures,

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and fountains, and
cisterns, and wells.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:10%
In John 7:38.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.620 align:middle line:10%
"Out of his belly shall flow
rivers of living water."

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:84%
That's been changed in the
King James New Testament.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It changed it to,
"out of his heart

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:84%
shall flow rivers
of living water."

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is obviously, I
think, to try to hide it.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.018 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody
ever confuses their heart

00:45:29.018 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:90%
with their belly.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.015 align:middle line:90%
John 4:14.

00:45:32.015 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
"But whosoever drinks of the
water that I shall give him

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:90%
will never thirst.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But the water that
I shall give him

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.400 align:middle line:84%
will become in him a fountain
of water, springing up

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.650 align:middle line:90%
into everlasting life."

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say springing
up into temporary life.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It says everlasting life.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And, again, many
references to a fountain.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>> When this 19th century
Gothic cathedral was built,

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:02.640 align:middle line:10%
some people who were responsible
in the building stages decided

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:10%
to introduce a [INAUDIBLE]
of green tiles.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They've often been criticized,
and some people even

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:90%
said they look very lavatorial.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've even referred
jokingly to the cathedral

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:84%
as being in a
lavatorial Gothic style.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as the texts
from the book of Proverbs,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to interpret that in terms
of drinking one's own urine

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:84%
is to impose on it, I think, a
symbolism, which is not there

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:90%
in the context.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very much
out of context.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can say don't drink
from your own well as in,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.440 align:middle line:90%
you know, only love your spouse.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But the way the whole rest
of the part is written before

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and after it, that part is
just kind of thrown in there.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And from the way
I understand it,

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:84%
the Bible is very
much a hidden code.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be
one that sticks out,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and it really seems to
really speaking directly

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:90%
about drinking your own water.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Drinking of urine, one's own
or anyone else's, would have

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.970 align:middle line:90%
any place in what was permitted.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:10%
Far less what was
recommended or advised

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we are all divided.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:10%
We are all divided.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.320 align:middle line:10%
I am a Catholic, and some of
the priests and the sisters

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.680 align:middle line:10%
accept it.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Others don't.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
They prefer to die
before drinking it.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.000 align:middle line:10%
But I think we are
free, and God let us--

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:10%
gave us this own medicine.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.860 align:middle line:10%
>> The deeper I get in this
and I see how it's turning

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:10%
people's lives around, it's
so simple and so beautiful

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and basic, that's
surely a gift of God.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I don't care what
religion they're in or what--

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.010 align:middle line:90%
all of that stuff.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just whatever the
universe or whatever's

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:84%
applying this energy
or this love for us,

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.812 align:middle line:90%
it's a gift of God.

00:47:59.812 --> 00:48:01.022 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:48:01.022 --> 00:48:03.105 align:middle line:10%
>> Why should we be afraid
of our urine, you know,

00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:04.770 align:middle line:10%
from that standpoint?

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:07.410 align:middle line:10%
Why shouldn't we
use it as a therapy?

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is--

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:09.480 align:middle line:90%
it's disgusting.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's face it.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a body fluid and,
therefore, it's disgusting.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep to your own wife.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your own wife.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy the wife of your
youth and keep to her,

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and don't go spreading
yourself all over the town.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.467 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, is
the clear meaning.

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Hippocrates
said you treat everything

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.190 align:middle line:90%
by it's opposite.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was just thinking
that these proud people--

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's what they need
is a humbling experience.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.400 align:middle line:84%
That's like drinking
their own urine--

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:84%
on a psychological level
or even a spiritual level,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:43.200 align:middle line:90%
if you want to put it that way.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.600 align:middle line:84%
As far as a physiological thing,
it makes perfectly good science

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.400 align:middle line:90%
sense.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why such a great
scientist like Linus Pauling

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
who won the Nobel Prize twice.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:54.870 align:middle line:10%
And as Shakespeare
said, desperate measures

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.910 align:middle line:10%
are required, you know, when
you have a desperate illness.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:10%
How does it go?

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Desperate illnesses are
by desperate measures

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.850 align:middle line:90%
cured or not at all.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Meanwhile, in the heart
of Guadalajara, Mexico,

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.500 align:middle line:10%
preparations for the fifth world
conference on urine therapy

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:10%
were underway, where
doctors, practitioners,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and lecturers from around
the world came to speak

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.780 align:middle line:10%
on the subject.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The morning began with
personal testimonials

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of those who had
cured themselves

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.170 align:middle line:90%
of chronic illnesses.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
One woman drove across
Mexico to tell her story.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:50:00.370 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no desire
to mislead you.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you realize that
recovery is now a sure thing.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:10%
But if we can go through
surgery as quickly as possible--

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:24.640 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the time for
action, rather than pity.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.120 align:middle line:84%
You need to have the
will to be cured.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, medical
science will play its part.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:51:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.750 align:middle line:84%

great deal about cancer,

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.350 align:middle line:84%
but a great many
questions go unanswered.

She herself had been
tested several times

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and was in a stage where
she was severely sick,

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:84%
That includes strict diet,
using a lot of herbs,

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and drinking only urine, and
doing massage with old urine.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:10%
And at some point, she
had a healing crisis

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.140 align:middle line:10%
with, again, pneumonia.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.910 align:middle line:84%
People advised her
to go to hospital,

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.370 align:middle line:84%
but she was very
adamant that she

00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:59.990 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go through with it.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And then she went for testing
again and she was HIV negative,

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and her health severely
improved after that.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.800 align:middle line:10%
>> They wanted to
suppress the news,

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:10%
but they couldn't at some point
because her lawyer was on top

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:10%
They accepted her as the
first healed case of HIV.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:03.590 align:middle line:10%
>> People need to contribute
positively to the debate

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:10%
and to try and respect
each other's positions.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think to
respect the position

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of medical professionals,
Western doctors, and also

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.360 align:middle line:90%
naturopaths.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And you've got good naturopaths,
and you've got good doctors,

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and you get ones who
aren't so good as well.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think in both of those
worlds, you can find the good.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't legally
heal certain illnesses.

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.230 align:middle line:90%
But, OK, they lost the illness.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That's quite good if somebody
lost his cancer or silly things

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:34.030 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't say yet that
we are able to make

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:43.950 align:middle line:84%
HIV positive to
HIV negative, but I

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:48.850 align:middle line:84%
have very good
leads that urine is

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:52.060 align:middle line:84%
a very good medicine against
HIV positive for AIDS

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:90%
in the later stage.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that raising of
consciousness is a good thing,

00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and I think people need
to contribute positively

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to the debate and to try and
respect each other's positions.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think to
respect to position

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of medical professionals,
Western doctors, and also

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:12.530 align:middle line:90%
naturopaths.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with urine
therapy is it costs nothing.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has it free.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:23.490 align:middle line:10%
And no medicine fits so good
to this particular person

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.770 align:middle line:10%
as their own urine.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Our pharmaceutical
industry would go broke

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and the governments
would have a lot of money

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.850 align:middle line:84%
more for helping,
maybe, other people.

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Building maybe-- we don't
need so much hospital anymore.

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Several doctor friends said
we could save 30% to 50%

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of hospital beds.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.450 align:middle line:90%
So don't build hospitals.

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Do something nice.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to know,
this can save lives.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.970 align:middle line:10%
This is no baloney.

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.800 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is
there's no money in it.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.510 align:middle line:84%
People who do this are
exposing themselves

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:56.694 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of problems.

00:56:56.694 --> 00:56:57.494 align:middle line:90%
Salud.

>> I would wish everyone a
healthy drink with or without

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:10%
doing urine, and to enjoy the
water of life in many ways.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Be it through urine or be it
through the more subtle water

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.250 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Just the enjoyment of life
in all its miraculous ways.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.030 align:middle line:10%
>> The interesting thing to
realize is that an apple a day

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:10%
keeps the doctor is not as
beneficial as a glass of urine

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.458 align:middle line:10%
a day keeps the doctor away.

00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that's very readily

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.230 align:middle line:84%
going to come into
our classrooms

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.147 align:middle line:90%
to teach our students.
