And it better
knock my socks off.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.988 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.988 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:10%
What we discovered was that
the reward systems of the brain,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:10%
which are located very deep
in primitive brain areas,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:10%
were activated when
people received

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:10%
money, which is expected.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Other researchers have
shown that same thing

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:90%
for many decades now.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
However, what surprised
us was when people donated

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to nonprofit organizations,
were willing to give money,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to take it from their own
savings that we gave them

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and donate it to
an organization,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
the same reward systems in
the brain became activated.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And not only were they
activated in a similar way,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
they were actually more
activated than when

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:90%
people simply received money.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So that was a big
surprise to us.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:10%
There is a feeling of
euphoria that many people

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:10%
describe giving back to people,
doing charity work, and so on.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:90%

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:90%

since I rock n' rolled.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Albert Einstein?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Led Zeppelin.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, I never
know with you.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.058 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:31.016 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING): You're
wondering if I'll miss you.

00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:36.932 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.932 --> 00:09:42.848 align:middle line:84%
Oh, in my heart, you'll always
be there every step of the way.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:47.778 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:50.795 align:middle line:90%
I'm so gonna miss you.

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:55.565 align:middle line:84%
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

00:09:55.565 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Believe me when I tell
you, you're so incredible.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.035 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know
you're unforgettable?

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:90%
[TYPING]

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We've known for over
20 years that people

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
who are compassionate and
empathic with other people

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:90%
have a sense of fulfillment.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They have what has been
called the helper's high.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Mind if I drive?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.065 align:middle line:90%
I guess not.

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I need tighter, shorter
cuts if you're ever

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:90%
gonna get this on here, OK?

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.698 align:middle line:84%
I assume you have
some B roll for this?

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Put it right in there.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
People who do volunteer work,
compassionate, empathic work

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
in which they deeply
care for someone else,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
have not only a
sense of well being,

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:84%
often a sense of euphoria,
they also have increase

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:90%
in their health profiles.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:90%
They get sick less.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:90%
That's better.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, whatever.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.634 align:middle line:84%
So who else do you
have in the can?

00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have Dr.
Dossey, and Dr. Grafman.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.043 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the rest
of the interviews

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:90%
are just gonna magically appear.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I believe in this story.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's nice, Katie.
All right.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't have time for this, OK?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:90%
We-- we need names.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
We need big names.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have, like, five days to
get this going, I don't know--

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
[BUZZING]

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Katie Dawkins?

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
That's rude.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
No, thank you for
calling me back.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
No, of course.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you so much.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Can we use the studio?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:90%
That was Deepak Chopra.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:90%
On your phone?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he had time before
his lecture tonight at CU.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
He's on his way over.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
How did you get Deepak
to call you on your--

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.187 align:middle line:90%
I told you.

00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I asked his assistant.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:90%
So you brown-nosed.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
No, I told you.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.575 align:middle line:90%
I was nice.

00:12:13.575 --> 00:12:14.575 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, you brown-nosed.

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Giving and receiving are
part of the circulation

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:90%
process of the universe.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
That's how it keeps
itself recycling.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, giving people
appreciation, attention,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
affection, love, helping
others through their suffering

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:90%
actually improves your health.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
experience that

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
is the intoxication of love--

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So you were nice?

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.824 align:middle line:84%
Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

00:12:49.824 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:84%
That just doesn't usually
work in the real world.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.125 align:middle line:84%
Your body simultaneously
secretes serotonin.

00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Just give yourself a few
years in this business,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see.
All right.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
So what's next on the agenda?

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
There is the peace conference
in Estes Park on Friday.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Peace conference?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to repeat
everything I say?

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.961 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when it's dumb
enough to demand repeating.

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
a peace conference.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's the wrong direction.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin is a hormone that
totally makes you feel happy.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.355 align:middle line:84%
How can a peace conference
be in the wrong direction?

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Look, we already have
the warm, fuzzy fluff, OK?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:90%
We need some dirt!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:90%
The Dalai Lama is speaking.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
What if we could get him?

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:90%
What if we could?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could get
the house video feed.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%
We won't.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to Estes.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people are afraid
to sort of sacrifice.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:84%
They're worried about their own
well being, their own status.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's understandable.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.886 align:middle line:84%
But I think what they need to
know if they don't do this very

00:13:49.886 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
often is, you're
bound to feel better,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and to feel good when you
engage in generous activity.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
simply symbolic,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:90%
or something to talk about.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You'll actually feel good.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.344 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have Sue Shapiro
and Bettie Youngs.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.343 align:middle line:90%
We have appointments tomorrow.

00:14:05.343 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
No, you have
appointments tomorrow.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't set those up.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:90%
We still need more B roll.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:90%
You need dirt, OK?

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.775 align:middle line:84%
All you have so far is fluff.
All right?

00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
There's no controversy,
no scandal.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.529 align:middle line:84%
Where are your shouting heads?
-My what?

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Your shouting heads!

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You need a-- you need a Bill
O'Reilly, a Chris Matthews.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Where's you Bucky Frank?

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:90%
You have gotta be kidding.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't ask you.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Am I supposed to care?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Who is Bucky Frank?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:90%
He's some ass on YouTube.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
He is the voice of
the fringe, and he

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
has a huge national audience!

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
KATIE: Yeah, and
he's just plain mean.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.167 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, a shouting head.

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what you need
for your interview.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.328 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's the
direction we wanna go.

00:14:40.328 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, why don't you go
shoot your fluff interviews,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm gonna go
find a real source.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:10%
Anything we do
to turn our minds

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:10%
and our hearts in a
positive direction,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:10%
including actually doing
actions for others,

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:10%
will have immense benefits.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And it goes further than just
us, but it starts with us.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Next time you're in a shopping
mall, look at another person,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and say to yourself, you know,
that person has-- had parents,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:90%
or had parents, just like me.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
That person has people who
love him or her, just like me.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:84%
That person has moments
of anxiety, just like me.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
That person goes through trials
and tribulations, just like me.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:84%
That person will get old one
day, and get sick one day,

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and will die one
day just, like me.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:90%
That person's just like me.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that person is me.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
feel the compassion.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
negativity out there.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:84%
We witness so much
uncaring activity

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that when we witness
some caring moment,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
it's as if the world gets
put right back in balance.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It's as if, yes, that's
how it's meant to be here.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And we feel better.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's still fluff.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, you say
that word a lot.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
All right, so it's--
it's good fluff.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Anything we do to turn
our minds and our hearts

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.955 align:middle line:84%
I saw there was dust
on your glasses,

00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that
might be a way.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:10%
There was a really
interesting study

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:10%
done years ago at Harvard.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:10%
And they set out to discover
what effect did watching

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:10%
positive things going on,
a positive act of kindness,

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So they took a number
of participants

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:90%
through this study.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were young
and old, from very

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:90%
different backgrounds.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And they-- so the participants
watched a two minute clip.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.465 align:middle line:84%
And in this two minute clip--
it could be of Mother Theresa.

00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be just
someone building--

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
helping someone
build a playhouse

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
for someone, and so on.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And two remarkable
results came to the fore.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The first was that
people immediately

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.870 align:middle line:84%
expressed a desire-- you know,
I need to get involved too.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I need to help out
more, whether that

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
was at home, or in their
community, or at work.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing that happened

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
was that an antibody in
the saliva increased,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:90%
came to the fore right away.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that antibody is very
significant, because it

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
increases the immune system.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Donovan's in town.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.495 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, stopped by to see
me about an hour ago.

00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:55.662 align:middle line:84%
He's got a gig
nearby here tonight.

00:23:55.662 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Wait, wait, wait.
Donovan the musician?

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:90%
That-- that Donovan?

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:90%
He came to see you?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he came to see me.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Who the hell is this guy?

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.747 align:middle line:90%
This is Mike.

00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:84%
He's working with me
on the serotonin story

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I told you about.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
-This is Jake and Ross.
-Pleasure.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.723 align:middle line:84%
KATIE: Jake was a roadie
for Donovan, what?

00:24:11.723 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
In the '70s?

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you oughta interview
him for your story.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I can get you in touch
with his manager.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Donovan'd be great.
-Yeah.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:90%
No, yes, definitely, yes.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.682 align:middle line:90%
KATIE: Donovan?

00:24:20.682 --> 00:24:21.915 align:middle line:84%
You're sure he's
cutting edge enough?

00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about music history?

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Donovan was an innovator.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
He influenced Lennon
and McCartney.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And without Donovan,
there'd be no Led Zeppelin.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, laughing boy is right.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Led Zeppelin got started during
the Hurdy-Gurdy sessions.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So where's he playing?
Boulder Theater?

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:90%
At Paramount?

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:90%
JAKE: He's up in Estes Park.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
He's got a peace
conference or something.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.070 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can get the
Dalai Lama too.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Estes Park?

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:90%
No thanks.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
KATIE: What?

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Anytime we have a
feeling, emotion,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
thought, this
ricochets, so to speak,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of the body.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And there probably
is not an organ

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.530 align:middle line:84%
in the body that is not affected
by our thoughts and emotions.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a problem.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
If you begin with
this understanding,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.330 align:middle line:84%
it's not so surprising, then,
that positive emotions might

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
have positive effects
on the rest of the body,

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and thereby increase
someone's health.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the difficulties
in the way in which we live

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in the world today with the huge
population we're dealing with,

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and the bills that
we have piling up,

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and the family problems,
and the mother-in-law,

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of the difficulties
that we're dealing with,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is we stop feeling
grateful as to what's

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
actually good in our
lives, and we start

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:90%
focusing only on what's wrong.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, everything
that's wrong in our lives

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
starts to get bigger and
bigger, because that's

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:90%
what we're focusing on.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Positive emotions in
general are good for us.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, they strengthen
our immune system.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
People who enjoy many
positive emotions,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
who are more optimistic,
actually live longer.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we do an
act of kindness,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
when we commit an act of
kindness, when we help another

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and we feel better
about it, we're actually

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
benefiting ourselves,
not just psychologically,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:90%
also physiologically.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.165 align:middle line:90%
We do become healthier.

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:90%
How are those two coming along?

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:90%
They're going to Estes.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought he hadn't
been back since-- this

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:90%
could be interesting.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lunch.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.346 align:middle line:90%
Let me know what you find out.

00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:30.564 align:middle line:90%
Will do.

00:26:30.564 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking notes.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else you really
want to see up there?

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:37.221 align:middle line:90%
The Dalai Lama, maybe?

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:38.286 align:middle line:84%
-Hmm?
-Eh, maybe.

00:26:38.286 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
All right.
-We're good.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Tripod, camera bag, and
you're sure we're all set up?

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I told you, I spoke
with his publicist.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
She said no problem.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:90%
No problems scare me.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:90%
What else do you want me to do?

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.459 align:middle line:84%
Nothing.
Let's load up.

00:26:54.459 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Is that yours?

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.936 align:middle line:90%
Rough week, huh?

00:27:04.936 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.732 align:middle line:90%
Mike or the assignment?

00:27:07.732 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Both.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
get him to go home?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to Estes
Park, aren't you?

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Mike is from Estes Park?

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, both of us.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I went to school
with his sister.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't been back in forever.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I think he likes you.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure he hates me.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.551 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a thin
line, isn't it?

00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Come on.
Let's go.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.721 align:middle line:84%
Uh, yeah.
Let's go.

00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Have fun.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
When we watch an act of
kindness, when we see someone

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:84%
doing good to one, another
person, or to ourselves,

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
it allows us to
experience on all levels.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It brings in the energy that
is the source of the action.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And this energy is higher force.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
it's the power of our
own consciousness.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And it exists in
us all the time.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we have these that
happen when somebody reaches

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
out to us in a time of need,
or not even a recognized need,

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it opens something in us.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like a door
opens in our heart,

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and we can go in, and
experience the higher

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:90%
states that are inside of us.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
part of life.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't do those
things, it would

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:90%
be a very, very sad universe.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a sad universe,
it's a joyous universe.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.824 align:middle line:90%
So where is she?

00:29:06.824 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:90%
She said she'd meet us here.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:14.891 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.891 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Hi.
You must be Katie.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.251 align:middle line:84%
Julie.
Hi, this is Mike.

00:29:18.251 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for doing this.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you guys have press passes
to the Dalai Lama's speech.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
That's tonight in
the music at 7:00.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.726 align:middle line:84%
And most of the other
interviews are all set.

00:29:27.726 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
What about Donovan?

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, there.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:84%

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.680 align:middle line:90%
the child's about to stumble.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.410 align:middle line:84%
You have got no control
over that kind of love.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The second love, they
say, is emotional.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel good when you love me.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:08.450 align:middle line:84%
If you don't love me,
I'm gonna feel bad.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Now that can't last, because
it relies on another one

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:90%
making you feel happy.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all the love
songs are about forever.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's an extraordinary
I'm in love kind of song.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the third kind,
love that is conscious.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have to actually
use effort for this one.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:33.055 align:middle line:90%
This is not a biological one.

00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:34.375 align:middle line:90%
I-- I just wanna find him.

00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:36.041 align:middle line:84%
Just-- just help me find him.
-We will.

00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:36.872 align:middle line:90%
We will. we'll find him.

00:48:36.872 --> 00:48:48.165 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.165 --> 00:48:51.111 align:middle line:90%
Wilbur.

00:48:51.111 --> 00:48:53.075 align:middle line:90%
Wilbur.

00:48:53.075 --> 00:48:54.548 align:middle line:90%
Where did you find him?

00:48:54.548 --> 00:48:56.021 align:middle line:90%
I-- I guess he likes my music.

00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And so conscious
love is a giving.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's when the
sera-- serotonin starts moving.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.570 align:middle line:84%
By the way, where can
you get this serotonin?

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd like some right now.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.075 align:middle line:90%
Roxy, still have your case.

00:49:15.075 --> 00:49:17.015 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thanks.

00:49:17.015 --> 00:49:19.450 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: What's wrong?

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.570 align:middle line:90%
They won't let me play.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Here on the mall?

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.340 align:middle line:90%
No, at any of the clubs.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't even get in
since-- never mind.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.228 align:middle line:84%
'Cause you're
under age, you mean.

00:49:31.228 --> 00:49:32.674 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:32.674 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Look, I gotta go.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I still have to get
your case to you.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Tell you what, can you meet me
tomorrow night, say 6 o'clock,

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:90%
over at the draft house?

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Sure, whatever.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you have a
place to stay tonight?

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I found a place to crash.

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:49.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's safe?

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's safe.
Who are you?

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:53.610 align:middle line:90%
My father?

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:54.990 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'm sorry.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.251 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow night, 6
o'clock, draft house.

00:49:57.251 --> 00:49:58.698 align:middle line:84%
I got it.
I'm not deaf.

00:49:58.698 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:07.200 align:middle line:84%
What our study indicates
is that the brain

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is hardwired, is hardwired,
to give us a feeling

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.910 align:middle line:90%
of reward when we donate.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And their feeling of
reward is reinforcing,

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and should encourage us to do
that same kind of behavior,

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.545 align:middle line:84%
whether it's doing a good
deed in general, again.

00:50:27.545 --> 00:50:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, by nature
we are selfish.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But selfish should
be wise selfish,

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:90%
rather than foolish selfish.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So wise selfish means knows
objectively and realistically

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:42.820 align:middle line:90%
approach.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.820 align:middle line:90%
That's wise selfish.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Taking care more people,
other, you get benefit.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Think just oneself, forget
other, you will lose.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It's about telling
you two got here.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, it appears two idiots
turned the whole town upside

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.090 align:middle line:90%
down looking for a damn dog.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know how I hate to
be left out of a good story.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for your text.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So did you get what you needed?
-Yeah.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.987 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but we're well
past the deadline.

00:51:20.987 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So I have to cute
some interviews, and--

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.178 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:51:24.178 --> 00:51:26.726 align:middle line:90%
At least three hours.

00:51:26.726 --> 00:51:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's get started.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:31.198 align:middle line:84%
You're the kicker
story tomorrow night.

00:51:31.198 --> 00:51:34.462 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:51:34.462 --> 00:51:39.906 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING): Many nights
may seem like a dream,

00:51:39.906 --> 00:51:43.626 align:middle line:84%
with stars lined on
their streets, none

00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:46.354 align:middle line:90%
will shine as bright as you.

00:51:46.354 --> 00:51:49.826 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.826 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:84%
New friends, they may come and
go, no one will ever know--

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.134 align:middle line:84%
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

00:52:01.134 --> 00:52:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Brought your guitar case.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.780 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Hey, old on a sec.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I've got a favor to ask.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I've gotta go.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.800 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, it's-- it's
nothing like that, all right?

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.436 align:middle line:84%
Just somebody I
want you to meet.

00:52:13.436 --> 00:52:17.285 align:middle line:84%
I think you're gonna like this.
Come on.

00:52:17.285 --> 00:52:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Mike.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Is she the one?

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:90%
She is the one.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.460 align:middle line:84%
My buddy Paul here is
short a singer tonight.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So-- so I wonder if maybe
you could do me a favor

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.656 align:middle line:90%
and stand in and play?

00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:44.068 align:middle line:90%
You know I can't go in.

00:52:44.068 --> 00:52:45.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm only 14.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.984 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- is that true, Paul?

00:52:47.984 --> 00:52:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm afraid it's
true unless you're

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:84%
with your parents.
-See?

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Great favor.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.352 align:middle line:84%
Roxy, are you sure you
wouldn't like to play?

00:52:56.352 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You left this at home.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.947 align:middle line:84%
Came all this way
to hear you sing.

00:53:08.947 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Where's Mike?

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:20.220 align:middle line:84%
He has a show to
do, and so do you.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Rehearsal's in five minutes.
Are you coming?

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Can-- can I play
one of my own songs?

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:30.530 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:31.365 align:middle line:90%
Come on inside.

00:53:31.365 --> 00:53:58.518 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.518 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:90%
4, 3, 2--

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.095 align:middle line:84%
A story from our
newest reporter here

00:54:04.095 --> 00:54:06.478 align:middle line:84%
at Boulder Tonight,
Katie Dawkins.

00:54:06.478 --> 00:54:07.476 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Katie.

00:54:07.476 --> 00:54:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:29.432 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING): I knew there'd come
a day that I have to go away,

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.428 align:middle line:90%
and I guess you knew that too.

00:54:31.428 --> 00:54:35.919 align:middle line:90%


00:54:35.919 --> 00:54:45.899 align:middle line:84%
Still, it's hard to say goodbye,
and I can see it in your eyes.

00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:49.392 align:middle line:84%
You're wondering
if I'll miss you.

00:54:49.392 --> 00:54:52.885 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.885 --> 00:54:56.378 align:middle line:84%
Oh, in my heart,
you'll always be

00:54:56.378 --> 00:55:00.370 align:middle line:90%
there, every step of the way.

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.364 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.364 --> 00:55:05.859 align:middle line:90%
I'm so gonna miss you.

00:55:05.859 --> 00:55:11.348 align:middle line:84%
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

00:55:11.348 --> 00:55:16.338 align:middle line:10%
Believe me when I tell
you, you're so incredible.

00:55:16.338 --> 00:55:17.336 align:middle line:90%
Don't you know?

00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:18.334 align:middle line:90%
You're unforgettable.

00:55:18.334 --> 00:55:21.827 align:middle line:90%


00:55:21.827 --> 00:55:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Giving something
to somebody else

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.530 align:middle line:84%
does not depend on how
much money you have,

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:84%
or how many physical things
you can give to somebody.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It depends on you being
able to give your heart.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So take care of yourself,
take care of others.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.450 align:middle line:84%
We're all interconnected,
linked in a web of empathy.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.070 align:middle line:84%
If you want to raise
your serotonin level,

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.490 align:middle line:84%
if you want to feel
better in the moment,

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:48.110 align:middle line:84%
right now, all that's
really required

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:53.010 align:middle line:84%
is to take a breath, and
smile, and go, and share that

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:90%
with your fellow human beings.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:90%
We are all here together.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We want to live joyously,
and we want to share it.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:06.859 align:middle line:84%
So we start with right
now, breathe, smile, share.

00:56:06.859 --> 00:56:14.843 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.843 --> 00:56:20.332 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING): Some nights
may seem like a dream,

00:56:20.332 --> 00:56:24.324 align:middle line:84%
with stars lined on
their streets, but none

00:56:24.324 --> 00:56:30.312 align:middle line:90%
will shine as bright as you.

00:56:30.312 --> 00:56:35.801 align:middle line:84%
New friends, they
may come and go,

00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:42.787 align:middle line:84%
but no one will ever know
me quite the way you do.

00:56:42.787 --> 00:56:47.777 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.777 --> 00:56:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, in my heart,
you'll always be

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:53.765 align:middle line:90%
there, every step of the way.

00:56:53.765 --> 00:56:57.757 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.757 --> 00:57:00.751 align:middle line:90%
I'm so gonna miss you.

00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:05.741 align:middle line:84%
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:10.731 align:middle line:84%
Believe me when I tell
you, you're so incredible.

00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:12.727 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know?
You're unforgettable.

00:57:12.727 --> 00:57:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:22.707 align:middle line:84%
