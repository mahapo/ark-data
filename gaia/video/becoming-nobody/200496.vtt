00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
was fear in losing

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:90%
that familiar identity.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But there was
always also, wonder.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I touched
a place in myself.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:10%
It was behind all
my social roles.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:10%
And it was-- it was a presence.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being good or this
or that or achiever or anything,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I experienced a place in
myself where I just say, I am.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Not I am this or I am that.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Just I am.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
preoccupied me because it

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
felt like it was my true being.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like I was gypped.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I was gypping myself not
to have access to that.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So I did what many others of you
did and other people did, was I

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:56.338 align:middle line:84%
tried every chemical possibility
to try to stabilize that state.

00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
If you took this, and then
followed it with this,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.922 align:middle line:84%
and you did it under
these conditions

00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
with this person reading this
book from the Tibetan this,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
you did it after
fasting for so many days

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and standing on your left
foot it would work, see.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.705 align:middle line:84%
And I still came
down, and I kept

00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
coming down, and coming
down, and coming down

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:90%
for about seven years.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Through hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of exploration.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to India and
I met Maharaj Ji, my guru.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And I met a being
who didn't come down.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:10%
What I experienced at that time
of meeting that man-- in fact,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:10%
within those first few
minutes of meeting--

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:10%
was the experience of surrender,
which was no surrender.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I didn't
begrudgingly give up my ego.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I came
home to the place

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
where I no longer needed it.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.585 align:middle line:84%
They took over my complete
life at that point.

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't leave
that temple again,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
except to go to Delhi
once for seven months.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
They took over my food,
my clothing, my training--

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Never anybody asked or said.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.545 align:middle line:84%
It was all done from
then on from inside.

00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned about what
inside education is about.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And this man was
at the place where

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
there was no other person
you were giving up to.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And everything I did from then
on was done with absolute joy.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:10%
There was no thing they could
ask of me that was too hard.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:10%
It was austerities
that we're not austere.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I was living
almost within this man.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
For the first time, I understood
what the concept of a guru

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
was about.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
See, a guru is your
doorway to God.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Your doorway to the beyond.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
A guru is not just
a groovy teacher.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pundit.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a wise man
who can teach you things.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
A guru is a spiritual
vehicle, an entrance way.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:90%
He's a pure mirror.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:90%
He isn't anybody at all.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the spiritual
trip at this moment is not

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, a cave
in the Himalayas.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's in relation to the
technology that's existing.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:90%
It's relation to where we're at.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It's in relation to
issues like pollution,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and political interests, and
activism, and stuff like that.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that's all part
of one package now.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:90%
The game is to be where you are.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Be it honestly and as
consciously as you know how.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
When we were all with
Maharaj Ji, I decided well,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
he keeps saying tell the
truth and don't get angry.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is, I am angry.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've spent so long being
phony, like I love everyone.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
See, all the time, my
heart is full of anger.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're Ram Dass.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.281 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I love you.

00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And all the time, I'm
thinking I wish [MUMBLES]..

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And that hypocrisy was
driving me up the walls.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gee, he
said to tell the truth.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I think, for change,
I'll tell the truth.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So people would
come into my room

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and I would say get the
hell out of this room.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:90%
You're too nice.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:90%
You nauseate me.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.295 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You said something that
I would love you to tell me

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
about, about Maharaj Ji
saying give up your anger.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't work on your anger.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Don't work it through
and find out the root.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
You just said give it up.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he did say that way--

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:90%
give up your anger.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:12.357 align:middle line:84%
Working it through is
making them something.

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> The belief that--

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.901 align:middle line:90%
>> The belief.

00:13:14.901 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm righteous.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Like I have a right to be mad.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I keep Maharaj Ji as
a constant companion.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So I get mad and I
check in with him.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And he [TSK TSK].

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Although he doesn't
make me feel better.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
He just points it out.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> My Maharaj Ji in my head is
more like a psychiatric nurse.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.456 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:56.816 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If I don't get what I want,
that's as interesting as if I

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:90%
get it, it turns out.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever notice that?

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.583 align:middle line:90%
All this I need you.

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're not getting me.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.555 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, isn't
that interesting?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
And then you grow from that.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to realize
suffering is grace,

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:90%
you can't believe it.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.497 align:middle line:90%
You think you're cheating.

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
having no preferences.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It means not being attached
to your preferences.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the one.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get what you want,
you don't get what you want.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the interesting
process is the transformation,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:84%
not getting what you
want all the time.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got out
of my somebodyness,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:90%
which was very cramped.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It was like a prison to me.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
go back to prison.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like you go out
and smell the air,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
then they say OK chemical's
wearing off, back into prison.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And you don't want to go.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You say no, no,
but you go anyway.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And you go back in your suit
and you feel weird, again.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Now because you know that that
isn't who you are, but you're

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:90%
caught in it.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:90%
So that starts quite a journey.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Because my object was
to get out of my suit.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It was to get out of my
physical, psychological

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
identity, which felt
extremely limited.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would get incredibly free,
and high, and clear, and love.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'd go to India
and I'd sit in the temple

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or in meditation and
I would get so high,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:84%
light was pouring
out of my head.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I was some combination of
the pure mind of the Buddha

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and the heart of the Christ.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Which for a Jewish
boy is not bad.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
like, I'd be out there

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and I come back to the States
and I go to visit the family.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And my father would say a
simple thing like you got a job

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'd crash.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say can't go
home, brings me down.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I began to have a whole list
of things that brought me down.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.245 align:middle line:90%
Cities brought me down.

00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Money brought me down.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Politics brought me down.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing that brings
you down is your own mind.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not the city.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
The city is just citying itself.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It's being essenced city.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
What are you getting
so upset about?

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's your reaction to the city
that's what's doing it to you.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself,
interestingly enough,

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:90%
wearing a new kind of a suit.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like I'm very
high, don't get near me.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:10%
Now because I had
felt so trapped

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:10%
by my body and my personality
and was so unhappy

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:10%
in all of that,
my job, it seemed,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:10%
was to push away those things.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I tried a number of
techniques like renunciation.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I figured if I just
renounced all of it enough,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:90%
it would go away.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
All I did was end
up a horny celibate.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like giving up smoking.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, I haven't smoked in four
years, two months, three days,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and 22 minutes.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
A person will die
from non-smoking.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you push something
away, it's still got you.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:90%
You're busy not doing it.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
Every time you push anything
away, it's still there.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The pile under the
rug gets very big.

out without being masochistic.

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%

interesting than your highs

you where you aren't.

were hurt by what they said.

Years back, when I started to
do this meditation 12 years ago,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I could go off and I could
have a six-hour fantasy--

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
a six-hour sexual
fantasy sitting in Burma

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:90%
all by myself in a cell.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
with great detail.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And the subtleties of the
rustle of silk and all the--

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:90%
every little thing.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And the smells, and the
images, and the shadows.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And I just, what was the rush?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going anywhere.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I had weeks to meditate.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'd look like I was
meditating all the time.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
these six hour things.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like having an orgy.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd plan when
I became famous.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I'd have those things.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
When I became like the
Buddha, what would I do?

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%

of what I would be.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:90%
How compassionate I would be.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:90%

To the extent that we went
into somebody training,

we work out of a sort
of a deprivation model,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:10%
feeling like we're starving
and we don't have enough

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:10%
and we want more, all right?

So let's take love
relationships.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:10%
That's a good one.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:10%
You fall in love with someone.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
That person awakens
in you, or allows

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
you to touch the place in
you where you are love.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
So you say, I am in love.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And because that person
did it for you, you say,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I am in love with you.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So you say to your connection,
let's build a nest.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And where will you
be next Tuesday

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and for the rest of our--
every Tuesday from here on out?

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And where were you last night?

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And who are you
thinking about now?

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.635 align:middle line:84%
And you get terribly
frightened that you're

00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
going to lose your
connection, because if you

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
lose your connection, you won't
feel that feeling any longer,

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:90%
which you're very hooked on.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.847 align:middle line:84%
You begin to open to
that place in yourself

00:22:19.847 --> 00:22:22.430 align:middle line:84%
where you are love, which is the
same as the one that's called

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling where you
are one with the universe

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and your liquid and flowing
with everything around you.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are
experiencing in love.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while
you say, well, I'm

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
going down to the store to get
some tofu and veggie burgers.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%

You're in this place, because
you're resting in it now.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And you look into the eyes
of the checkout person,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:90%
and there it is again.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Problem-- well, now what
are you going to do?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
look at anybody else?

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get complicated.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You better start wearing glasses
with mirrors facing inward,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.260 align:middle line:84%
because are you going
to start a commune?

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you're going
to do sooner or later

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.482 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to have to let
go of the model of deprivation

00:23:15.482 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
functioning under.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Because as you start to rest in
this other space of your being,

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
this peculiar feeling

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to start
to be in love with everybody.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
You obviously can't
collect them all.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the point where
you can walk down the street

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and look at somebody and
love them like you've never

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
loved anybody before.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.365 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
do a thing about it.

00:23:39.365 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
At first you can't

And I said, well, we
advised you we needed--

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and I started to get into
this curmudgeonly, oh, "yick."

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And I broke up completely.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just saw myself
get completely ugly.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I broke up,
because what I saw

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
was that my guru had come
in drag as a microphone

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, you think
you're so high and mighty.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, try this
one on for size.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.962 align:middle line:84%
If this were around
here, could you hear me?

00:31:58.962 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you hear me
better this way?

00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of that.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:10%
OK-- what I usually
do, and I don't assume

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:10%
this will be any
different is share notes

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:10%
of what's been happening.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I always talk about
myself, it turns out.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But those of you that know,
know that it isn't really me,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:90%
it's us.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just use myself
as a case study,

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that I know better than I know
everybody else's case study.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what awes me is how
parallel our journeys are,

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and how much-- when I'm going
through something and I think,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.292 align:middle line:84%
boy, this is really
leading edge stuff--

00:32:49.292 --> 00:32:51.747 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:51.747 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.403 align:middle line:84%
--I meet somebody
and they say, gee,

00:32:55.403 --> 00:32:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that's just what's
been happening to me.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No, let's set up in here.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.222 align:middle line:90%
Let's all sit together.

00:33:05.222 --> 00:33:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in the
course of the years,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I've developed a lot of
very strange friends.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is a
being named Emmanuel.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And Emmanuel is interesting,
because Emmanuel

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a body.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.820 align:middle line:90%
He's a being on another plane.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of you here
have a difficult time accepting

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:90%
my friend Emmanuel.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd accept any of my
other friends, but somehow--

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:36.393 align:middle line:84%
you say you have no prejudices
about color, sex, religion,

00:33:36.393 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
but bodies, somehow if
somebody doesn't have a body,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
you immediately don't know
that you want to accept them.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that's your problem,
because he's my friend.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And either way, I figured is
I'll take my teachings anywhere

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:90%
I can get them, OK?

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether you got
a body or which kind it is.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:84%
If you got a
teaching, I want it.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And Emmanuel said to me
when I said to Emmanuel,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:90%
what work do I have to do now?

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, Ram Dass,
you're in a school.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.774 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you try
taking the curriculum?

00:34:03.774 --> 00:34:06.094 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.094 --> 00:34:07.486 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.486 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:90%
He said, you took a human birth.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.470 align:middle line:90%
You're so busy being wholly.

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.939 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.939 --> 00:34:14.189 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try being human.

00:34:14.189 --> 00:34:20.045 align:middle line:90%


00:34:20.045 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Funny, I'd never
thought of that.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that far out?

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow being human
was less than perfect.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though I
intellectually knew

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that form is no
other than formless,

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and formless is no
other than form.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
the manifestation

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.460 align:middle line:90%
was God made manifest.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:84%
Everything was perfect
out there except me.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.555 align:middle line:84%
But original sin was going to
have a last stronghold right

00:34:49.555 --> 00:34:50.355 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:52.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:52.685 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember being drunk with
Alan Watts in a Benedictine

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
monastery one night, if
you can handle that image.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.378 align:middle line:84%
And Alan said, you know,
trouble with you, Dick--

00:35:05.378 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're
going to get real truth

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:90%
at a moment like that.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like 3:00 in the morning--

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.269 align:middle line:84%
he says is you're too
attached to emptiness.

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:16.764 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:16.764 --> 00:35:19.259 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:19.259 --> 00:35:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:84%
If there's one addiction
that outlasts all the others

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:90%
it's the addiction to be free.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the addiction to come up
for air, to live in the light,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
to live with love,
to be spacious,

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:90%
to be present, to be ah.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.088 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see
that it can be fun,

00:35:40.088 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:90%
but you're not having it.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And you feel screwed.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And why should you be screwed?

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.563 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
shift to your head

00:35:47.563 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:90%
you got to go through.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:90%
So you get greedy.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So you start to look
for the methods.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:57.091 align:middle line:84%
And you try to fit them in,
take more time to do it, see?

00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.780 align:middle line:84%
When I went to my guru in India
and I said to him, Maharaj Ji,

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.030 align:middle line:90%
how do I get free?

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:90%
He said, feed people.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.565 align:middle line:90%
I said, feed people?

00:36:12.565 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't expect--
you go all the way

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Himalayas,
you know, and you

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
sit at the feet of
the guru, and you

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:84%
expect him to say,
come into this cave

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and I will give you
the word, you know,

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and you will sit quietly.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you will go
through and you'll be free.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.533 align:middle line:90%
He says, feed people.

00:36:29.533 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:90%
So I try a different tactic.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Maharaj Ji, how do
you get enlightened?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:90%
He says, serve people.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, I heard him say it.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.161 align:middle line:84%
But I figured, you
know, what does he know?

00:36:39.161 --> 00:36:41.616 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.210 align:middle line:84%
He's just considering me
kind of low life, you know?

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's not
taking me seriously

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:84%
as a spiritual seeker, because
the serious guys meditate.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I find it humorous
to see myself trip up.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Or I see myself
wanting something.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Or like some days, my aches
and pains are so, so gorgeous

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and then I complain.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Then I love it.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Me, complaining?

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:90%
My god, is that you?

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is that you?

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you still doing that?

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Still here?

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, still here.

00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:38.338 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:38.338 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where I feel there's
confusion sometimes about this

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these spiritual paths,
or certainly it's all about,

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:84%
we've got to control
the mind, we've

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:84%
got to transcend
the mind, we've got

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to unclutter the
mind, all kinds of--

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --the mind-- well, maybe.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find my
theory a little bit more

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.555 align:middle line:84%
advanced, Ram Dass,
if you just listen.

00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:12.755 align:middle line:84%
I haven't got just
one mind in here.

00:38:12.755 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I've got a committee.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I've got numerous people in
here immediately available.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got the eternal
pessimist, always

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
ready to paint how black
this is going to go.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:90%
I've got a raging sex maniac.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I've got a vengeful murderer
that wants to kill anybody,

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, driving too
slowly in front of me.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:84%
The victim, who's constantly
looking at everything

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:90%
as a persecution.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind is just
thoughts, thought--

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
the river of thoughts, sex
maniac-- da, da, da, da, da.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:90%
But they're still thoughts.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about thoughts,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.070 align:middle line:90%
not the content of thoughts.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You ever have an experience
where you're feeling less than

And this is kind of a rule of
the game of spiritual practice

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:35.140 align:middle line:10%
is the learning to trust one's
own intuitive heart, learning

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.380 align:middle line:10%
to trust another
way of knowing other

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:10%
than the rational
analytic processing.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:84%
That you start to respond to
something in you that knows,

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:55.050 align:middle line:84%
even though who you think you
are doesn't know it knows.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
It turned out
intuition is perhaps

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.770 align:middle line:84%
where our salvation lies,
where thinking is apparently

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:90%
where our destruction lies.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We've thought our way into
this peculiar situation, where

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
we were alienated from the
Earth and from each other,

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and caught in greed, which
is a product of the mind.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And each of us must
be true to ourselves

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to hear what is our
unique way through,

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.050 align:middle line:84%
because if you get
phony wholly, it ends up

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.235 align:middle line:90%
kicking you in the butt.

00:48:28.235 --> 00:48:29.735 align:middle line:84%
You've got to stay
true to yourself.

00:48:29.735 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And as Chogyam Trungpa said
in his rascally way, he said,

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:40.460 align:middle line:84%
"Enlightenment is the ego's
ultimate disappointment."

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's the predicament.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You see the fact that
your spiritual journey

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:84%
is an entirely different
ballgame than the one you

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:90%
thought you were on.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a different path than
you thought you were on.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to
make that transition.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't want to.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They want to take the power
from their spiritual work

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.450 align:middle line:90%
and make their life nice.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is a grief when
who you thought you were it

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.020 align:middle line:90%
starts to disappear.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:12.880 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a picture
frame in which there is

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.205 align:middle line:90%
of a painting of a gray cloud.

00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But the painter made the
cloud bigger than the frame

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:90%
that he had--

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:90%
she had.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was they
cut a little off the edge,

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and they just put
it in the frame

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.843 align:middle line:84%
until all there is
is gray cloudiness,

00:49:34.843 --> 00:49:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because there's no edge
anymore to the clouds.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.307 align:middle line:84%
So all you have is
gray in a frame.

00:49:39.307 --> 00:49:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And you look at it and
you say, what's that?

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you used either
a little bigger frame

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.240 align:middle line:84%
or painted a little
smaller cloud,

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.120 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that there's
a little blue sky

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.330 align:middle line:90%
around the edge of the cloud.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And you'd say, oh, a cloud.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.180 align:middle line:84%
All the time I thought
the universe was gray.

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> The cloud is the grief.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle line:90%
The cloud is the self pity.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.630 align:middle line:90%
The cloud of the models.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.305 align:middle line:84%
And that little blue
sky becomes the space.

00:50:22.305 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Meditative techniques
are designed

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:90%
to give you that space.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And the minute there's
that spaciousness,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.380 align:middle line:90%
it's just another cloud.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You know what clouds
do in the sky?

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.700 align:middle line:90%
They come and they go.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.480 align:middle line:10%
And then there
comes a period where

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.140 align:middle line:10%
you've just gone through
enough, and the space starts--

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:10%
that little blue sky
starts to develop.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a meditative
awareness, or just

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:05.545 align:middle line:84%
that appreciation, you start
to identify with the blue sky

00:51:05.545 --> 00:51:06.420 align:middle line:90%
instead of the cloud.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:14.450 align:middle line:84%
You flicker at first, and
then you start to release.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the
time when you start

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to realize you'd rather
be vulnerable and be hurt

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.060 align:middle line:84%
than be living dead in
the dead, dead sense,

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:90%
not in the living sense.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And you can't afford it.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And you start to open
again, and the whole cycle

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:40.990 align:middle line:84%
starts again, until
finally, you start

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:90%
to fall in love with love.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.174 align:middle line:90%

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:03.075 align:middle line:84%
>> When you take off your mask,
it's easier from everybody else

00:52:03.075 --> 00:52:05.488 align:middle line:90%
to take off theirs.

00:52:05.488 --> 00:52:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I want to be a

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.180 align:middle line:90%
removal.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but there are cultures
that are so mask driven.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what an office
would be like with no masks.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the irony about masks.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I've had a fascination with
masks since first hanging out

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.260 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:35.570 align:middle line:10%
The irony is that we wear a
mask because the people around

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.990 align:middle line:10%
will only love us if
we wear this mask.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But the crazy thing
about that is we

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:44.390 align:middle line:84%
don't really want to hang out
with people that only want

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:84%
the masks on, so we're
exhausting ourself

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.580 align:middle line:84%
wearing a mask for people we
don't want to hang out with.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And we take off the
mask and some will go.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But the people that
will be left are

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.175 align:middle line:84%
the people that love
us and really want

00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to hang out with us.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:52:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.440 align:middle line:90%
That's just right, just right.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's playing
with their stories,

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
who they think they are.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It's more fun to
just witness it all,

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:24.058 align:middle line:84%
to be the environment in
which this stuff is happening.

>> We are living in a time

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.480 align:middle line:84%
acceptable to consider the
possibility that people

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:90%
actually die.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Usually, in our culture, it
has been put behind doors,

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.010 align:middle line:90%
behind sheets, behind--

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.840 align:middle line:84%
you don't talk to the
children about it.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:90%
You don't show anybody.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.520 align:middle line:10%
We surround people
that are dying

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.690 align:middle line:10%
with a certain kind of falseness
that comes out of our own fear.

When my mother, my
natural mother was dying,

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.882 align:middle line:84%
and I'd watch people come into
the room-- all the relatives

00:54:05.882 --> 00:54:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and doctors and nurses
saying, you're looking better,

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:09.060 align:middle line:90%
you're doing well.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.727 align:middle line:84%
And then they go out
of the room and say

00:54:10.727 --> 00:54:12.900 align:middle line:90%
she won't live the week.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought how bizarre
that a human being

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is going through one of the
most profound transitions

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.670 align:middle line:84%
in their life, and they're
surrounded completely

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.500 align:middle line:90%
by deception?

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you hear the pain of that,
that nobody could be straight

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with them, because everybody was
too frightened, even the rabbi,

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.190 align:middle line:84%
all of them,
everybody, everybody.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And for me, who has
grown up in that culture,

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:40.050 align:middle line:84%
it was quite an experience when
I started to live in India,

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:44.220 align:middle line:84%
where when somebody dies,
they are put on a pallet

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and then carried through the
streets to the burning grounds.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And the death is public
for everybody to see.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:90%
The body is right there.

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not in a box.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not hidden.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Most people are dying at home.

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So that most people,
as they grow up,

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.930 align:middle line:84%
have been in the presence
of someone dying.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:10.920 align:middle line:84%
While in our culture, an
amazing number of people,

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:84%
even at middle age, have
never been in the presence

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:90%
of someone dying.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.146 align:middle line:84%
They have walked away from
it and hidden from it.

00:55:18.146 --> 00:55:24.470 align:middle line:90%


00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Dear friend, please
know as you pass by,

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:35.380 align:middle line:84%
as you are now, so once was I.
As I am now, so you will be,

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:90%
prepare yourself to follow me.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.311 align:middle line:90%
And we are preparing ourselves.

00:55:42.311 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of the
strange people that

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:84%
absolutely delights and
enjoys being with people

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:90%
as they're dying.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:03.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is such
incredible grace for me

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that in the morning
when I know I'm

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:06.740 align:middle line:84%
going to be with
such a person, I

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:12.770 align:middle line:84%
get absolutely thrilled
in my body and my being,

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:15.080 align:middle line:84%
because I know I'm going
to have an opportunity

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.535 align:middle line:90%
to be in the presence of truth.

00:56:16.535 --> 00:56:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.550 align:middle line:10%
While I wouldn't lay
suffering on anybody,

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.540 align:middle line:10%
I have sat with people that
are suffering incredibly

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:10%
with various kinds of
cancer and other kinds

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.420 align:middle line:10%
of physical conditions.

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.180 align:middle line:10%
And I will tell you that I
have watched people with egos

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.950 align:middle line:10%
that are like cinder blocks.

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They're so heavy and thick
and busy with themselves

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.044 align:middle line:84%
and their self-pity and their
anger and their ah, ah, ah.

00:56:47.044 --> 00:56:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched the suffering
eat away and eat away

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and eat away and eat away.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I've watched--
it's like the shell cracks.

00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
spirit is born.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And I see them often
very close to death.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are like great,
wise, spiritual beings.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think there was
a chance of a snowball in hell

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that person was ever going to
come up for air spiritually

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:16.030 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are eager to
take away people's pain.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But from a spiritual
point of view,

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I look and I see the way
in which pain deepens

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.060 align:middle line:90%
compassion and pain awakens.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.560 align:middle line:90%
What am I to do?

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Are doctor's evil?

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.487 align:middle line:90%
Are they good?

00:57:30.487 --> 00:57:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think they
should ask the patient,

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.450 align:middle line:84%
do you want to get
rid of your pain?

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all
very interesting issues

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.780 align:middle line:84%
about how you help without
getting caught and being

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.660 align:middle line:84%
a helper, and seeing the other
person as somebody that needs

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.940 align:middle line:90%
help and still helping them.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I said to
Emmanuel, Emmanuel,

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I deal a lot with
the fear of dying

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.350 align:middle line:90%
in this culture and death.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:59.200 align:middle line:90%
What should I tell people?

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Ram Dass, tell them
that death is absolutely safe.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.892 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:07.892 --> 00:58:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I just put those two things
together and realize what

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.870 align:middle line:90%
a far out line that is.

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Death is absolutely safe.

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And then he added
one more image.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.845 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's like
taking off a tight shoe.

00:58:18.845 --> 00:58:21.530 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear that one?

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Like taking off a tight shoe.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, just imagine that you,
as spirit or awareness,

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:32.450 align:middle line:84%
have contained yourself
in an incarnation,

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:36.080 align:middle line:84%
or contained it in a
conceptual model of who you are

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and on storyline.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point,
you dissolve out of that.

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You break out of that, and there
is this incredible relationship

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:46.786 align:middle line:90%
quality.

00:58:46.786 --> 00:58:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I came into the room,
and Jeannie had cancer

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:55.800 align:middle line:90%
of the cervix, very painful.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.340 align:middle line:90%
She was writhing in pain.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a collaborative process
with the doctor and she

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and Laura, all deciding pain
medicine and how long she'd

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.710 align:middle line:90%
live and things.

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I came in, and I
sat down and she usually

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.180 align:middle line:84%
would fight me tooth and
nail, because she was

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.190 align:middle line:90%
very much of an intellectual.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But she was so
weak this time, she

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.910 align:middle line:90%
was just writhing on the bed.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down next
to the bed and I just

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:20.490 align:middle line:84%
did this meditation,
the Buddhist meditation

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.190 align:middle line:90%
that is done in cemeteries.

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually they have
a bloated corpse,

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or a fly-infested corpse, or
a skeleton to meditate upon.

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.770 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I just had
this decaying body before me.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat,
allowing it to exist,

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.020 align:middle line:84%
watching all my emotional
reactions to it,

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.290 align:middle line:90%
just allowing it to exist.

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And I became so peaceful.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And the room was so clear.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a purpley
light in the room.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And she turned to me,
all the time her body

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is writhing in pain,
and she says to me,

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt so much
ecstasy in my life.

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't rather be anywhere
else than here at this moment.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.680 align:middle line:90%


01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And she sits up
and she is radiant.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And she comes over
and she starts

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:14.190 align:middle line:84%
to stroke my face as if she
is looking at a human being,

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.780 align:middle line:90%
at this phenomenon of a body.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And she's tenderly stroking it.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And I stroke her face.

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And then she comes
up and she kisses me.

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And I kiss her and
we hold each other.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.900 align:middle line:90%


01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a moment
that is absolutely

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.350 align:middle line:90%
perfect in his presence.

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the little tiny
thought forms in my head like,

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
well, this is the next thing
to necrophilia, you know.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you know her
husband is downstairs?

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They're Quakers.

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.558 align:middle line:90%
What will they think of this?

01:00:50.558 --> 01:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, all those little
"niggily, piggily" things

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in my head were just like
little lights around the edge.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have much
juice to them, you know,

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.650 align:middle line:84%
because the whole thing
was just what it was.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It was actually perfect.

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And then she laid
back on the pillow,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.268 align:middle line:84%
and we held hands
about 10 or 15 minutes.

01:01:08.268 --> 01:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, Jean, you
understand everything I do.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
sense wasting time.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
See you around,
namaste, namaste.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And I flew down to
New York that night,

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and the next morning
at 7:00 I got a call.

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:21.613 align:middle line:90%
She died during the night.

01:01:21.613 --> 01:01:27.090 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The more you are aware of
the spiritual nature of life,

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
the more you see the moment of
death as a moment for release,

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
for taking off the tight shoe.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And the art form in dying is
that, at the moment of death,

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:58.710 align:middle line:10%
you are neither grabbing at
life, nor pushing it away.

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
You are neither
pushing, nor pulling.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the attraction and aversion
that keeps you holding to form.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So to prepare for the moment of
death, when the processes that

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
go on in consciousness are
a dissolving of boundaries,

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
a speeding up of awareness,
an opening and expanding,

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to be in that process where
you don't go, no and grab hold,

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.300 align:middle line:90%
one prepares.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
One prepares for
the moment of death.

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:45.800 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes seeking in itself
is just an expression of lack.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, suppression of lack.

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> An abundance of
lack, so abundant.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Abundance of lack.

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:02.540 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.905 align:middle line:84%
>> His Royal majesty,
the abundance of lack.

01:03:04.905 --> 01:03:07.425 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:08.486 align:middle line:90%


01:03:08.486 --> 01:03:09.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Abundance of lack.

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.230 align:middle line:90%


01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.090 align:middle line:90%


01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:19.850 align:middle line:10%
>> If you had a little
television receiver channel

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:23.750 align:middle line:10%
right here next your
eyes, what you're finding,

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:27.710 align:middle line:10%
what we're talking about
is planes of consciousness,

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:30.530 align:middle line:10%
or channels on a television set.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And most of us most of
the time in this culture,

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
act as if we have a
one- or two-channel set.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't have cable.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
talking about cable.

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.688 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about acknowledging

01:03:47.688 --> 01:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
all these other channels
that are floating around

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
in the room, but we're
not picking them up

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.338 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
how to tune our receiver.

01:03:53.338 --> 01:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what this is about.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So on the first channel, when
you look at another human

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
being, you see old, young, dark,
light, fat, thin, et cetera.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You see physical body.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.962 align:middle line:84%
And if you're obsessed with
your physical body, that's

01:04:11.962 --> 01:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
what you see when you
look in the world--

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.320 align:middle line:90%
other people's physical bodies.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the channel you're on.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
If you flip one
channel, then you're

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:25.130 align:middle line:90%
in the psychosocial realm.

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
You see power.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And you see happiness
and sadness and neurosis.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's the therapy channel.

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the social
role channel.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It's where there are mothers and
truck drivers and all lawyers

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and all the different
roles and identities,

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
all the social stuff.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's all a channel.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And that says the world turns.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a never ending
source of fascination.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just goes on
and on and on and on.

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
happy with channel 2.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
In channel one
and two, about 98%

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of the people you've ever
known are busy with those two

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
channels all the time.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
If you flip to the
next channel, you

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
go behind all those
individual differences,

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and you just see
another soul just

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
like you that has all
that packaging that's

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
different than you, but is just
another being just like you.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
That's when you say,
are you in there?

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm in here.

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:27.930 align:middle line:90%
How'd you get in that one?

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, our predicament
is that as long

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
as you're on channel one and
two, you are afraid of death.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you identify
with that which dies,

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
there is always fear
of death, because it's

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
the fear of cessation
of existence.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:50.850 align:middle line:10%
Until you are rooted in these
other levels of reality,

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:54.540 align:middle line:10%
that gives you a
perspective about death

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:59.335 align:middle line:10%
that allows you to see death
as a transformation of things

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:00.135 align:middle line:10%
which change.

01:06:00.135 --> 01:06:05.620 align:middle line:90%


01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there still an excitement
about it, about death?

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited about
what happens after death.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not excited about death.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:18.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In your language, my
incarnation has been using

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
your incarnation
for certain things.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Like the first time I
met you, I had probably

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
realized that I wasn't going
to get the male transmission

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.030 align:middle line:90%
from my father.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I didn't
want to take my leave of you

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
so abruptly as it
had been with my dad.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.400 align:middle line:90%


01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a projection of you.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:59.440 align:middle line:90%


01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that projection,
you don't want to lose,

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
whether it's father figure or
the spiritual, or something.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I see you as a spiritual entity.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:21.846 align:middle line:84%
And do you see yourself
as a [GESTURES]??

01:07:21.846 --> 01:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
You're a great son.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I saw your soul.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.470 align:middle line:90%


01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I hang out with my family,

And you're one of them.

You're one of them.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So you don't see that.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
with what you know on
all these other planes.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You literally die into service.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You die into the
plane of reality

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
when you see that a starving
person, or a dying person,

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:49.109 align:middle line:84%
or a hungry person, or a
frightened person is you.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
You die in your separateness.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.649 align:middle line:84%
The whole trip of what's
good for me, what do I want,

01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:08.729 align:middle line:84%
what do I need, what do I want,
just becomes less interesting.

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:12.899 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
that's where the power is.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:18.010 align:middle line:84%
That's where the power is
that changes the universe.

When you can make
yourself into zero,

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:24.680 align:middle line:90%
then your power is unbelievable.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.252 align:middle line:84%
You are an irresistible
force, where there is no high

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:32.085 align:middle line:84%
and there is no low and
there's no judgments

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%

no good and there's no bad,

as one of the
greatest mysteries,

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and as the moment of
incredible transformation

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
imbues this moment with added
richness and energy that

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.765 align:middle line:90%
otherwise is used up in denial.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
make peace with death,

01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to see it as the culminating
adventure of this adventure

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.220 align:middle line:90%
called life.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.287 align:middle line:90%
It is not an error.

in the mystical literature.

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage you to explore
and find in your being

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that part of you that is
on those other channels.

loss, but rather the adventure.

Because from where I'm sitting,
life on this plane of reality,

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
because I live in the world
of reincarnation, of karma,

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
life on this plane is like
being in the fourth grade.

you had certain work

01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to do that involved
the suffering you do,

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of situations
you found yourself in,

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.540 align:middle line:90%
this is your curriculum.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not an error.

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%

your neuroses and your problem,

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting in
just the right place.

of saying if only, if only I

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.190 align:middle line:90%
could be--

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.578 align:middle line:84%
no, this is it,
including the if only.

01:13:11.578 --> 01:13:13.920 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And then at the time you
graduate, and somebody

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.635 align:middle line:90%
says, oh, but he died so young.

fourth grade early,

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
big deal, wonderful.

I've got one delicious sign,
I tell this every lecture,

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's such
a delicious image.

01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It's at a time when everybody
that came into my audience

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
is always the same age, and
they all dressed a certain way.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They all wore white and
had smiles and had flowers

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and were you know, they were--

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:50.920 align:middle line:90%
we love everybody.

01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
This one night, they were all
there smiling, and I was--

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I assumed everybody
had had acid.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And we were all just--

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.353 align:middle line:84%
I was talking far
out talk, you know?

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
woman sitting down

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.240 align:middle line:90%
in the front who was about 70.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And she had a hat
on with oranges

01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and cherries and things.

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And she had a black patent
leather bag and a print dress

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and responsible oxfords.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.633 align:middle line:90%
I think I conveyed the type.

01:18:25.633 --> 01:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting
there, and I'd

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.217 align:middle line:90%
say these outrageous things.

01:18:28.217 --> 01:18:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And she'd go like this, you see?

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd think, how does
she know, you know?

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
This is not an acid head.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.378 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just kept--

01:18:37.378 --> 01:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and I kept looking at her, and
I'd say more outrageous things

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and look, and she'd go
like this, you know?

01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:48.683 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the lecture,
I kind of smiled her up.

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
She came up and she
said, oh, thank you.

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:52.960 align:middle line:10%
She said, everything you
said just made perfect sense,

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and it was just so clear.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And I said, how do
you know all that?

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.150 align:middle line:10%
What do you do that gets
you into the position

01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:03.190 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness that
you know all this?

01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:06.140 align:middle line:10%
She leaned forth very
conspiratorially and she said,

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:06.940 align:middle line:10%
