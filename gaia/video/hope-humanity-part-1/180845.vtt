[BABY CRYING]

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.040 align:middle line:90%
You'll probably get a handful.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Honey, come hold her.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.860 align:middle line:90%
She's got blue eyes like--

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> With over 6.5
billion people on Earth,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
we've arrived at
the event horizon.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:90%
We must change.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
We cannot continue
on the same path.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
We're nearing ecological
collapse because

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
of misuse of our resources--

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
disease outbreaks, global
warming, fossil fuel shortages,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
war, famine, weather-related
disasters, heart disease,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
suicide, economic
collapse, and what

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
could possibly be the worst
of all water shortages.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
What will it take to
solve these problems?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the answer?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And where do these
answers come from?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history,
knowledge explosions

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
have occurred that are
so powerful that they

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:90%
revolutionized the human race.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
How do we explain a
sudden burst in evolution

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
for primitive human beings
that, some 100,000 years ago,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
suddenly became knowledgeable
in architecture, math,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and astronomy.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:10%
These knowledge explosions or
great information infusions

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:10%
have occurred at every
great epoch in civilization,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:10%
seemingly just in time to
prevent major disaster,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:10%
from ancient astronomy to
religion, law, stone masonry,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:10%
the Renaissance art explosion,
from the birth of ocean

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:10%
going vessels to the harnessing
of electricity, the light bulb,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:10%
record player, film,
TV, the atomic bomb,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:10%
and to the automobile and
airplane, space flight,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle line:10%
computers, and the internet.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:90%
There's one thing for certain.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge explosions
are occurring

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
at an exponential rate.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
In the past 100 years,
we've seen more of them

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:90%
than any other time in history.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
What we choose to do
with this knowledge

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
can either destroy
us or enlighten us.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Who will usher in the
next wave of knowledge

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that can save humanity?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:10%
Is there hope for humanity?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And if so, where will it come
from, and will it come in time?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We copy you down, Eagle.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Houston, uh.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:90%
The Eagle has landed.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Roger, tranq-- tranquility.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.684 align:middle line:90%
We copy you on the ground.

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got a bunch of
guys about to turn blue.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.516 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing again.

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA put men on
the moon in the 1960s.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But we have yet to discover
any other planets in the galaxy

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
that could sustain human life.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Earth, the most precious
jewel in the known universe--

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
are we willing to risk
losing our only home?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.923 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one
small step for man,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
one giant leap for mankind.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> With the imminent
ecological collapse we face,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Earth will survive,
but will humanity?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
This may be our last chance
to overcome the challenges

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:90%
that we face.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Gifted children are
being born everyday.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And it takes just
a handful of genius

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to revolutionize the world.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
If we know how to nurture
these gifted children,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
there just might be hope.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so important
how we shape

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
our children's consciousness,
how we include their mysticism

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and their ability to see auras
and communicate with beings

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:90%
from beyond this world.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
In a society where
we reject all that

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and we just cram them into
this narrow field of focus,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
or we say you can't
include spiritual visions,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't include things
outside of religion,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing
is, we're basically

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
saying to the universe that we
want everything to be exactly

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:90%
as it is right now.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:10%
We want to re-educate
our children

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:10%
the same way we were educated.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:10%
And the problem with a narrow
field of focus of reeducation

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:10%
is, we're going to get the
same world that we have now.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And the world now isn't working.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, if we haven't
smelled the coffee

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and really woken up and realized
what's going on in the world,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:90%
it's not working.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:90%
The economy is collapsing.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We are destroying the
planet and the environment.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We're outdoing our resources.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We have oceans of trash.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can't keep
going on like this.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to
create a new child,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
a new world, the emphasis
on children is everything.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this little thing
that we should pay attention.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the children,
we should love them.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:10%
No, this is everything.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:10%
Because they are everything.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:10%
They're going to be us.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:10%
They're going to be
sitting in our shoes next.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not new and
they're not thinking a new way

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
feeling a new way,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the world is going to be
the same way it is now.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.315 align:middle line:84%
And if it's the same way
it is now, we're finished.

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all over.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>> One thing's for certain.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
If we continue on the same
path that we're on now,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
we're heading towards
a giant black hole.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look,
from the economy

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to ecology to war to famine
to misusing our resources,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
all of it is just a locomotive
heading towards a black hole.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:10%
And something radical
has to happen.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like, can anybody
just put on the brakes

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and say, let's turn
right or turn left?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:90%
We can't go straight anymore.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:90%
We just have to say, stop.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:90%
This isn't working anymore.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change
our direction.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, humanity is finished.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Our greatest resource to
save humanity is the power

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
of imagination, creativity,
insight, vision,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and invention in our
evolution of consciousness.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Our children are
the next generation

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:90%
of potential global genius.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The revolution their
minds are capable of

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
can solve all of
the world's problems

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
if we can learn to
listen to ideas that are

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond our current limitations.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like the
hundredth monkey here.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm seeing
now is a major influx

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:10%
of these kids that are coming
into this world that are just

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:10%
beyond genius.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:10%
They're binary genius.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:10%
But they're also these kids
that just are totally aware.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.362 align:middle line:90%
You can see it in their eyes.

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I've seen many of them.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You'll see them in
a grocery store,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
or a mother carrying her baby
through the grocery store,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.544 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
looking at everything.

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes are huge, very
crystal clear, and very,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:84%
very much aware of what's
going on in their surroundings.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:10%
So these kids, I
think, are going

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:10%
to be part of what you
call the knowledge bomb.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:10%
We're in the information
age, but in a different way,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.615 align:middle line:10%
even more so, I think,
with these kids that

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:10%
are coming into this world.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.906 align:middle line:10%
So what's going to happen
when these children become

00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:10%
our teachers, leaders, and
they become the kids who are

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:10%
going to be shaping our future?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Well it just takes one
person to change the world--

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:10%
one idea--

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:10%
from Benjamin Franklin's
discovery of electricity,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:10%
to Nikola Tesla's discovery
of alternating current,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:10%
to Thomas Edison's discovery
of, actually, the light bulb.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.295 align:middle line:10%
And Edison discovers
the motion picture.

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:10%
It totally changed
everything for everybody.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:10%
Vladimir Zworykin
discovers television.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:10%
It's just one person, one
invention, changes everything.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But you look at
what we've invented.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.169 align:middle line:84%
You look at the rate of
knowledge explosions,

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
from the Stone Age, to the
Bronze Age and the Iron Age,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.842 align:middle line:84%
and then through the
Renaissance, which is amazing.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
Renaissance period.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the beginning of
being able to take vision--

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
things and that we
create in our minds--

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and put them on canvas, put them
in these beautiful paintings.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci is
this great inventor

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
who gives this this
three dimensional

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
kind of perspective of literally
helicopters and the birth

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of flight.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it might
have been da Vinci

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
who inspired the Wright brothers
to give birth to flight.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:90%
So we see what art did.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Art gave us the ability to see
infinite possibilities that

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
don't exist yet in
our civilization.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If we force our children
to fit into old educational

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
models, we are going to see
a repetition of old ideas.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Our current and future
situations will not evolve.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
To the ancient Maya, the Hopi,
and many other ancient mystic

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
traditions, 2012 marks
the end of the fourth sun,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of the
new, emerging fifth son.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The new sun will bring
change in the form

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
of natural disasters,
purification

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth and its species.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
finding it will also

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
bring in new light
activation at the DNA level.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have discovered
that by introducing

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
artificial weak magnetic fields
to fish before they reproduce,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
they can see profound genotype
transformations at the DNA

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
level, and even noticeable
phenotype changes

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
at the visible level, by
studying their new offspring.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This proves that energy
fields can alter living DNA.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
What if energy from
the new fifth sun

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:90%
causes a revolution in our DNA?

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Might we find our new
generation of children

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
being born with more
genius potential and more

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:90%
powers of human consciousness?

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Could the human evolution
still be occurring?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Could sudden unexplained
leaps in evolution

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
in our ancient past be
explained by sudden bursts

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic radiation striking
our planet from beyond Earth?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Could this help explain the
missing 100,000-year leap

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:90%
in evolution?

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, new children are
being born on our planet

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
with remarkable abilities
at a very young age.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Could the transformation
have already begun?

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When my wife Crystal and
I made our clear intention

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to have a child, within
months, one night,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I woke up and saw an infant
floating right above her head

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and looking down
into her closed eyes.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I believed our future
child was projecting

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%
a dream into her mind.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The same night that I didn't
realize David had seen a baby

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:10%
above me in lotus position, I
was dreaming of an East Indian

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:10%
man who came to me urgently,
telling me that I mustn't wait

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:10%
a year or more to get pregnant,
and that this child was very

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:10%
special, and that they had
all come to see the child.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I looked behind him and
saw about 10 East Indian

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
men looking down on me over an
outdoor railing of some hotel.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was a strange dream,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but that, obviously, the soul of
our baby had already chosen us.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And even though he had
said not to wait a year,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it was some time before
we actually conceived.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was a year
and a half, actually.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't sure if it was going
to be the same soul at all.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And later, when our baby
Alira was actually born,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:90%
that day, we had confirmation.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that the amount
of conscious souls out there

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
come to our planet

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes that we
haven't been able to make

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:90%
so far are numerous.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And they need conscious parents.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, there's
not enough conscious parents

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
who are willing to bring in
these babies and these children

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
into our next generation
that will ultimately bring us

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
the hope that we need.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So we really need
parents who are spiritual

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious and aware
and have great integrity

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and morals to really
come forward and be

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
willing to bring in
the number of souls

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
out there who really want to
come in and make a difference.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized that it
was just a matter of time

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
before we conceived,
that we were going to,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get some assistance.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I do have a
physical condition.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was concerned that there
may be some issues there.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So one night I
prayed to the angels.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that there are
angels around us all the time

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and willing to
help us if we ask,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
especially our own
personal guides.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that night,
I prayed deeply

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that they look at my
womb and make sure

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that everything's all
right, and, if not,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
take measures to
help me out there.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And I never told
David what I was Doing

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> To my surprise, Crystal
didn't tell me what she was

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
doing that night
she went to bed.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And my whole life,
I've been meditating

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:90%
every single day for 31 years.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.417 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the night, it's

00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
like, are there
cars in the room?

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:90%
It's so bright.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I opened my eyes.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's three of the
most beautiful angels--

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the first angels I've ever
seen with these eyes open--

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional,
gorgeous, blue lighting.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have feathers.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
They were bands of light
coming off of the shoulders,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
fluttering really fast,
with blue and white light.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And when they turned their heads
right towards me to look at me,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:84%
hovering right above
my wife's body,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
it was like pipe hands,
the back of the head.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.226 align:middle line:84%
The halos were so bright,
it was like a full moon.

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And they just looked at me.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, my god.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
There's angels above
my wife's body.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And they spun in this vortex and
went inside of her belly button

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and disappeared
inside of her body.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like they shrunk
to the size of a pearl.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the lights
moving around in her womb,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
like they were
checking out her womb.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, they
spun out of her third eye,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%
and they all just looked at me.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, my god,
I'm really seeing this.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Why are there angels
coming to prepare

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:90%
for the birth of our child?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, why our child?

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have angels?

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is it that every
time we pray and we

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:84%
ask for angelic assistance,
they really do show up,

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.271 align:middle line:84%
but not everybody
sees them, like I do.

00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Or possibly, is our child
a spiritual incarnation

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that beckoned these angels to
come for the importance of who

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:90%
this child is?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.541 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the answer
to these questions.

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But days later, the
angels came back again.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And this time, one
of them flew right up

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:90%
to my face, this close.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking inside of it.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
These angels were
the size of a baby--

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.549 align:middle line:84%
like a little baby,
about this big.

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And the little
angel's looking at me.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's all blue light.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The skull and the head is
glowing with blue light.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
The most beautiful little
face and little eyes.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
through the skin.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I can see this bright
light in the core of the brain.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's just looking at me.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now, over a
year and a half later, when

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
our daughter Alira
was born, I thought,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
what if that was Alira,
the blue star little baby

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
girl who came to
visit me, and she was

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:90%
one of these angelic beings?

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so amazed that my
wife called upon her angels

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and they showed up,
and this preparation.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
There's just nothing that
compares to this experience.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't as easy as I thought.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would just
have to make love just once,

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
it would happen.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
time that passed--

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
a couple of months or more
that happened, that it

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:90%
took to actually conceive.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
just kind of gave up

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
with that intensity of trying,
and saying, OK, did it happen,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:90%
did it happen?

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And some time had passed.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:10%
And we weren't really even
thinking about it anymore.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying,
our daughter knows

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:90%
when she wants to be born.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:90%
She knows.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
She knows when she's
going to come in here.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Our daughter, our son--

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
we really didn't
know for certain

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.380 align:middle line:90%
what we were going to have.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And during a deep
breathing meditation

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
one day, very clearly
in my third eye,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Ganesha, the remover
of obstacles,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
appeared in my third
eye, in this kind

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:90%
of very soft yellow light.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.881 align:middle line:84%
And he said, congratulations
on your new baby.

00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, my god.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Are we pregnant?

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Am I just imagining
this in my third eye?

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We immediately went
to the drugstore

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and got a pregnancy test,
and crystal took the test,

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:90%
and we were pregnant.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I was really concerned,
because a lot of people were

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:90%
saying, twins, twins.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where they
were getting this from.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was concerned.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in Arizona,
there's issues

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
with having a midwife
deliver twins.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I really needed
to know, because I

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%
was picking a midwife.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So I prayed to Jesus that night
to please give me a clear sign,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:90%
audibly--

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
because I don't really
see things visually.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm more audible--
and to let me know.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And just about 30
minutes into my sleep,

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I heard a voice very
clearly say, wipe the boy.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So it obviously meant, wipe
the boy out of the picture.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Because we had a Girl

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> About five and a
half-- possibly six,

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
seven months into
our pregnancy--

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wrote this stuff down--

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I woke up again
in our new house.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
We had moved.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And there was a bright
light in my eyes again.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And these experiences are rare.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
These things don't
happen every other night

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:90%
or every week or every month.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I open my eyes, and I see
this little girl, so beautiful,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and the brightest aura
shining around her.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.561 align:middle line:90%
And she's smiling.

00:18:57.561 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And she's looking at me.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And she looks quite
a bit like Crystal,

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
like when she was a little girl.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Probably a two or
three-year-old girl.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
she's so happy.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:90%
She's smiling at me.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Is this going to be my daughter?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to be
my future daughter?

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up and I
told my wife Crystal,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
there was this beautiful girl
that appeared in the brightest

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:90%
light next to our bed.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was
a light so bright

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that, since 1994,
I have probably

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
seen over 150 spirits with my
eyes open, really seeing them,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
full, three-dimensionally.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Of all the ghosts I've seen
and all the spirits I've seen,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
this would be the brightest aura
on any of them I've ever seen.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.984 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Crystal, there
was a little girl by our bed.

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to have a girl?

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Was that her?

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.125 align:middle line:90%
And Crystal said, well, maybe.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We thought, are we
going to have a boy?

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.916 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to have a girl?

00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get ultrasound.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, if
we're going to have a boy,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
then it must be our
next child, Alira,

00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
who's going to come next.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:90%
And she's visiting.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Right away, she wants to let
us know that she's coming.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And the day that
our daughter was

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
born, after an excruciating
42 hours of labor

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:90%
with no painkillers.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I was crying and having
emotional breakdowns.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I was so afraid she was
going to die in the labor.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I was so afraid that I was
going to lose everything

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't even
believe that a person

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
can go through that much just
to give birth to a human being.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And when our daughter came
out, I just burst into tears.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a girl.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I realized it was
the little girl who

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:90%
appeared beside our bed.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And it made me really think,
we choose our future children

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
as much as they choose us.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
They really are choosing us.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And they really do try
to somehow contact us

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:90%
before they're born.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I think many of
us don't see that,

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe don't experience it.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:90%
But it really is happening.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That relationship is
established before birth.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And possibly, our children
are reincarnated, not even

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
necessarily from Earth.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they're from
another star system.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was a question that
I asked through my meditation

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Is our daughter from
another star system?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Is she a star being?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:10%
And I got a very, very
clear answer in a dream

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:10%
that our daughter was from a
legendary blue star system.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:10%
And I even got the
identity of the exact star

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:10%
in the constellation.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's Merope.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is from the
star system of Merope.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The children of the new
sun are being born with new

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
abilities, creativity, and
spiritual visions that we are

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
not prepared to deal with.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we can do is
help parents become more aware.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Pablo is a 14-year-old
boy from Peoria, Arizona.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:84%
He's appeared on ABC's "20/20"
and numerous other shows

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to talk about his
experiences of seeing

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings,
angels, and ghosts,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and the messages he receives
from beyond this world.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw spirits when I
was at my toddler age.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:10%
I saw them, but I was
little, so I didn't really

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:10%
realize if they were real
people or just spirits.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
once I met Shannon,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was
able to speak to them

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.597 align:middle line:90%
and communicate with them.

00:22:46.597 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What did they tell you?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Did they have any messages?

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they told me
some information about

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions and
Heaven and all that.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctors told him that he
suffers from hallucinations

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
or schizophrenia, and
put him on medications.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But none of the medicines
stopped his spiritual visions.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:90%
They kept on happening.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Children are being born
with spiritual abilities,

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and we are just drugging
them, because we

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that
it is a gift to be

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:90%
able to talk to the other side.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
What if the universe is
giving us an opportunity,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.114 align:middle line:90%
and we are turning a blind eye?

00:23:32.114 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> When we have kids
that come in, like Pablo,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:10%
that are able to
see and hear things,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:10%
it's based on the person's
perspective in their own life

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:10%
as to how they interpret
that information.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:10%
If we have someone that's
got a pretty closed mind

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't know a
lot about spirits

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:10%
or things of that
nature, then, of course,

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:10%
they're going to be diagnosed
as possibly schizophrenic

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:10%
or anything like
that, where they're

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:10%
hallucinating or delusional.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
know any different.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
based on the person

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that's giving the diagnosis
and what they're educated in

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.095 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
knowledgeable about.

00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the bottom line?

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.234 align:middle line:90%
What do these kids bring?

00:24:09.234 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:10%
I guess many people could give
you many different answers.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:10%
Mine is quite simple.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:10%
Salvation.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.702 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:18.014 align:middle line:90%
>> You can call it evolution.

00:24:18.014 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Call it what you want.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But these kids coming in with
the answers, they're here.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There are much easier ways to do
things than we've been doing it

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
They come in with
the answer to us,

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to move us to the next level
of consciousness and awareness,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and to do it
lovingly and gently,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
if we just open our hearts.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.939 align:middle line:10%
>> In the cases of the art and
the music and the prodigies,

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:10%
they're either bringing
it in from the past life,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.896 align:middle line:10%
or they're channeling.

00:24:44.896 --> 00:24:46.740 align:middle line:10%
In the case of a
schizophrenic, I

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:10%
think we're dealing with a
super visual psychic who's

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:10%
able to actually see the
fields of consciousness.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, they're right
here in this room right now.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.509 align:middle line:84%
But you and I
might not see them.

00:24:57.509 --> 00:24:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we bring a certain
kind of person in here,

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.925 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
see, well, there

00:25:00.925 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
could be 20 people standing in
this room that are currently

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:90%
unavailable to us, visually.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But to someone else,
there as clear as day.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:10%
>> In regard to the
individuals that I work with,

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:10%
there are many instances.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:10%
We have a unit that
has so many women

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:10%
that we work with in
a clinical setting.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's an in-house
rehabilitation facility.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's behaviors
like that all the time.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most addicts seem
to be very fairly highly

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, meaning that
they may hear voices.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:84%
They may make things
happen without knowing

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:90%
how they did so.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of these
feelings or this behavior,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they get into
drugs and drinking,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:84%
because they do not understand
why it's happening to them.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
the alcohol and drugs,

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
the medication dumbs
that creativity down.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it makes them
feel more comfortable.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But in the same
sense, they probably

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
could become more
comfortable without the drugs

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
with their ability if they
understood what it was about.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So probably, I would say,
over 50% of the individuals

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that I work with
demonstrate, or have asked,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
or have expressed
that they hear voices,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:84%
or see things, or
understand things in ways--

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe what
the average person believes

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:90%
about the unseen, the unknown.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And they feel-- but they
can't express it in a safe way

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
without being judged
or given medication.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you tell the
doctor certain things,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you may be labeled
as crazy, even

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:90%
though they're real to you.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a problem
of expression as well.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So I can't express how I
feel, but I also can't--

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:10.642 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why I
feel here and see this way.

00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Mark Patterson.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I am the founder of the
Conscious Children's Network.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm also a sound healer.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I had a profound near-death
experience at the age of 16.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I was very intuitive as a child.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
growing up in Iowa,

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:10%
I was always told you don't
talk about those things.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:10%
How should you know that?

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.246 align:middle line:10%
You don't know that.

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:10%
And my favorite was from
my father, who said,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:10%
you must be possessed.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.392 align:middle line:10%
And now as a presenter
and a speaker,

00:27:34.392 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:10%
I get emails from
parents, from all

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:10%
over the world, who don't
understand why their child is

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:10%
talking to their
grandparent who's deceased,

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:10%
or remember past lives, or
memories from past lives.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:10%
And they feel overwhelmed.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:90%
They have nowhere to turn.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I created this
conference, because as a child,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt very sensitive,
very awkward.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Why was I seeing
lights around people?

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Why was I talking to angels?

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.990 align:middle line:90%
And why were no one else?

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we created
this conference

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.524 align:middle line:84%
to give parents tools
and resources for them.

00:28:03.524 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we're going to do

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to have a
discussion panel with children

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.442 align:middle line:84%
who talk about previous
memories of past lives.

00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:10%
And example of that would be
would be the best selling book

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:10%
called "Soul Stories," about
the young boy who remembered

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.216 align:middle line:10%
being a World War II pilot.

00:28:18.216 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have children
talk about their angels.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have activities
where they build energy balls,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:90%
work with healing light.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's to support families
that have intuitive children,

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:90%
so that they feel supported.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We want to validate psychic
kids and not medicate them.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Far too many of these children
feel overly sensitive.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:90%
They turn to drugs and alcohol.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We have an unprecedented
teenage suicide rate in America

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
right now, all over the world.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:10%
We have children that
are manifesting things,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:10%
that are levitating, that are
doing all kinds of what I think

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.322 align:middle line:10%
is normal, or how we
should be, yet parents

00:28:54.322 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:10%
seem to be terrified of them.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
that they want to do

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:90%
is place them on medication.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So we are providing the
tools, education, resources

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
for parents to validate
children's psychic gifts

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and not medicate them.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> A growing number of
psychologists and psychiatrists

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
believe many children and
adults are misdiagnosed as being

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenic because they
can see and hear messages from

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:90%
beyond this world.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Many also believe this is a
gift that we are mistakenly

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:90%
not exploring properly.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.050 align:middle line:84%
What if these visions
could open a dialogue that

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:90%
could save humanity?

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I consider a schizophrenia
condition to be more of some

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.870 align:middle line:10%
kind of a super psychic,
a super psychic gift,

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:10%
where the vibrational
of frequencies,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:10%
of things that may be
functioning at a higher

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:10%
or slightly lower frequency than
the third dimensional reality

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:10%
that we're currently occupying,
these people are actually able

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:10%
to perceive the things
that you and I are not.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go to
a metaphysical store

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:84%
anywhere across
the United States,

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.961 align:middle line:84%
and certain people
can see your aura.

00:30:02.961 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
They can tell you, oh,
your aura's purple.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Or the Indigo children,
they're the ones

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:84%
who were the ones
who'd identified

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
these special children
as actually having

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
a special hue around
them that is actually

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
a different color
than the rest of us.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And that makes
perfect sense to me.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, all of these people,
no matter what kind of a label

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
you want to put on them,
they've got something different

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:90%
that the rest of us don't have.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And instead of throwing
them in institutions,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.340 align:middle line:84%
medicating them until
they can't think,

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we need to be the ones
who step up to the plate

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and start figuring out how we're
going to embrace their gifts

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.295 align:middle line:84%
and realize that these
people, in my mind,

00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
are prophets who are coming
here to bring us maybe

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
the key to creating the
whole saving of planet

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Earth that, you know, God
knows we need right now.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:10%
>> When children come
of educational age,

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.590 align:middle line:10%
we begin to want to constrain
their awareness so that they

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:10%
learn to think in linear
sequential chains.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:10%
It's like they pick up
this piece of information,

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.480 align:middle line:10%
this is what we
teach in our schools.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at this bit of
information, put it together

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:84%
with this next bit,
and then this next bit,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and this next bit, and
create a chain of logic,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:84%
so that you can come to
some kind of a ability

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to create some kind of a result.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And this model has worked
really well for centuries now.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, we've gotten to a
level where we've, in a sense,

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:90%
pretty much perfected it.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So much so that we've been
able to invent actually

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
much more holographic ways
of conveying information now,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in today's world, based on
that old linear sequential

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:90%
way of putting things together.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by this is
the modern computer games

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that young kids
are being taught.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
In order to get to the higher
levels of any computer game,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning,
at the first stages,

00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:00.090 align:middle line:84%
you can, with your awareness,
go from one point on the screen

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
to another point,
to another point,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and you can do your
best to figure out

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
how to manipulate
whatever you're

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.500 align:middle line:84%
using on the screen, your
cursor, and the characters

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:84%
you're manipulating,
in a sequence,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to create the result
that you're looking for.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But once you get to the
higher levels of modern games,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
there comes a point
where you have

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
to give up this linear
sequential sequencing

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
of information, and
you have to start

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to look at the whole screen
simultaneously instantaneously.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the
screen as a hologram

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and instantaneously, as though
you're in your flow zone,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.850 align:middle line:84%
as though you're in a
whole field of awareness,

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to suddenly
just instantaneously make

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.870 align:middle line:84%
decisions in order to
move through that level

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.347 align:middle line:90%
and get to the next level.

00:32:50.347 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's carry this a
little bit further.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Not only are modern
computer games doing

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
this, but the very creation
of the internet, the Google

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
ability to search information
instantaneously, in the moment,

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.070 align:middle line:84%
relative to something
you're interested in,

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
the new kind of iPhone, where
kids can text each other

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with each
other instantaneously

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.190 align:middle line:84%
within the context of them
having a feeling that they want

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to share something
with somebody,

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
they can do it
instantaneously in this sort

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%
of interconnected, infinitely
interconnected, field of now.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly in school,
with the background of children

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
coming to the school age,
six or seven years old,

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting into
first and second grade,

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, we're
asking them to slow

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:84%
their awareness and their
way of processing information

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
to a snail's pace,
when they've already

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
been learning how to
function at lightning light

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:90%
speed, super light speed.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we're asking them to
slow down, and constrain,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and start to look in this
linear sequential way again,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and so they get rebellious.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They say, I'm seeing
things in the moment

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're not even
aware of, my good teacher.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm way past you already in
what you're trying to teach me.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, the way
that you're trying

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
to constrain me
and constrict me,

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I find it antithetical
to what I really

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:90%
feel to be doing right now.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
get rebellious.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.020 align:middle line:84%
They start to get what we call
attention deficit disorder.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And what they're really
having is resistance

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to being constrained into
this linear sequential way

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of thinking when they already
know how to super logic.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
They already know
how to holograph.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that our school,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
our educational
systems, have not--

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:84%
most of our educational
systems don't

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:84%
have a clue about what's
happening at this quantum level

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:90%
of information processing.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:84%
And so there you have
all of these kids, who

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.050 align:middle line:84%
look like they have ADHD,
but really what they have

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.990 align:middle line:84%
is rebellion against
being constrained,

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
when they would rather jump
into something that they're

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
totally interested in, that
completely excites them

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:90%
and thrills them.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And would love to be
guided to learn information

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and how to in a sense put whole
fields of insight together,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
in relation to something
they're interested in,

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:90%
but nobody's teaching them that.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
They're all saying
what you gotta

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
do is you've got to
postpone gratification.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got to wait till
you're like 28, 22,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
before you can really
get interested in what

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:90%
you're interested in.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we want
you to learn in

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.060 align:middle line:84%
this linear sequential,
painstaking slow, snail's pace

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:90%
way what we want you to learn.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we're seeing increasing
rebellion like never before.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot to
do with the new kinds

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of holographic
communicative tools

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.872 align:middle line:84%
that we've invented over
the last 20, 30 years.

00:35:59.872 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now we have more
problems in the high school

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.080 align:middle line:84%
level and the college level
because these kids don't like

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
what we're cramming
down their throats.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't fit into the box.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.350 align:middle line:90%
They want to go somewhere else.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they just want
to sit around and be stupid.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.627 align:middle line:84%
They have attention
deficit disorder

00:36:15.627 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because they don't like
what they're being taught.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If there is such a thing
as attention deficit disorder.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Who created that label?

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatry and the
psychiatry industry

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:84%
has created more
labels for these kids,

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, ADD, and ADHD, and
schizophrenia, and bipolar.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But along with
every disease, there

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a whole
barrage of designer drugs.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And I call them designer
drugs because they

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.546 align:middle line:90%
have these funny names.

00:36:39.546 --> 00:36:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they dream these up.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
But it almost becomes a fashion.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real sad thing.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
If they're dumbing
these children down

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.305 align:middle line:84%
with meds at any age, these
kids aren't going to excel.

00:36:51.305 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
sitting there drool

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.054 align:middle line:90%
coming out of their mouths.

00:36:54.054 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
a problem in many cases.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.322 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, these kids
are looking out the window

00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:02.530 align:middle line:90%
because they're the dreamers.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%
They are the creators.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
They are creating
that time to think,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:90%
like you mentioned earlier.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, ADD, there's actually
studies that have been done,

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:84%
when kids actually drift and
they space out, later in life--

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, I could have been ADD.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:90%
I did terribly in grade school.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking
out the window.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I was imagining.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>> The dreams.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a dreamer.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.004 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] personality.

00:37:23.004 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Now if you have these,
and just let the children be,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and let them be the creative
beings that they are,

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:84%
if their parents understand
this and learn to support that,

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
either homeschooling them or
pulling them out of mainstream

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.300 align:middle line:84%
schools, because in my opinion
the mainstream schools is

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
partly what's messing these
children up in the first place.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The subjects that a lot of
these children are being taught,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
the kids could care less
about, but they're being

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.880 align:middle line:90%
told they have to learn it.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So the gifted children
that I have interviewed

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and like Akiane and
Pablo, these kids

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:84%
come into this
world ready to run.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:90%
They have ideas.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:90%
They already have their mission.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.850 align:middle line:84%
If they're kept in a box, not
able to think outside of it

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.046 align:middle line:84%
because they're kept in some
mainstream school, or worse

00:38:04.046 --> 00:38:05.670 align:middle line:84%
yet, being drugged
down because they're

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.235 align:middle line:84%
being labeled with
some so-called disease,

00:38:08.235 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that's a big
problem for society.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's look at
a kid like Pablo.

00:38:11.026 --> 00:38:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Pablo is saying that he has
dialogues with invisible higher

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:90%
intelligences.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:84%
He's not suffering from what
appears to be schizophrenia.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's not getting
into convulsions,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and freaking out, and
throwing tantrums.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:90%
He seems very, very stable.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.539 align:middle line:10%
But we look at the idea--

00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:10%
let's go back, because
one of the things we

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:10%
removed from our
culture in Europe

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:10%
and also in the West, Canada
and Mexico, is the shaman.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a natural
selection process

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
in most ancient cultures that
somebody had a natural tendency

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to have contact with
the spirit world.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And that contact
was not considered

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to be a problem, where you
said, oh, this person has

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenia, we're
going to lock them up.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You actually used that as
a tool to create a dialogue

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.040 align:middle line:84%
with higher intelligences
in the universe

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:90%
to possibly solve problems.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the
Dalai Lama today,

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
as advanced as he
is spiritually,

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:90%
has his own oracle.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama has
his own oracle.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was in
India with the Dalai Lama,

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
the oracle was getting messages
that the most important thing

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that humans can do now is
solve the problem of polluting

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
the environment,
and global warming,

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:90%
and that the ecology crisis.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:90%
That was the big message.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't really
need an oracle to do that.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:10%
But what if you
could use an oracle

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:10%
or use the shaman
in your culture

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:10%
to have creative
dialogues to discover

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:10%
the solutions, the
actual technologies that

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.810 align:middle line:10%
would solve the problems
in the environment?

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we lost.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we've said,
well, we don't use shamans.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we have our
religions and our churches,

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.500 align:middle line:84%
but there is no
new impetus there.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You have teachings that are
2,000 years old or older,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and you say, that's all we have.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So if we want an answer from
God how to solve a problem,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.220 align:middle line:84%
well it's not allowed
in the church.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So where are we
going to let it in?

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think kids like Pablo are
good examples of children that

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:90%
need to be taken seriously.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because what if you can have
any question answered by higher

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.010 align:middle line:90%
intelligences in the universe?

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have all
the answers down here.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty darn obvious we
don't have all the answers.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We need to ask
somebody out there who

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:90%
really knows what's going on.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And that little boy
might be the conduit.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.459 align:middle line:84%
He might be the one who
creates the dialogue

00:40:30.459 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and gets the answers
the changes the world.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying, that's not
important in our culture.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, and wait until
these children get to be

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.230 align:middle line:84%
in their teens and in their
20s, and they're going to be

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:84%
the movers and the
shakers on this planet.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They'll be our new
teachers, our leaders,

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:90%
hopefully a president one day.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds
of thousands

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of these children and young
adults, that are here right

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
now, that are here
ready to make a change.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they are actually
making a change right now,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.282 align:middle line:90%
as we speak.

00:40:58.282 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>> A gifted child is a child
that comes into this planet

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:10%
with extraordinary talents
and abilities way beyond

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:10%
their years.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:10%
Many of them are
incredibly sensitive.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:10%
Many of them are psychic.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases,
these children

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
are coming in because we need
hope on this planet right now.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.550 align:middle line:90%
We need inspiration.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:90%
We need upliftment.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:10%
These children show
us the potential

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.910 align:middle line:10%
that we have within ourselves.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:10%
For example, if a
gifted child can

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:10%
paint an extraordinary
painting or heal someone,

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.600 align:middle line:10%
why can't we get
started on the projects

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:10%
that we have in our hearts?

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They're here to help us
see who we can become.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> If I am demonstrating
different behaviors than

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:10%
the norm, I, as an example,
may cause you to critically

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:10%
evaluate what you've
been taught to be true.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Now if I'm born, and
I'm five years old,

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and I have this exceptional
gift of creativity,

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
it also may cause me
to critically evaluate

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.030 align:middle line:84%
what I understand about
the unseen and the unknown.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Is there really past lives?

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, where does
this talent come from?

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so as the critical
thinking occurs within me,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I begin to change my mind
about what reality is about.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And I seek new answers.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like there's a
lot of evidence now that more

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and more children are coming,
are appearing on the planet

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:84%
with advanced abilities,
advanced psychic abilities,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:84%
advanced spiritual abilities,
advanced ability to tap

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.050 align:middle line:84%
into wisdom and knowledge
that we have not seen much

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I get the feeling from looking
at the various trends underway

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:10%
that on the spirit dimension,
on the dimension of those who

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.780 align:middle line:10%
are not in the
physical body yet,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of
support for trying

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:10%
to help us get through
these difficult times,

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:10%
to help resolve some of the
conflicts and the tensions

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.250 align:middle line:10%
that were facing.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we really are in a
time of crisis, after all.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:84%
There's no question that
our Earth's environment

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:90%
is in big trouble.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We are destroying species
at a very fast rate.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
bleaching of the corals.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.430 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
rising of the oceans.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We're even seeing
the possibility

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of huge shifts in the solar
and the geological formations

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:84%
if something happens
with the sunspot cycle

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.150 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of years.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So there a lot of
things going on that

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:84%
tell us that we're
in a time of crisis.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's oftentimes
the time when

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:84%
very wise guides
and teachers show up

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
as a way to help us through it.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.670 align:middle line:84%
That would not
surprise me at all.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at the
children of various types,

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.240 align:middle line:84%
the crystal children, and
the others, the Indigos,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.390 align:middle line:84%
all the ones that are showing
up with very advanced abilities,

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:84%
it leads me to believe
that maybe there is a plan.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is some trend
to bring these beings

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in to help us get
through this time,

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to teach us all to
meditate better,

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the wisdom that's
available to all of us,

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and to help do our part to
shift the vibrational frequency

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom of the planet.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's the optimistic view.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to lean
in that direction,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what will unfold
in the next couple of years.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Akiane is a self-taught
child prodigy modern artist.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.940 align:middle line:84%
She began drawing at the age
of four and painting at six.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.120 align:middle line:84%
She rises at 4 AM to
begin her journey,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:84%
working, drawing, painting,
writing aphorisms and poetry.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.055 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, my
parents and my whole family

00:44:48.055 --> 00:44:49.360 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe in God.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:10%
We were practically
like atheists.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.190 align:middle line:10%
God was not mentioned
in our house.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.870 align:middle line:10%
One day, I started having
these visions and dreams

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:10%
about heaven, galaxies,
different dimensions,

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:10%
the future, people
all over the world.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting to me.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And as a four-year-old,
this voice

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.150 align:middle line:84%
guided me through
these journeys.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I asked this
voice, who are you?

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Where are you taking me?

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
He says, don't worry,
don't be scared.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:90%
You know who I am already.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know at that
time, but day after day, he

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.390 align:middle line:84%
started taking me to
these different places.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just started calling
him God for some reason.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
I got that name.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But I just started
calling him God.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't tell
anybody, not even

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.110 align:middle line:84%
my parents, nor my
brothers, for months.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But I had to tell someone
after seven, eight months,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.230 align:middle line:84%
because they're always
crowding my memory,

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and they're just piling up.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And I told my mom about it.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And she was very, very
confused at first.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Hearing these weird visitations
for a four-year-old?

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while for
them to understand that I

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:90%
was having these visions.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to prove
it to them was by drawing.

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I started drawing
everything that I was seeing.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And little by
little, they started

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:90%
picking up those details.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And they started believing in
me, my brothers and my parents.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And they supported
me ever since.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so glad.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And I can never
stop thanking them.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I think my mom is
probably my inspiration.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.310 align:middle line:90%
She was always there for me.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And each time-- so many towns I
wanted to give up on painting,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:84%
on poetry, because it
was so hard for me,

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.970 align:middle line:90%
she told me just not to give up.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.520 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep moving forward.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to do this.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:90%
People need to see your work.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.190 align:middle line:90%
People need to see who you are.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe she is truly my
inspiration, my role model.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what kept me going
through all these years.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Akiane writes this in a poem
that she named herself Ocean

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.460 align:middle line:10%
before she was born.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.890 align:middle line:10%
Actually, she said that
she chose us as parents.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.220 align:middle line:10%
She saw her own conception
and development as a child.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.240 align:middle line:10%
And she said that she even had--

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.974 align:middle line:10%
she had chosen her
own name, Ocean.

00:47:24.974 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what came
first, the egg or the chicken,

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.250 align:middle line:90%
the bird.

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Did she?

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Did she?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Who volunteered for what?

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Did we read between
the lines there?

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As a four-year-old, I
didn't have any friends.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any
television, newspapers,

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.790 align:middle line:84%
none of the information
of the outside world.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was completely
normal that I was drawing.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I was having these
visions and dreams.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I thought everybody has this.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But when time went on, I started
catching these details that

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:middle line:90%
maybe they don't.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they still are maturing.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And a four-year-old,
it's very young

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.140 align:middle line:84%
to have these
visions and dreams.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I got older,
I more understood it.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, very
rarely I watch TV,

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and read magazines
and newspapers,

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but I understand
it perfectly now.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> She has made dozens of
TV and news appearances,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.420 align:middle line:84%
such as on "Oprah,"
"Good Morning America,"

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.390 align:middle line:84%
"World News with Peter
Jennings," "Time Magazine,"

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and many, many more.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Not only do her
original paintings

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.140 align:middle line:84%
sell for upwards and
beyond a million dollars,

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.930 align:middle line:84%
her ideas come from her
spiritual visions and messages

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.760 align:middle line:84%
she receives from heaven,
God, and the angels.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.240 align:middle line:84%
She claims she has actually
traveled beyond our world

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to meet with God and
to experience heaven,

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and thus paints from
her experiences.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I do have a
responsibility with me and God,

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:04.140 align:middle line:84%
the paintings that I paint,
the choices that I choose,

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:90%
just what I'm going to pick.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.640 align:middle line:90%
I do have an agreement with God.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I do have a strong relationship
between me and him.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.870 align:middle line:90%
But I do have--

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:19.720 align:middle line:90%
some days are very challenging.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
part of my process.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's part of my journey,
part of my mission.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But there are sometimes that
are very, very, very, very

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.980 align:middle line:90%
challenging.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.460 align:middle line:90%
But I just get it over with.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I just let go of everything,
breathe in, and just--

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.260 align:middle line:84%
it just all comes
together at the end.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Akiane's mom, Forelli,
tells the story of how Akiane

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
suddenly disappeared
for many hours,

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:84%
causing a pandemonium
in her neighborhood.

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Forelli started a relentless
search with local police

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.630 align:middle line:90%
for her missing child.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that really, out of
everything that has happened,

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.980 align:middle line:84%
out of the whole
spiritual transformation,

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:13.110 align:middle line:84%
probably the most interesting
two cases were when I asked

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.910 align:middle line:90%
her, where are you at?

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Where have you been?

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.620 align:middle line:90%
It seems like you're talking--

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:84%
more than a week or
two, it's not like--

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.450 align:middle line:90%
where have you been.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.490 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, you haven't
understood anything, mom,

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.040 align:middle line:90%
she says.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I am there right now,
and I'm seeing myself

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.460 align:middle line:90%
as I talk with you.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.450 align:middle line:84%
It took me eight years to
understand what she said,

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:44.190 align:middle line:84%
up until she painted the
"Footsteps of Eternity" about

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.014 align:middle line:90%
six months ago.

00:50:46.014 --> 00:50:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what she meant

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.470 align:middle line:84%
about those
different dimensions.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the first
times that she mentioned, when

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.970 align:middle line:90%
she was about four and five.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Another time was
when she disappeared.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:90%
We had police everywhere.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We had this-- half a day she's
gone, she's completely gone.

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely gone.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Every people, 100 police,
people, searching for her,

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:90%
stopping cars in this city.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Half a day went by while
Akiane remembered seeing

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.610 align:middle line:84%
everybody floating
right above the mall,

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
yet she was invisible to
everyone the whole time.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Where was she?

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Did she vibrate her atoms into
a higher physical dimension?

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And she reappeared
right in the midst of us.

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And then she says,
well, you know,

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:84%
it was a very
interesting moment.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like to talk about
it, because it was very, very

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.300 align:middle line:90%
bad for me.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It took me literally a year
to recover from that moment,

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
from that day.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But she comes up to me and says,
mom, you had experience this.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And she explained everything,
as if she had seen everything

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:00.364 align:middle line:84%
from above, what I was
doing, what dad was doing,

00:52:00.364 --> 00:52:02.780 align:middle line:84%
what brothers were doing, how
many police cars were there.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.600 align:middle line:84%
She knew exactly
what was going on.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know, we
don't discuss this scenario,

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because many people would
probably not believe it.

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.289 align:middle line:84%
That's why we don't
talk about this.

00:52:15.289 --> 00:52:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But those two scenarios
really showed me

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that there is
something out there

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.480 align:middle line:84%
different than just this
physical challenging

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.370 align:middle line:90%
life and suffering on Earth.

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Modern theories in physics
propose many invisible

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:84%
mathematical dimensions
to our physical universe,

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:84%
other than the known three
visible dimensions plus time.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
Akiane physically

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.960 align:middle line:84%
went into another
dimension while her mom had

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.020 align:middle line:90%
the police looking for her?

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What mysteries could we
learn from human beings

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.110 align:middle line:84%
who can jump from one
dimension into another?

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Might we find a
whole universe where

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we are no longer the only
ones alive in the universe,

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:03.290 align:middle line:84%
the solar system, and let
alone our very own planet?

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Might other beings be living
on Earth in a higher dimension?

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Is this where the Kingdom
of Heaven really is?

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could glimpse a higher
dimension of our own reality,

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:24.080 align:middle line:84%
would we discover whole
invisible civilizations right

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.490 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth?

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And even on nearby planets?

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Is the reason we cannot perceive
other life in the universe due

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that we use so
little of our brain's potential

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.300 align:middle line:90%
power?

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And he carried me
away in the spirit

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to a great and high mountain.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me that great
city, the holy Jerusalem,

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:90%
descending out of heaven.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In my first book,
"Synchronized Universe,"

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I talk about, in
the last chapter,

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.730 align:middle line:90%
the idea of parallel realities.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:84%
These actually
are very naturally

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:03.920 align:middle line:84%
predicted in the
model that I propose.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that at the very
smallest scale of particles,

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of what we would call matter,
electrons, protons, et cetera,

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.026 align:middle line:90%
they're not just sitting still.

00:54:13.026 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:90%
They're actually vibrating.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They're going in
tiny little orbits.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.820 align:middle line:84%
They're moving all the time
at the smallest scales.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And these orbits
determine what direction

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the particles are
moving and looking,

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.940 align:middle line:84%
what direction they are able
to send and receive energy

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:90%
at any moment.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.040 align:middle line:10%
So this leads to the idea
of a synchronized universe,

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.450 align:middle line:10%
namely that if the particles are
moving in just the right way,

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.470 align:middle line:10%
their directions
line up, so they

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:41.150 align:middle line:10%
can interact with each other.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.790 align:middle line:10%
And we say, I see
you, you see me,

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:45.290 align:middle line:10%
we're all part of
the same universe.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.910 align:middle line:90%
We exchange forces.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And that determines
one universe,

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
one which is synchronized,
where these motions

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.510 align:middle line:90%
are in sync with one another.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can have many other
realities or dimensions, where

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:90%
other particles are present.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Their motions are different.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Their synchronization, their
frequencies, their phases

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.740 align:middle line:90%
are a little bit different.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.710 align:middle line:84%
They won't line up at
just the right moment.

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.918 align:middle line:84%
They may line up at a
different moment, where they'll

00:55:11.918 --> 00:55:13.770 align:middle line:90%
see other sets of particles.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes possible to
have parallel realities, which

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.370 align:middle line:84%
are right in the same
space, but they don't really

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:24.540 align:middle line:84%
interact much with each other,
only in the sense of noise.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So this idea, which
comes out very naturally

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.365 align:middle line:84%
from the synchronized
universe model,

00:55:32.365 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:84%
appears as though
it may actually

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.730 align:middle line:84%
be getting some support in
modern physics discoveries.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:40.430 align:middle line:84%
In the last couple
of years, a physicist

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:44.210 align:middle line:84%
named Craig Hogan at
Family Lab has concluded,

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.020 align:middle line:84%
from looking at some gravity
experiments in Germany

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and from the Hubble
telescope imagery,

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that the universe, at
its fundamental nature,

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.360 align:middle line:90%
actually is holographic.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So we think of matter as being
nice, solid billiard balls.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And they can't
penetrate each other.

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
permanence about them.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But really, it looks more likely
that its holographic, which

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:84%
makes it very easy to teleport
someone to another place

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:84%
or to shift their phase,
so they're out of phase

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.110 align:middle line:84%
with the other
matter around them.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they pass right through
it and you won't see them.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.002 align:middle line:84%
They're still present,
but their vibrations

00:56:24.002 --> 00:56:26.210 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit different
frequency or a little bit

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:27.410 align:middle line:90%
different phase.

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the
basic idea to understand

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:90%
what happened to Akiane.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's also probably
the basic mechanism

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.630 align:middle line:84%
by which yogis, you know
the adepts in India,

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:43.250 align:middle line:84%
are able to disappear
or to bi-locate,

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.130 align:middle line:84%
where they'll be in two places
at once, or to teleport.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are plenty of
examples in the literature,

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.340 align:middle line:84%
if you read Yogananda's
wonderful autobiography.

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.810 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
growing up in India,

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.540 align:middle line:84%
becoming a yogi, and
some of the masters

00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that he met as a young boy,
who could do things like this.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is a model for how
such things are possible.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In June of 1999, a
15-year-old girl went missing

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.300 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean, off of the
coast of Pacific Palisades,

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.680 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Helicopters and search parties
combed the beaches and waters

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:16.910 align:middle line:90%
for hours.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Just after dark, the
search was called off

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:23.960 align:middle line:84%
because the girl was
nowhere to be seen.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Several hours
later, the girl was

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:30.290 align:middle line:84%
found in the exact same
spot where she went missing.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:10%
The 15-year-old
girl told lifeguards

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.500 align:middle line:10%
she was unconscious in the
waters for seven hours.

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.020 align:middle line:10%
The lifeguards were
astounded because that

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.650 align:middle line:10%
would be impossible.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:84%
How could a child
lay unconscious

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.320 align:middle line:84%
floating in a turbulent,
freezing cold ocean for seven

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.320 align:middle line:84%
hours, and then wash
ashore unharmed?

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Where was she?

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Was she physically taken
into another dimension

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.670 align:middle line:84%
where she seemingly
floated for seven hours

00:57:55.670 --> 00:58:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and then returned into
our dimension unharmed?

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2010, physicists from the
United Kingdom and Canada may

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.290 align:middle line:84%
have discovered the first actual
evidence that another universe

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.480 align:middle line:90%
actually exists.

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.780 align:middle line:84%
By measuring the even
distribution of the background

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.290 align:middle line:84%
temperature of the universe's
cosmic microwave background

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:23.280 align:middle line:84%
radiation, giant bubbles
of temperature increase

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.400 align:middle line:84%
appear where it seems
our universe got

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.190 align:middle line:84%
bumped by another
universe, leaving

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:33.420 align:middle line:84%
an observable
impression in the CMBR.

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:36.480 align:middle line:84%
This bumping would allow
for two or more universes

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.460 align:middle line:90%
to exchange information.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, this bumping
could happen anywhere inside

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:46.170 align:middle line:84%
of our universe on a
grand or very small scale.

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Could a single person get bumped
from one universe into another?

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Or are they jumping into another
dimension of our own universe?

00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The very first actually
drawing that I was drawing was

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:05.310 align:middle line:10%
of an angel that I was
seeing every single moment,

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.570 align:middle line:10%
every single second.

00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And she was always with me.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.710 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, I really
wanted to feel like her.

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:14.670 align:middle line:84%
She had bright white
teeth, big blue eyes.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I took the tube of toothpaste
and was putting it in my teeth,

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.270 align:middle line:90%
starting chewing.

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I had white
teeth, white spots all over.

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and my whole family
chuckled for a long time.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's really fun
to have that guardian

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.060 align:middle line:84%
angel, guardian spiritual
person with me all the time.

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so glad
I am able to draw it,

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:44.080 align:middle line:84%
so people could see who
and what I was seeing.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.230 align:middle line:90%
