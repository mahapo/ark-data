it is a map of sensitive
sites, including

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:84%

132 establishments are affected.

meters away from the yard

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
are vines as far
as the eye can see.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The building, with 100 or so
children inside, is surrounded.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
To measure the exposure of the
children from these schools,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
we suggest a little
experiment to their parents.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We will need some gloves
and a pair of scissors.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
At the exits of those
establishments located

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
close to the vineyards,
we take a lock of hair

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:90%
from the children.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
In total, we take hair
samples of 20 children

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
from four elementary
schools which

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
are classed as sensitive

spraying that is carried out.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we send the samples
to a public laboratory

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:84%

childhood cancers have been

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
increasing at a rate

of Childhood Leukemia, a child's
risk of developing a leukemia

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
is 20% higher than

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Is there a link between
these illnesses and exposure

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to pesticides?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
For French scientists, there
is not a shadow of a doubt.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, Inserm, the French
Institute of Health and Medical

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%

an appraisal report

on the impact of pesticides
on health for the first time.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In the long list of illnesses
linked to pesticides,

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
two catch our attention-- two
childhood cancers, brain tumors

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:90%
and leukemia, in children.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So inevitably we
ask the question,

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:84%
who is responsible for this
heavy reliance on pesticides?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:90%
The farmers?

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They themselves breathe in
the products that they spray.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
They are victims too.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:84%

from this, those

Folpet.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It's classified as a likely

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:90%

Folpet is one of

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The stakes are pretty
high, if you imagine.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
In terms of weight,
the amount of Folpet

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
sold each year in France is
the equivalent of nearly 5

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
billion aspirin tablets.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we take a
closer look, Folpet

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
can be found virtually
everywhere in France, even

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%

over 15 of France's 22 regions.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
There is no danger of Bayer
getting a slap on the wrist

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
either, as there are
no regulations that

are due to decide
this year whether they

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.600 align:middle line:90%
should ban chlorpyrifos.

But in this fight
against pesticides,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
politicians and citizens don't
always have the last word.

the island of surfing,

impedes these trials,

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:84%

>> In the opposing camp,
the people spent $82,807.21.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.358 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:90%

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> After months
of confrontation,

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.280 align:middle line:90%
the law was finally passed.

Harry!

>> But while Hawaii slept, the
pesticide lobby was already

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.980 align:middle line:90%
formulating its counterattack.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.920 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks after this
historic moment, Syngenta,

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Dow, DuPont, and
BASF filed charges

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.620 align:middle line:90%
against the island of Kauai.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto did the same with the
neighboring island of Maui.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.640 align:middle line:84%
These chemical giants
contested that the councils

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the right to
pass such laws and on what

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:90%
grounds exactly.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It would be better to go
and ask them in person.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:84%
At DuPont, nobody wanted
to see us, nor at BASF.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
At Dow, they were not
allowed to talk to the press.

we showed our press badge,

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:84%

It was only Syngenta
that would give us

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes of its time--

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:90%
off camera.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the site's
managers received us,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.500 align:middle line:84%
but he did not
want to be filmed.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:84%
We spoke to him in front of a
lovely picture of a Syngenta

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.516 align:middle line:90%
flower.

00:48:41.516 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the
questions we have--

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Hawaii's heat was starting
to make us hallucinate.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what he had to say.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's worth its
weight in sunflowers.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --why did you
guys decide to sue?

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The concern is that if you
have to state everything about

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:84%
exactly where you're
doing exactly what,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:84%
then they would make it more
likely that people would go

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.520 align:middle line:90%
into the field and burn it down.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The bill was also
about disclosure--

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.410 align:middle line:84%
the type of pesticide,
the quantity of pesticide.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.370 align:middle line:90%
How was that a problem?

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So a part of it is really the
administrative burden of having

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.600 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Administration burden.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So for us as a large company,
again, we can actually do that.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But for all of the
smaller farmers,

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:84%
if they have to do that and
record everything the way

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.033 align:middle line:84%
that we do, they
might actually--

00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have staff.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:29.985 align:middle line:84%
>> You cannot stand
up for these farmers?

00:49:29.985 --> 00:49:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> In reality, only agricultural
companies that use significant

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:84%
quantities of pesticides
are affected by this law,

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.060 align:middle line:90%
not the small farmers.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The appeal ruling on the
neighboring island of Maui

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.420 align:middle line:84%
was due to be
given the next day.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Before going, we decided to
adopt some local customs.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We picked some flowers right
next to the test fields,

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.930 align:middle line:84%
right where these agrochemical
multinationals spray thousands

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.205 align:middle line:90%
of tons of pesticides.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the
county courthouse.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The hearing was due to
start in just a few minutes.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to film
inside the building.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Two hours later and
against all expectations,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.880 align:middle line:84%
the judges ruled in favor
of the multinationals

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:90%
and invalidated the law.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
The eight lawyers from
the pesticide industry

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:90%
left the courthouse.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Marjorie Bronster
led the appeal.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> --from friends of
the French National TV.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Now for this-- it's
a lei from Maui.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I offer you?

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you may.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, how would you--

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.590 align:middle line:90%
put it like this, OK.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:51.298 align:middle line:84%
We took the samples from
the GMO fields down in Maui.

00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:53.090 align:middle line:84%
These flowers actually
are from GMO fields.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.430 align:middle line:84%
They might be full of
pesticides still though.

00:50:56.430 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know what
you think about that.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.770 align:middle line:84%

you think of the fact

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that a democratic
process being challenged

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
by big companies like the one
you represent, Dow, [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:90%
or even Monsanto?

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.103 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:51:11.103 --> 00:51:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I represent a lot
of parties in this case.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are
large companies.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you
that the question

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that the court had
to address is who

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:middle line:90%
has the authority to regulate.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The court is not
going to be addressing

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the question of whether the
pesticides are good or bad.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's really a question as
to whether the county has

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.500 align:middle line:84%
the right to step in and
regulate in this area.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And our position is simply
that this is not a county area.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It is for the state or the
federal government to regulate,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
regulating this area.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the people from
Maui did not vote correctly?

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean--

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to insist, because
we've-- you know we traveled

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.450 align:middle line:90%
a long way to come here.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So do you think the people from
Maui did not vote correctly?

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> As I mentioned in court and
as I think the question is,

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:84%
do the voters have the right
to regulate in this area?

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.830 align:middle line:90%
We believe that they do not.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of message do you
think that sends to the people

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that believe that votes
can change things?

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly, the initiative
process is appropriate

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in certain areas, but we do
not believe that this is one

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.270 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.412 align:middle line:84%
Very last question,
Miss Bronster, and I'll

00:52:22.412 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:90%
leave you alone.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you personally believe
that the pesticides used

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.440 align:middle line:84%
on Maui, on Kauai and large
islands-- some of there

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.300 align:middle line:84%
are neurotoxic, some of there
are carcinogenic, some of them

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.090 align:middle line:90%
are toxic for the fetus.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is
good for a community?

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you think for the
children it's good as well?

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> As I mentioned, that's
not what this case is about,

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to get into it.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.153 align:middle line:84%

do you think about that?

reeling.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.370 align:middle line:90%

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:90%
it's saying we don't count.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:84%
What it's saying is
that corporations, yeah,

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:14.060 align:middle line:84%
have more importance in their
world than we the people

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and the children, yeah?

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We go through this
belief of having

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.480 align:middle line:84%
the right to express
ourselves and vote,

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and we have done that.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:29.612 align:middle line:84%

then they holed everything up.
