Plastic is irreplaceable,

at the center of our lives.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes tricky when
we need to throw it away.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The world is
drowning in plastic.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And the artist Mandy Barker
collects it on the beaches

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and in the seas throughout
the world and displays it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate what we
cannot otherwise see,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that plastic is now an
integral part of our oceans,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.945 align:middle line:90%
like algae and plankton.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But paradoxically, in our seas
and our oceans far from sight,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.025 align:middle line:84%
we can only find a small
amount of the plastic waste

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:18.825 align:middle line:90%
that we produce.

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:90%
So what happens to it?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it at the bottom
of the ocean?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Has it made its way
into the food chain?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Has it disintegrated
in such tiny pieces

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:90%
that we lose all trace of it?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Scientists from around
the world are on the case

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and are wondering
whether it is modifying

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
the ecosystem without
us being able to measure

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
the consequences.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
In Massachusetts in the
USA, Kara Lavender Law

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
leads the Sea Education
Association programs,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
which for 35 years have taught
students about navigation

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
and oceanography.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Their two boats have
traveled through the Atlantic

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
and Pacific Oceans for years.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Kara Lavender Law therefore
has the most extensive series

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
of samples of ocean
plastic going back in time.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Looking at her
collection, she came up

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
with an original question.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we have such a
longtime series in the North

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Atlantic, we were able
to ask the question,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
in the region of the ocean
where the plastics accumulate,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is that amount of plastic
increasing over time?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> But what data
do we have today?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
According to recent
studies, the number

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
of bits of plastic
on the surface

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
could be up to 15,000
billion pieces.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
They're everywhere
from the Arctic

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to the Antarctic
via the tropics.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
They are often almost invisible
because the immense majority

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of these pieces measure
less than 5 millimeters.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We also know that a good
half of these pieces

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
accumulate at the
heart of whirlpools

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.045 align:middle line:84%
of water formed by the marine
currents, oceanic gyre.

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Today we can find five
zones of accumulation,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
two in the Pacific,
two in the Atlantic,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and one in the Indian Ocean.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
We often refer to them
as plastic continents.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Until now, we thought
that the amount of plastic

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
had increased over time in
these zones of accumulation.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But faced with her
unique collection,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.763 align:middle line:90%
Kara came up with another idea.

00:04:16.763 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But what was interesting
is when we looked at the total

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
amount of plastic collecting
in the subtropical gyre,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
we found that the
amount is level.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It's steady.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.545 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see a very strong
increase like we expected.

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't think
that the reason is

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.462 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten
better at recycling

00:04:31.462 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
or better at keeping our
plastic out of the ocean,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
but instead we think that once
the plastic is floating out

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
here for years, somehow it gets
removed from the sea surface.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Intrigued, Kara Lavender Law
decided then to try to work out

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
the amount of plastic on
the surface of the ocean.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Her latest study, the
most thorough of our time,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
found up to 236,000 tons.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is only 1% of
the amount of waste estimated

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to enter the ocean in
a single year alone.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very small number.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's surprising because there's
so much plastic going in

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and we have no idea where it is.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 1%.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We can only find 1% of
the plastic in the ocean.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
To better understand
it, we have to look

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
at the scale of
plastic production.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, it was 1.5
million tons per year.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is closer to
300 million tons per year.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The quantity of plastic
floating on the surface

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean
estimated by Kara Law

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.285 align:middle line:84%
is nothing compared to
what we should be finding.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The danger is that
people think, oh, well,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
it's just gone.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not a problem
because it's not there

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, actually it's
the fear of the unknown.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
If we don't know where it is,
we don't know what it's doing.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if it's
having other impacts that we

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:90%
haven't even conceived of yet.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Finding out where the plastic
is has become a major concern

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
its effects and its role

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:90%
in the ecosystem.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But we must begin
at the very start.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
How much plastic
enters our oceans?

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Although this question has
been asked since the 1970s,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
the first response
was given in 2015

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
by Jenna Jambeck, an
engineer specialized

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%
in the management of waste.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Her study took
three and 1/2 years.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We looked at 192 countries
in the world with a coastline

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and a 50 km buffer where waste
might make it into the ocean

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
by either being washed
or blown into the ocean.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, we
estimated the percent

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of plastic that is mismanaged.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We quantified and estimated
that 8 million metric tons

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of plastic entered
the ocean in 2010.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Out of the 275 million
tons of plastic waste,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
32 million tons are not properly
managed, namely either buried,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
burned, or recycled.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And out of these 32 million
tons, eight million finish

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The merit of this
study is to give

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
an idea of the
scale of the problem

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and to show that it can be
solved on land by a better

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:90%
management of plastic waste.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
According to Jenna
Jandyke, if we do nothing,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
10 times more plastic will
enter our oceans in 2025.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Once in the sea, it is too late.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.335 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible to
retrieve and we lose its trace.

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
However, the hunt for
its trace is not new.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:90%
It started around 20 years ago.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
One of those involved
is Francois Galgani

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:84%
He is not only well-known
for his studies

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.491 align:middle line:90%
but also for his commitment.

00:08:26.491 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to him, plastic
has become an indicator

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
when measuring water quality
in the European Union.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, Francois
Galgani created

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
a groundbreaking
project, checking

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
the seabed for plastic
on board "Nautile,"

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Ifremer's legendary submarine.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
His pictures spread
around the world

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and were the inspiration
for his model.

floating on the surface?

the oceanographer Erik van

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Sebille studies marine currents.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:84%
He is therefore interested
in gyres, the zones

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
where more than half of
the plastic on the surface

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
accumulates.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
We generally consider
that these five gyres

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
act as a sort of terminus
where the pieces of plastic

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
end their journey after
entering the seas.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Erik van Sebille drops
buoys into the water

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that transmit their
location and act largely

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.895 align:middle line:90%
like pieces of plastic.

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They illustrate the
chaos of the oceans.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Two buoys dropped just
meters from each other

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
are found hundreds of kilometers
apart after a couple of weeks.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
This data brings a
better understanding

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:90%
of these accumulation zones.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Importantly, we recently
found that these garbage

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
patches are not black holes.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:84%
They are not the
end all of plastic.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It is not that once a plastic
particle enters a garbage patch

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:90%
it will stay there.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the garbage
patches are rather leaky.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Plastic can go into
a garbage patch

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly leak out and
enter into another garbage

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
patch.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So all the garbage
patches are actually

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:90%
connected to each other.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's constant
transport of plastic

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
between the different
garbage patches.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we understand that
actually, because there's

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
all this movement
of plastic around,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.935 align:middle line:84%
everybody's plastic in the
end can end up everywhere.

00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Erik produced a model of
the route of plastic waste.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, depending on
where they enter the water,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:43.857 align:middle line:84%
it takes 10 years to reach
their first gyre, years

00:12:43.857 --> 00:12:45.065 align:middle line:90%
during which they will decay.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the immense
majority of pieces of plastic

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:84%
found are smaller
than 5 millimeters

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and are known as microplastics.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And far from what
is usually assumed,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
these zones look nothing
like the plastic continents

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:90%
that are often talked about.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
In this room where
we're sitting on now,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
if this would be
the garbage patch,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
we would maybe have 30 or 40
tiny, tiny pieces of plastic.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The garbage fetches
are a very thin soup

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
of very small piece of plastic.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
They're not islands of trash.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
They are not continents,
nothing like that.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> These microplastics have
drawn the attention of many

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
They are the heart
of the problem

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
because they are much more
numerous than macroplastics.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And their ability to enter the
environment seems infinite.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:50.855 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we're doing is
trying to understand how

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.297 align:middle line:84%
different types of plastic
materials break down

00:13:56.297 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:90%
in the marine environment.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the ocean exposed
to sunlight and the turbulence

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:90%
of waves and currents.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.873 align:middle line:84%
And they somehow have gone from
a large item to microplastics.

00:14:05.873 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
long that takes.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how different that

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
is for certain types of plastic
versus other types of plastic.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So we know that two common
plastics float in seawater.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Those are polyethylene
and polypropylene.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Polyethylene is
used to make things

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:90%
like milk jugs or plastic bags.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Polypropylene is used for
things like bottle caps, straws,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and dairy containers.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.336 align:middle line:84%
So these are products
that we use everyday.

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Kara Lavender Law looks
at how pieces of polyethylene

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.085 align:middle line:84%
and polypropylene fragment
and which are more resistant

00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:42.885 align:middle line:90%
or more fragile.

00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The plastic splits
into such small pieces

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that they go through the mesh of
the nets used by the scientists

00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to take their samples even
though these holes are just

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:90%
a third of a millimeter wide.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
This decay explains,
in part, our difficulty

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.655 align:middle line:90%
to find the missing plastic.

00:15:09.655 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Richard Thompson
was the first person

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to bring the strange
disappearance of plastic

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to our attention in
a paper published

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
in 2004 in the journal "Science"
entitled "Lost at Sea."

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We were showing now
pieces of plastic 20 microns

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
or so in size, pieces smaller
than the diameter of a human

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
hair.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody had counted
pieces that small before.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So before we started
looking at that,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
those really small pieces had
not been part of monitoring.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.887 align:middle line:90%
They'd not been recorded.

00:15:56.887 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And we were finding
them everywhere we look.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So it occurred to me
that this might actually

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
represent a substantial
part of the marine debris,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
the plastic debris now.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We must keep in mind that
the quantity of microplastic

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
over the next few
years will still

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
increase because of the
fragmentation of what

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I would call the legacy
items, the large items

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
of plastic debris that
are already in the ocean.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So we need to understand
more about them.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to know where they are,
where they're most abundant.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, these microplastics
are at the heart of the paradox

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.220 align:middle line:90%
of this disappearance.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
They are everywhere and yet
extremely difficult to find.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
However, in 2014, a
possible lead appeared.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
An American scientist, Rachel
Obbard was working on ice caps.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
She noticed minuscule colored
fragments in her samples.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:84%
She sent them to
Richard Thompson.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So amongst the
various different sinks,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the places where substantial
quantities of microplastic are

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
accumulating, the data from
Rachel suggests that the Arctic

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:84%
could be an important
sink for particles.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
There's a phenomena of
the formation of sea ice

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
that actually
causes particulates

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
in the seawater to become
concentrated in the ice itself

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:90%
as it forms.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And this may be why we found
such high concentrations

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.784 align:middle line:84%
of microplastic in the sea
ice from those samples.

00:17:24.784 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Extrapolating from data
from a variety of samples,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Rachel Abard and Richard
Thompson concluded that melting

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the ice cap would free 1,000
billion particles of plastics

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
into the water in
the next 10 years,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
constituting one of the biggest
reservoirs of plastic waste

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
These microplastics seem
to be in permanent transit.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible that
they lie on the seabed?

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
No proof of this had been found
until a biologist contacted

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Richard in 2015.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm here at the Natural
History Museum in London

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:90%
to meet Dr. Lucy Woodall.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Lucy contacted me to
say that among some

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:84%
of the samples of sediment
she'd been examining

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
from the deep sea, pieces of
sediment thousands of meters

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
beneath the sea surface,
she'd been finding

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
small brightly colored pieces.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
They looked a little
bit unusual to her.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good morning.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Lucy.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Good to meet you.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucy Woodall studies
organisms living on sea mounts

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom of the Indian
Ocean at depths between 300

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and 3,000 meters.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> There are corals.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised initially
because on the cruise,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
my aim wasn't to
find microplastics.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, I didn't know
they existed while I was at sea.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But once I came back
to the lab and I

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
was having a look for the very
small worms, that nematodes,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:84%
then I was finding these
fibrous items in the sediments.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know what they were
because they hadn't previously

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:90%
been recorded in the deep sea.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can see our
fibers entangled right

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:90%
around these polyps.

>> In the museum's collection,
Lucy shows Richard species from

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the depths, including worms
and corals upon which she also

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.805 align:middle line:90%
found microplastics.

00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to examine what
you found the microplastic in.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only had we never
found them on the seabed,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
but the concentration of
microplastics was 1,000 times

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
higher than on the surface.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
For Richard Thompson,
this is a major discovery.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So roughly what is the
area that we're seeing here?

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It brings the beginning of
an answer to the disappearance

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:90%
of plastic waste.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of all, it shows
that microplastics

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
travel through water
columns to reach the seabed

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and therefore multiply the risks
of encountering marine fauna.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
If we're thinking of a risk
assessment for marine life,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
it's the probability
of an encounter

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
coupled with the severity
of that encounter.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we know where the
plastic's accumulating

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
most of all, we know where the
greatest potential for risk

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are the big
questions hidden behind

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.800 align:middle line:90%
the quest to find microplastics.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
How do they interact
with the ecosystem?

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Are they totally passive or do
they affect the equilibrium?

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
In what measure have they
entered marine organisms

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.882 align:middle line:90%
and therefore the food chain?

00:21:06.882 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the possible routes
do you think, the pathways,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that might lead to encounter
with the microplastic in these

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Organisms

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the question, isn't it?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Would those
microplastics accumulate?

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Does it take a
long time for them

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:90%
to go through their bodies?

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.433 align:middle line:84%
So some really great
questions, but I

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
think at the moment that's
actually really hard to answer.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And these questions are
being asked around the world.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Not a month goes by without
an article describing

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:90%
another affected species.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, scientists
had identified

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
560 species which
had either ingested

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.365 align:middle line:90%
or been trapped by plastic.

00:21:56.365 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%

doubled in 20 years.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
The large majority
of organisms appear

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to be affected from
prey to predators,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
from immense whales to minuscule
plankton, the very bottom

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:90%
of the food chain.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:90%

expedition, which took

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:90%
to the seas for seven months.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
They found plastic
all the 350 times

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:90%
that they cast their nets.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Above all, they
focused on the relation

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.435 align:middle line:84%
between the quantity of plastic
and the quantity of plankton.

when an organism ingests
a piece of plastic?

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Does it simply pass
through its body

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
before being rejected
without any unwanted effects

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
or are the repercussions
more harmful than that?

>> In Toronto, the
ecotoxicologist Chelsea Rossman

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
has been working on the
subject for a few years.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And if she's
interested in plastic,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
it's because it's not so neutral
once it enters the water.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> In the ocean--

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.130 align:middle line:84%
let's imagine this
is the ocean--

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of chemicals that
are already there via runoff,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.265 align:middle line:84%
urban runoff, agricultural
runoff, et cetera.

00:26:37.265 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's pretend that
all these chemicals are

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
different types or
all these colors

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:84%
are different
types of chemicals.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And then we add our plastic.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we
refer to plastics

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:84%
as like a cocktail of
contaminants or chemicals.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
this plastic already

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
has some chemicals on
it from manufacturing.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But you put it in
the water and it's

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
like a magnet for some
of these other chemicals.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So once it goes in the water
and it's floating around,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it's actually going to pick up
and accumulate these chemicals

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
on its surface and sometimes
even within the plastics.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And so then we end
up with this plastic

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that is like this
cocktail of chemicals.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And then if an animal eats
it, some of these chemicals

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
may indeed transfer
to the animal.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Plastic doesn't only
aggregate the chemical

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
pollutants contained in
the surrounding water.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:90%

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Each plastic is unique
due to the additives

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that we use to give it
its characteristics,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
whether that's its color,
its flexibility, or its fire

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:90%

>> When we've gone into the
ocean to see what contaminants

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.623 align:middle line:84%
is associated with plastic
can we find in an animal,

00:28:00.623 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the one that really seems
to stand out are the flame

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:90%
retardants.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And the flame retardants, again,
are an ingredient of plastic.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Some plastics by
nature may already

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:84%
be more hazardous when
they enter the water.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.065 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what I think
is most important for wildlife.

00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelsea Rossman is
therefore looking to evaluate

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the toxicological effects of
microplastics while respecting

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.185 align:middle line:84%
the environmental conditions
as much as possible.

00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
She simulates the
concentrations of microplastics

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.952 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the
zones of accumulation

00:28:45.952 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the oceans.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
She drops small plastic
beads into the water

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
so that they can fill up
with surrounding pollutants

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
before adding them to the
diet of groups of fish.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And so really this right
here is the liver of a fish.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
When we look at a
fish that was fed

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle line:84%
the plastic with the
chemical, this circle,

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:84%
this is one quarter of
the liver of this fish.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's a full blown tumor,
so hepatocellular adenoma.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And we don't expect to see
a tumor like we see here

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
in a fish that's about eight or
nine months old because they're

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
really not old enough
to be developing

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:90%
cancer and tumors naturally.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So this we think is
indeed likely caused

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.355 align:middle line:84%
by that combination

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.605 align:middle line:90%
with those chemicals combined.

00:29:35.605 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> In general, scientists
are not all in agreement

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
on the question of the impact
of plastic on organisms.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.925 align:middle line:84%
For some, it is essential
and for others marginal.

00:29:48.925 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:90%
But all agree with one point.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The situation is
becoming serious.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The alert being sent out
concerns its integration

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
into the food chain as if
plastic was getting closer

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and closer to our plates.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
To better understand
the question,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.982 align:middle line:84%
Chelsea visited
many fishmongers.

00:30:18.982 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.482 align:middle line:84%
For your dorado, do those have
the stomach in there as well?

00:30:24.482 --> 00:30:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that what those are?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.966 align:middle line:90%
>> We want the stomach.

00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:30.934 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Take care.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Have a good weekend.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:90%
You too.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm really interested in
trying to understand if there

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is a link between the chemicals
in the plastic and the seafood

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:90%
that we eat.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:90%
So recently I did a study.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And I purchased fish
from fish markets

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:84%
in California and
also in Indonesia.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And we found
plastic in about 25%

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of the fish that we purchased
and in about a third

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of all the oysters
that we purchased.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> They found microplastics
in the stomach of a quarter

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
of the fish that were bought
and in a third of the oysters.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:84%
This data creates
questions about the impact

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:90%
of microplastics on our health.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:90%
What are the effects?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.900 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
There are still very few
studies but one of these

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:90%
is very telling.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Colin Janssen leads the
environmental toxicology

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
laboratory in Ghent.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:90%
His team works on mussels.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
They have found plastic in
every single one studied.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And unlike with
fish where we don't

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:84%
eat the stomach, with muscles
we eat the whole thing.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
According to their
study, someone

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
who eats a large
quantity of mussels

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
will ingest up to 11,000 pieces
of microplastic per year.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Colin Janssen then focused
on the concentration

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of associated PCB to
evaluate its toxicity.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What we concluded for
this worst case is that

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
it's the contribution of
these PCBs associated with

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
microplastics are still 1,000
to 10,000 times lower than

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the safe value recommended by
the World Health Organization.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So although the microplastics
might be a vector,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:90%
it is a very minor vector.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The conclusions
are reassuring,

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
at least concerning the intake
of pollutants into our bodies.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But Colin Janssen didn't
stop his research.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know what
happened to the plastic

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
when it had penetrated
the organism.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Does it stay in the stomach
for a certain amount of time

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.630 align:middle line:84%
before being expelled
from the body

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.715 align:middle line:84%
or does it migrate
to other organs?

00:33:04.715 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.590 align:middle line:84%
His laboratory is
one of the very

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
few to have shown
that microplastics

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:84%
can cross the intestinal
wall and migrate

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
towards the circulatory
system in both the blood

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and lymphatic fluid.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We see clearly in the
lumen the microplastics.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And the question is now do they
move from here into the tissue.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
closely, we clearly

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:84%
see here also microplastics,
so not in the lumen

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
anymore but taken
up by the tissue.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> To put it another way, it can
end up in other organs without

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:90%
us knowing the consequences.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Colin Janssen is now
asking the same question

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:90%
concerning humans.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The study was done
in a laboratory.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.790 align:middle line:84%
He exposed human
intestinal cells

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to very high concentrations
of plastic particles

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:90%
measuring just two microns.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:90%
His goal?

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:84%
To obtain a theoretical
rate of transfer

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to determine the
number of particles

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:90%
that stay within our bodies.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're a really
big mussel eater,

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:84%
you have 60 microplastics
per year translocated from

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
your seafood to your underlying
tissues in your intestine.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, the main
question is now does it matter?

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:84%
Do these 60 particles
in the worst case

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:90%
cause adverse effects in man?

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, this is
something we haven't solved yet.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that medical doctors

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
need to look at and try
to provide answers for.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:90%
The circle is closed.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
We throw our plastic away
and it ends up in our bodies.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Its toxicity is being
studied and it has totally

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
penetrated the
marine environment

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
scientists consider today

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that the toxicological
risks are minor when

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:90%
compared to ecological risks.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Can plastic in its
microscopic form

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.075 align:middle line:84%
put the entire marine
ecosystem in danger?

00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:46.790 align:middle line:90%

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria-Luiza Pedrotti found
that 40% of their samples

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of plastic are colonized
by algae or crustaceans.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Are microplastics a major
vector in the dispersion

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
of these species?

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons to
think this is the case.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:84%
For a few years,
oceanographers have

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.260 align:middle line:84%
consider that plastic debris
are a new mode of transport.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The arrival of 120 species
on the Canadian coast

from a large piece of plastic
from the Japanese tsunami

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.810 align:middle line:90%
was enough to persuade them.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But unlike boats,
which are often

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:84%
vectors in the
introduction of species,

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
plastic doesn't go from
A to B but with the ebb

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.630 align:middle line:90%
and flow of the tides.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to disperse
species is thus infinite.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Their slow moving speed allows
the fauna and flora to adapt.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
They act like rafts conveying

a liter of seawater.

And believe it or not, there's
about a billion bacteria

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in this one sample here and
10 to the fourth smaller

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
organisms, also microbes
but that are sort of

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
like the plants that live in the
ocean that give us about half

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:90%
of the oxygen that we breathe.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And to it I'm going to
add one of these pellets.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So just by adding this
one drop of plastic,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
we're transforming this
community into something

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:90%
we don't know yet.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
these kinds of surfaces

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:90%
don't exist naturally.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.985 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
this new habitat

00:38:46.985 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:84%

better understand.

>> So I've got some of
our incubation samples.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.157 align:middle line:84%
So here's the edge
of the plastic.

00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There's actually some
animals, some invertebrates.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a hydroid right there.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a colonial animal
so those are coming off there.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the surface
just looks kind of crusty.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But if I start
zooming in, you can

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:84%
see that it's just loaded
with diatoms as we zoom in.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole surface is
practically covered

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:90%
with these pennate diatoms.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You can see how many
diatoms are on this one

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:90%
but there's all kinds of stuff.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:02.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:02.235 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It's covered.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.725 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.725 --> 00:40:07.975 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know what that
is but I want to look at it.

00:40:07.975 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh oh.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.343 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:40:13.343 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> At first I thought it was
a ciliate lined with bacteria

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It is the ciliate.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the ciliate, no?

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about this particular one

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is the surface of
it is completely

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:90%
covered with little bacteria.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:90%
See each of these is a bacteria.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.782 align:middle line:90%
You can see some are dividing.

00:40:41.782 --> 00:40:43.240 align:middle line:84%
That one's just
starting to divide.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That one's almost
completely divided.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:90%
These are dividing.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.380 align:middle line:90%
So we know they're growing.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.780 align:middle line:90%
They're not just stuck there.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The very first time when
we looked at these pieces

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of plastic-- now remember
these are really tiny,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.840 align:middle line:84%
probably half the size
of my pinky nail--

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:84%
what we saw were some very
fascinating, basically little

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.860 align:middle line:84%
worlds, if you will,
of microbial life.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.120 align:middle line:90%
We found predators.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We found prey.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:84%
We found organisms
that will actually

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.710 align:middle line:84%
parasitize other organisms
and even symbiotes.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So this told us
that it was really

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
a self-sustaining
little ecosystem that

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
was floating out there in
the ocean gyres and garbage

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:90%
patches.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They discovered
a world in itself,

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
an ecosystem that
existed alongside others,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
special communities different
to those that developed

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
on a natural medium
such as wood or algae.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And among the
organisms identified

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.660 align:middle line:84%
on the pieces of plastic,
one of them is intriguing.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the first pieces
of microplastics that we

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.990 align:middle line:84%
characterized the bacterial
communities on, we found that

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
there were very large
numbers of these vibrios.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And vibrios are interesting
because some of them,

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
not all of them,
but some of them

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.245 align:middle line:84%
cause disease in
animals and humans.

00:42:09.245 --> 00:42:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Vibrio bacteria constituted
up to 25% of the microbial

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.240 align:middle line:90%
cover of a piece of plastic.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
known to carry cholera.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
This finding requires
at least some attention.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Tracy Mincer, associated
with Linda and Eric's research,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:84%
has shown that the vibrios had
specific attachment mechanisms

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:84%
which allow them to stick to
plastic very quickly and very

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.320 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:84%
These bacteria also have
genetic characteristics

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.690 align:middle line:84%
that allow them to
attach themselves

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to fish's intestinal tissue,
causing a real danger

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.720 align:middle line:90%
to fish stocks.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't have the really
serious pathogenic abilities

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that would affect humans.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense because
these vibrios are not

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:90%
interacting with humans at all.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:90%
They're interacting with fish.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And so what we think
might be happening

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.950 align:middle line:84%
is that the plastic could serve
as a vector for these vibrios

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to get around, and
get into other fish,

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:34.465 align:middle line:84%
and transmit a parasitic or
pathogenic burden to fish

00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:35.265 align:middle line:90%
stocks.

00:43:35.265 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> A Trojan horse for
pathogenic bacteria and a raft

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:90%
for invasive species.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:84%
These microplastics
could be the vector

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.330 align:middle line:84%
for significant transformations
in the marine environment.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Studies are in their infancy
and yet scientists are already

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
alerting us to the
danger that they

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
could be harmful
for the equilibrium

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.571 align:middle line:90%
of this environment.

00:44:01.571 --> 00:44:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But when observing these
microbial communities,

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.460 align:middle line:84%
the three American
researchers also

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.280 align:middle line:84%
made another
surprising discovery.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the bacteria
have the ability

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.275 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate the process
of decay of the plastic.

00:44:22.275 --> 00:44:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> A surprising finding was that
many of the microbes that we

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
were finding in the plastisphere
had also been found in oil

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.260 align:middle line:84%
spills, for example, and other
hydrocarbon degradation types

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.680 align:middle line:90%
of experiments.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we found that was really
compelling based on the idea

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that microbes that are
associated with those plastics

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:84%
may also have the
capability to degrade

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:90%
plastics or those hydrocarbons.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.640 align:middle line:90%
We're still looking into that.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's some good
evidence by microscopy

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
microbes are actually

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:84%
able to accelerate the
weathering or the hydroloysis,

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.720 align:middle line:84%
the breakdown of plastics in
the wild in the open ocean.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.300 align:middle line:84%
As in the scanning
electron micrographs,

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.490 align:middle line:84%
we saw these things we
call the pit formers.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are little two to
four micrometer round cells,

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.020 align:middle line:84%
spherical cells, that appear
to be embedded in pits

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:90%
in the surface of the plastic.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're metabolizing
it or just physically

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:84%
breaking it down by the way
they attach, we don't know.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But that's one piece of
evidence that they're

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.800 align:middle line:84%
impacting the plastic and
perhaps breaking it down.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.062 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.062 --> 00:45:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes sense.

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Bacteria capable
of decaying plastic.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Eric, Linda, and Tracy
examined this question.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And there is now
no doubt that they

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.060 align:middle line:84%
have a role in the fragmentation
of plastic in the oceans.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But are the bacteria able to
metabolize and therefore cause

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.485 align:middle line:84%
the plastic to totally
disappear from our oceans?

00:46:20.485 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:31.075 align:middle line:84%
Today there is evidence
that this is the case.

00:46:31.075 --> 00:46:36.800 align:middle line:90%

Microbial Biology Laboratory

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:84%

totally consume different types
of plastic from the ocean.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.580 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria have developed
a complex strategy

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.740 align:middle line:90%
for ingesting the plastic.

because these plastic particles

are not edible and are too big.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria, therefore,
start by sending enzymes

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
outside their cell
to oxidize them.

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Once there is oxygen
on the polymer,

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria send other
extracellular enzymes

The process of decay of
plastic in the sea is complex.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Tens of thousands of bacteria
are implicated and follow

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
each other over time without us
knowing exactly who does what.

absorb plastic,

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.870 align:middle line:84%
they can still only

They are not the
miracle solution

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to the mystery that remains.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Nature can adapt, but it cannot
follow our frantic consumption

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and our inability to
manage the resulting waste.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.180 align:middle line:84%
For a few years now,
the scientific community

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:84%
has tried to understand what
happens once plastic enters

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the sea, questioning not only
its fate but also its effects.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They have identified
microplastics

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.890 align:middle line:84%
as a source of preoccupation
and are already

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.400 align:middle line:84%
wondering whether nanoplastics,
even smaller particles,

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.300 align:middle line:90%
are not even worse.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But today we are still
measuring the time

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:45.428 align:middle line:84%
and the rate of decay of
these plastics in our oceans.

00:50:45.428 --> 00:50:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We're very much
at the first step.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We're asking the
most basic questions.

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:84%
We're just trying to assemble
all of the information

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that we can find in
order to see if we

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:56.750 align:middle line:90%
can answer these questions.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.370 align:middle line:90%
For the most part, we can't.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But on the other hand, we
do have some answers and some

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about ways that we
could perhaps prevent plastic

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:90%
entering the ocean.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.398 align:middle line:90%


00:51:12.398 --> 00:51:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Way to keep plastic out of
the ocean is to stop putting it

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Stop it at the shore, the
rivers, the landfills,

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:24.780 align:middle line:84%
the waste dumps, just
human choice basically.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not about
not using plastics.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It's about using them
much more smartly.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And what that, in my
view, is going to take

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is rethinking the
way we produce, use,

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.190 align:middle line:90%
and dispose of plastics.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And the increasing realization
is that there really

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.540 align:middle line:90%
isn't any away on the planet.

It is time to realize this
before this piece of art

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that we come across by
chance in an airport morphs
