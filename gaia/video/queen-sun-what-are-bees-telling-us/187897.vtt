that we should actually

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.295 align:middle line:84%

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most beneficial
and healing substances

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:90%
that we can imagine.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It has enzymes,
it has nutrients,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
it has trace minerals, and
it has forces of the hexagon.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:90%
The silica force is in it.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And silica is a substance
in the Earth's mantle.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
About half of the
Earth's mantle is silica.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The silica in us is mainly
in the sense organs.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the sensing for what
goes on in the surrounding.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So the silica and the honey
have a beneficial influence

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
on our evolution.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Mainly from the
19th century on, we

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
have gone into controlling
nature more and more,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and we have lost that
feeling for the sacredness.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Steiner gave lectures to the
workers at the Goetheanum

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in 1923, and Steiner said
yes, this mechanization

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of beekeeping,
this realm of life,

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is becoming mechanized
and industrialized.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And that will eventually
destroy beekeeping.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And the honeybee might not
survive the end of the century,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:90%
that is, the 20th century.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So now with the colony
collapse disorder,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that Steiner's
prediction has come true.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And as Steiner said, our very
lives depend on beekeeping.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Everybody should be
interested in beekeeping.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Our lives depend on it.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Look at the beautiful honey.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that we are
seeing changes in climate,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
but I think the colony
collapse disorder

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and the disappearance
of the honeybee

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.885 align:middle line:84%
is a much more pressing
urgent problem to solve.

00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of rationalization,
a lot of mechanization

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
has gone into beekeeping
to make it profitable.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And that has brought down
the honeybee in its vitality,

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
in its house.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's financial.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Financial.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We're accepting things that
aren't ideal for the bees,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because we have to for the
business that we're in.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the business
to stay in business,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:90%
so we have to do it.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:90%
You're going to take 10.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
He's going to take 14
when you're done here.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:90%
We are a mobile industry.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
We run hundreds of thousands
of miles every year.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Without the almond growers
and the high price,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
we would never have survived.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The almond crop is
our fastest-growing,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
most profitable export
crop here in California.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Every February, just
around Valentine's Day,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
has become the single greatest
pollination event in the world.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Bees from the entire
country, far away

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
as New England, and Wisconsin,
and Minnesota, and Florida

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
get on trucks in the
middle of the winter,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and 3/4 of all bees in America
come to California to perform

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
this absolutely critical act,
where they have to be woken up,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.248 align:middle line:84%
strengthened with high
fructose corn syrup.

00:13:41.248 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean if there's anything more
kind of viscerally offensive,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
it's the idea of feeding
the creators of honey

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:90%
high fructose corn syrup.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> When we feed the corn syrup,
we hope that there's enough

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
natural nectar and honey on
the hive to supplement whatever

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:90%
feed they get out of the syrup.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:12.362 align:middle line:84%
>> In Europe and America,
they are using a thing called

00:14:12.362 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
oxytetracycline, or
tetramycin in the sugar.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
The bees consume
the sugar, and then

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:90%
transfer it up into the honey.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, you eat that honey.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:90%
You eat that honey.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It's got oxytetracycline
or tetramycin in it.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.936 align:middle line:84%
And you then become
resistant to that antibiotic.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a 600,000 acre
monoculture of almonds

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Central Valley.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Problem is that every
one of those trees,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
every one of those blossoms,
needs a bee to visit it.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Yet, if there is nothing but
almonds in the Central Valley,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing to eat
for the bees for the 50

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:84%
weeks of the year that the
almonds aren't in bloom.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So there essentially
are no bees around.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not sustainable.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Two or three years ago, there
were not enough bees in America

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to pollinate the whole crop,
so the USDA gave permission

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to the growers to import
bees from Australia.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, as it happened,
Australian bees

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
harbor certain viruses that are
unfamiliar to American bees.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Israeli acute paralysis
virus is one of them.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We brought that in to
pollinate the almonds.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the
bees of America mixed.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
We've created this
great bee bordello,

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
as one beekeeper put it.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We constantly intermix
from all over the country.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So if they've got
something in one

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
part of the country
like tracheal mite,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have in
our part of the country,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
we certainly will have it,
because the migratory nature

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of beekeeping spreads all these
paths at a very rapid rate.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a single
event that causes

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:90%
the bees to go way downhill.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit here
and a little bit there.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
These semi load
trips, I believe,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%
caused huge stress on them.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Once the hive starts getting
stressed to a certain point,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
then it can no longer cope with
many of these other things.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And that extra stress is just
enough to put it over the edge.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So many of the problems we
face come down to one thing,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and that is monoculture.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
There are many attractions
to monoculture.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It's efficient.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But from the point of view
of nature, it's insane.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And monocultures are the reason
that the bees are struggling.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And monoculture is the
original sin of agriculture.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the trouble with
monoculture is it's an absolute

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
distortion of the way
an ecosystem works.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what you do
with a monoculture is

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
you take your vibrant
ecosystem, you destroy it,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.822 align:middle line:84%
and then you put in
place all the things

00:16:57.822 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
that you just took out.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having natural
fertilizers in the soil,

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:90%
you add inorganic fertilizers.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of allowing a natural
ecosystem around pests

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to develop, you have
to use pesticide.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
connection with bees?

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
As far as the industrial
agricultural corporations

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
are concerned, the solution
that's being offered

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
is to destroy the insects
that make food possible.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is the disaster that
they ready to force on us.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It used to be a continuous
paradise for honeybees from

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Pennsylvania all the way
through South Dakota.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The whole northern
part of the country.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But now there's just
huge, huge expanses

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of other just mono crops
of corn and soybeans.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.178 align:middle line:90%
The fence rows are all gone.

00:17:43.178 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The bees can't even
live there, and there's

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
not enough for the
bees to survive on

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%
in a continuous cornfield.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
They'll starve to death.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The German beekeepers and
our bees live in a very serious

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Every two years we
have a disaster.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
2002, 40% of the German
bee colonies died.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
2006, 50% of the bee
colonies in America died.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.925 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in the next years,
in these areas where

00:18:19.925 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the agriculture is so intensive
could bring us in a situation

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that the bees do not find enough
pollen and nectar in the area

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:90%
for sustain themselves.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We are in such a
habit of exploiting,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of using nature
for our own ends.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And the honeybees
right now I think

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.550 align:middle line:84%
are saying, if you continue
your ways, I'm withdrawing.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been a beekeeper
for over 30 years.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I knew something had to be
done to help the honeybees.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And here I was in my retirement.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
It was in this moment
of utter hopelessness,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I had that feeling of urgency
to start this biodynamic farm

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
with a bee sanctuary
at its heart.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Land had to be found.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
People had to be found
to come and help me.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And it was not easy.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You go on a great leap
of faith and trust.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I came to a moment
where I really

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
doubted that I could do
this alone with my wife.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point, things
more or less fell apart,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed like everything
I had worked for was gone.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Then the bees sort of
let me know, go ahead,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and we'll help you.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And a month later,
a wonderful donor

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
came for this purpose of
creating a honeybee sanctuary

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:90%
on the biodynamic farm.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It's 610 acres that
were maltreated

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:90%
like the rest of our land.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded here in
the heartland by Monsanto.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Farms that are-- a
lot of them already

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.345 align:middle line:84%
corporate-owned, and with
genetically manipulated seed.

00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
These are, for the
insect life, deserts,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
forage for the bees.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
They can't exist there.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we are
in this deep crisis

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
where we have to look at
the honeybee as a patient

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:90%
in the emergency room.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't demand of a
patient in the emergency room

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that they perform and give
you a lot of something.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
We are building up
here on Spikenard Farm

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:90%
a biodynamic farm for the bees.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We are enlivening the
soil and we are enlivening

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
all that is growing here.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And it rays out into
the surrounding area.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> From early humans on, we
were quite touched and impressed

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
by the way bees
can make honeycomb,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and by how exact
each cell is shaped.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:90%
They are all hexagonal.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The honeycomb is actually
part of their metabolic system.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
They sweat out the wax
between their abdominal rings.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
A honeycomb like this would
take approximately one million

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:90%
of those tiny platelets.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They build chains of building
bees, and they follow gravity.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly what happens
if you have a steel chain

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and you pin it in two sides.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:90%
You get such a form.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
groups of bees.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
One working here building this
part of the comb, another one

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:90%
working here building this part.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
they come close together.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The comb is the biggest
inner organ of the beehive.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It's their skeleton it's
the place they live on.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It is the womb for
all the baby bees.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the place where nectar
is processed into honey.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
90% of their life
span is happening

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:90%
on the comb in darkness.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What is amazing, wax is made
by bees that have never seen

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:90%
the light.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But they have been
nourished by light.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%

>> You take genes from
an unrelated species,

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and shoot it into
the cells of a plant.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are only two ways you
can introduce unrelated genes.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:84%
The first is the use
of a gene gun, where

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.710 align:middle line:84%
you shoot gold particles
laden with genes

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and put them into the organism.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
unreliable process,

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:84%
so you also have to add
antibiotic resistance markers.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:84%
You also have to
add viral promoters.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And every genetically
engineered seed

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is a bundle of bacteria,
toxins, viral promoters.

One German scientist found
that when bees collect pollen

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:84%
from corn, the genes that have
been inserted into the corn

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.260 align:middle line:84%
end up transferring into the
gut microorganisms of the bees

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and continue to function.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, human
beings also get

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:84%
genes transferred to
their gut bacteria,

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning it produces this
genetically engineered bacteria

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:90%
inside of us.

>> When we start to
manipulate genetic material,

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
we are going to the

But the question is, do we
have the wisdom, the morality,

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
the depth, to do
these interventions?

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Are we really knowing
what we are doing?

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Are we sure that what we do
will not have long-term effects?

>> I became a beekeeper in
2003 under rather unusual

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd been invited by the
local beekeeping association

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to give them a talk on genetic
engineering in relation

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to bees.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, why don't
you come and look at our bees?

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we opened some bee
hives, and that's what did it.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.105 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely smitten.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
challenges to beekeepers

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:84%
was the varroa mite, which has
now spread all over the United

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a little beast
that lives on the bee

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and drinks its blood.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And beekeepers have found that
unless they treat their bees

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals every
year, they will

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.790 align:middle line:90%
be killed by the varroa mite.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I was taught the conventional
way of beekeeping,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and did all the
things that my mentors

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.940 align:middle line:84%
taught me, which includes
putting chemicals in the hive.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals I started with
was a synthetic pyrethroid

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:90%
called Apistan.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, one doesn't want
that sort of thing in honey.

fit with my outlook.

In fact, if you get
the dosage wrong,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.665 align:middle line:84%
you get bee mortality from
the anti-varroa chemicals

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:45.390 align:middle line:90%
that you use.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You are on a kind of
treadmill of putting chemicals

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:90%
in the hives.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:56.640 align:middle line:84%

the bee adapts to the mite.

to kill the mites for so long,

we're breeding mites that adapt

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.980 align:middle line:84%
faster and faster to every
new chemical we throw at them.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.730 align:middle line:84%
This deadly chemical coumaphos
has no effect whatsoever

on the varroa mite.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the varroa mite
treated with the coumaphos

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.730 align:middle line:84%
did better by some measures than
mites that were not treated.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, a
chemical that was formerly

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
a deadly poison to them
is now somehow being

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:90%
used as a resource.

stronger and stronger.

Darwinian approach,

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I was nine when I
started beekeeping,

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and I learned it from
my stepfather, Ian.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.330 align:middle line:84%
When Phillip first
started, he actually

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.890 align:middle line:84%
pestered me into
keeping the bees.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He, at that point in time,
was the youngest beekeeper

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.940 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Bees have a sort
of weird intelligence,

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and they can do things that
humans can't, like walk upside

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.490 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.200 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
allure of Spider-Man,

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but sort of like the
bad bit of Scorpion.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You kind of feel a
little bit of emotion

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:01.450 align:middle line:84%
for the queens, who I have
named after various Queens

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:90%
of England.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of the names of the Queens
are Queen Elizabeth I, Mary,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.320 align:middle line:84%
who is named after Bloody
Mary, because she's

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.160 align:middle line:90%
one of the most vicious hives.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:84%
There's Queen Victoria, who
spawns almost all the time,

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.365 align:middle line:90%
but is fairly stable.

00:47:17.365 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> This is what is stress-free.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Day at work.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Stand up here.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Look at my girls.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.220 align:middle line:90%
You see this little antenna?

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:44.065 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:47:44.065 --> 00:47:46.640 align:middle line:90%


00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.220 align:middle line:90%
She's such a good girl.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Back you go.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Back you go.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at this.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:04.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is hackney in London.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.150 align:middle line:90%
This is what people can do.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
People say that they
can't keep bees.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.530 align:middle line:90%
They're lying.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And look at that side.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Dripping with honey.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:84%
All these girlies, yeah,
these girlies here,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.020 align:middle line:84%
are putting everything
back into the environment.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Not me.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm just helping them.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just think
it is so rewarding.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun lets life
be created on Earth.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Without the warmth, without the
light, no life would be here.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The bees themselves
are sun creatures,

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and the bees being
such great sun beings,

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:84%
they are the nurturers
of life on Earth.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The queen, the most sublime
being in such a hive,

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is deeply, deeply connected
with the sun forces.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:35.190 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:41.420 align:middle line:84%
When the young
queen emerges, when

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.810 align:middle line:84%
she goes on her marriage
flight, she flies up

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:48.110 align:middle line:90%
around 600 feet into the air.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:84%
She flies through
this swarm of drones,

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and is mated by up
to a dozen drones

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:05.010 align:middle line:84%
so that when she returns,
she has over a million sperm

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:05.810 align:middle line:90%
in her.

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And she can lay millions
of eggs over her lifespan.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And she can lay approximately
1,500 to 2,000 eggs a day,

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.190 align:middle line:84%
which is more weight-wise
than her own body weight.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous feat,
if you consider

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that she can lay more than her
own weight in eggs on one day.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a queen breeder.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.220 align:middle line:90%
I breed queen bees.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this so that I can
be a commercial beekeeper so I

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.560 align:middle line:90%
can make a living from bees.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those will have a
queen bee hatch out from it.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with bee breeding

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:84%
has always been this compromise
between inbreeding, which

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:84%
is a way of fixing
certain traits so

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that an entire line of
queens will all be similar,

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.890 align:middle line:84%
but if you push that
process too far,

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:14.700 align:middle line:84%
it ultimately weakens the bee
and you've lost the vigor.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And once you've lost vigor,
you've lost everything.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Modern queen breeding
has brought the quality

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.780 align:middle line:84%
of the queen down to a level
where the queens nowadays

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:90%
don't live four to five years.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes don't
live even one year.

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So they are susceptible
to all kinds of illnesses.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to re-queen
practically every year,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:84%
because the queens
don't last long.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with a cow.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.180 align:middle line:84%
The cow, instead
of living 20 years,

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:84%
has a life expectancy
of three to four years.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.985 align:middle line:90%
Not even one guaranteed calf.

00:51:57.985 --> 00:52:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There are parallels with bee
breeding and animal breeding.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.205 align:middle line:84%
Chickens' and pigs' genetic
stocks have been just weakened

00:52:09.205 --> 00:52:10.005 align:middle line:90%
terribly.

00:52:10.005 --> 00:52:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:14.310 align:middle line:90%
They have to be propped up.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, almost literally
propped up even

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:84%
to stand up so
that they can eat.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the direction
we're going in.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The biology of
honeybees is set up

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:84%
to avoid inbreeding
at all costs.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And if bees are
inbred for very long,

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.960 align:middle line:90%
they start to become weaker.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The artificial insemination
of queens is where a young

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:84%
queen, a virgin
queen is knocked out.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Sperm is squeezed
out of some drones,

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and the queen is
artificially inseminated.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The problem I see there
is that in nature,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the young queen goes
on a marriage flight,

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
the health of it,

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that the queen will
breed with up to a dozen

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.020 align:middle line:90%
drones of different varieties.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And here we are creating
another like a monoculture.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.290 align:middle line:90%
One stock.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And that stock is good
for a little while,

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and then it doesn't have the
life forces that is necessary.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beehive, we can
actually see what happens if we

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.270 align:middle line:90%
start to manipulate nature.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:90%
For a while, nothing much.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:84%
For 10, 20 years, it's
possible to do that.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But after 50, 60,
or 100 years, you

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.860 align:middle line:84%
can see the effects
of such manipulation

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:90%
very, very clearly.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that
in one of Rudolf Steiner's

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.570 align:middle line:84%
lectures, he
recognized very early

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.710 align:middle line:84%
on if we manipulate the bee
civilization on that level,

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:84%
there will be a
long-term effect.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are reaping the
harvest we have sown.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> This image of a queen in a
cage became a prominent image

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:90%
for me in the play.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And the queen represents for
me the soul of the world.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I was looking into this
metaphor of the queen

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.493 align:middle line:84%
in the cage, how bees were being
handled in the world today.

00:54:24.493 --> 00:54:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a queen
bee just there.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.040 align:middle line:90%
So we put her in a cage.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, the oldest one.

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And I can send her away
and sell her to somebody.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> All the queen bees in
cages are being exported

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to the United States to build
up the colonies in the States.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:51.415 align:middle line:84%
This has degenerated the whole
strength of the bee colony.

00:54:51.415 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to raise queens
again the natural way.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And this we have to
respect that nature

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.530 align:middle line:90%
is much wiser than we are.

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:18.910 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We live with our bees
in the bush and the forest.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We moved with them, and
you do become very in tune

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.830 align:middle line:84%
with nature when you live
with them all the time.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And they have got some
magical, magical properties,

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.380 align:middle line:90%
and magical things they do.

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I think some of
it rubs off on us.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my father
was a beekeeper,

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and his grandfather had a
bit of a fiddle before him.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So I started sort of getting
stung at a pretty early age.

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Building on the lids for the
hives there in the back yard,

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:52.980 align:middle line:90%
with my mum.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.522 align:middle line:84%
I remember mum
tailing me, running up

00:55:54.522 --> 00:55:57.330 align:middle line:84%
the house screaming with
her head full of angry bees

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.730 align:middle line:90%
stinging the hell out of you.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Easy, you just slap a
handful off like that.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's get some smoke
going pretty quick.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Just push it down in there a bit
till it gets a little bit going

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and a bit of a puff.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Smell, smell the honey.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit odd today.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
trouble in Australia

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
yet with the colony
collapse disorder

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to be
having in America.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.742 align:middle line:84%
So I think you just create
such a big toxic load

00:56:25.742 --> 00:56:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that the bees have
had enough, flew away,

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:32.370 align:middle line:84%
out the door they go and go
look for greener pastures.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In Western Australia,
the use of chemicals

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:41.220 align:middle line:84%
is banned for the treatment of
hive diseases and parasites.

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:44.220 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence, our
honey it's quite pristine

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:84%
compared to other
parts of the world who

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.680 align:middle line:84%
have to treat with miticides
et cetera, which must in

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.200 align:middle line:84%
turn leach into the honey
and give you a contaminated

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.710 align:middle line:90%
product.

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a bit of fresh
West Australian nectar,

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:84%
after one day, and
it's beautiful.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, sweet,
light flavored honey.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Excellent for
toast and crumpets.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, just eat that all day.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In New Zealand, we have
this fantastic history

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of beekeeping, because it's
very much part of a farming

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.540 align:middle line:84%
community that involves
beekeepers and farmers working

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:43.110 align:middle line:84%
together to have a whole
agricultural system that works.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The feeling for nature,
and for the bees, and that

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.820 align:middle line:84%
has become very much connected
to my Maori connection.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:58.290 align:middle line:84%
In old societies, the beekeeper
was a very respected person.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He became someone
that was revered,

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and someone that
was looked up to who

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:06.000 align:middle line:90%
would bring in this sweetness.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Maori were very
much a people that

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.110 align:middle line:84%
would watch nature
and watch insects,

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and if they would
see changes in them,

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:84%
these changes would
mean a lot to them.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And that would mean that
there would be changes

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.150 align:middle line:90%
coming for them as well.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:26.980 align:middle line:84%
We're hearing stories
from America of bees

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.690 align:middle line:90%
not coming back to their colony.

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And for me to think that my
children won't have pollination

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:36.130 align:middle line:84%
happening with their berries,
and with their vegetable

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:44.400 align:middle line:84%
patches and food supply, I find
that really something that's

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:47.110 align:middle line:90%
really affecting my heart.

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
finding out why I'm

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:54.350 align:middle line:84%
beekeeping is to keep that going
for my children's children.

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>> If bees leave this
world, I wouldn't like it,

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:04.936 align:middle line:84%
because there would be
no honey and no fruit.

00:59:04.936 --> 00:59:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you wouldn't find any
peaches or apples these days

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.710 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My three daughters and
my wife are now coming out

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:84%
into the field with me, and
that's an incredibly warming

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.325 align:middle line:84%
feeling around the bees, is
to have a family business.

00:59:21.325 --> 00:59:24.450 align:middle line:90%


00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful that
the kids can be

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:29.940 align:middle line:84%
part of the financial
business-making,

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and roll candles
for the girls to be

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:35.640 align:middle line:90%
able to sell at the market.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> All the wax that we make,
it helps us make get some money

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to look after our ponies,
which are very special to us,

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and we really like doing that.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is Lay.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.430 align:middle line:84%
She's 30 years old,
and she loves honey.

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:49.230 align:middle line:90%
She's great.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:51.000 align:middle line:84%
She goes out and
wins competitions,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.480 align:middle line:90%
and she's healthy.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.430 align:middle line:90%
She's a good pony.

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And still looking young.

00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we had a pony that had
an electric fence that pulled

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:06.350 align:middle line:84%
all his skin down, so we had
to pull it up like a sock,

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.510 align:middle line:84%
bandage it with manuka
honey every day,

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:12.230 align:middle line:84%
fresh manuka honey on every day,
and the whole thing has healed

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:13.030 align:middle line:90%
completely.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And vets can't believe it.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:21.000 align:middle line:90%


01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm stung.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm stung.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%


01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's pumping the
toxin into my flesh.

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.033 align:middle line:90%
You can see it moving.

01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just give
you a demonstration how

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.700 align:middle line:90%
to get them out.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So you'll just bend your
fingernail back like that,

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and go--

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.670 align:middle line:90%
cut it off.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The venom from the bee sting is
the same as rattlesnake poison.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you-- the
only thing is it's

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.110 align:middle line:90%
only a little minute amount.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Rattlesnake bite can
kill you, but, well,

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
if you got enough bee stings,
it would kill you too.

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Beekeeper, he can
receive 500 stings.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.740 align:middle line:90%
But more than 500, he can die.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be in very
deep respect about bee.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.120 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:22.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.665 align:middle line:84%
To be a beekeeper
is a kind of art.

01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:29.990 align:middle line:90%


01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
If you are a yogi,
if you practice yoga,

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
naturally you can
be a beekeeper,

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.540 align:middle line:90%
because you have to be quiet.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
You have to explore your soul.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Bees, life and death.

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What's particularly
unfortunate is that honeybees

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
are often blamed for stings
that are inflicted by other

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Hymenopterans.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
To an entomologist, a
yellow jacket is a wasp.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It looks nothing like a bee.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Bees are sort of
brownish and fuzzy.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Yellow jackets are yellow
and black and shiny.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Different behavior,
different gestalt,

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
but the vast majority of
non-entomologists, people

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
are either unwilling to or
unable to differentiate.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So bees get a lot of bad
press that is undeserved.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.692 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you clip this
little branch there first?

01:02:26.692 --> 01:02:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> This one right here?

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's about to go.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.916 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oops.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> A swarm, as much as
people don't like it,

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
is a natural way of procreation,
of guaranteeing that more

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:50.360 align:middle line:90%
colonies of bees are there.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the right time when the
new queens are ready to emerge,

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the old queen, with almost
half of the entire workers,

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
will leave the hive.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They swirl around in the
circumference of maybe 50 feet.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the queen
lands and alights

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
on maybe a branch, and the
rest of those swarm bees

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.390 align:middle line:90%
gather in a cluster.

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And they hang there
until they are either

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
taken by the beekeeper
or they find a new home.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.070 align:middle line:90%


01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So the commercial
or the average hobby

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.590 align:middle line:90%
beekeeper prevent swarming.

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have taken that
joy, that joie de vivre,

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that wonderful invigorating
activity away from them.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
For the honeybee to
regain her health,

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I think we also have to see
that the swarming is allowed

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.920 align:middle line:90%
again as much as possible.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:06.800 align:middle line:90%


01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> When somebody calls, and
I'm on lists all over the place

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
for swarms--

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:12.470 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is great--

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually go to the hives
where people are freaked out

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and they're afraid.

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
That to me is like,
uh-oh, hive in danger.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:23.425 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people call
an exterminator.

01:04:23.425 --> 01:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
They really think that the
bees are going to attack

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:27.310 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They're at their most
docile at that time.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Exterminators come
and they poison them.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I tell people that you're
seeing a miracle of nature.

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a force of nature
come and landed on your tree.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Bee hive is just simply
moving to a new home.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.910 align:middle line:90%


01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The woman I was helping,
she had just taken my class,

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't have
any bees before.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And often I say get a swarm.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy bees.

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:56.660 align:middle line:90%
That's commercial.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.810 align:middle line:90%
That's cattle ranching bees.

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I invite them to come
with me on a swarm call,

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and I help people get set
up with their first hive.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:06.680 align:middle line:90%
It's so wonderful.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.212 align:middle line:84%
Then they get to
handle the bees,

01:05:08.212 --> 01:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
and they get to be with them.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.355 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just sticking them in
a box and letting them grow.

01:05:12.355 --> 01:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So they get to
interact with them

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:15.424 align:middle line:90%
right from the very beginning.

01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%


01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You could see how
happy she was, and she

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.440 align:middle line:90%
started singing with the bees.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
She was feeling into them,
and she'll be a good bee mama.

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't express it.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- I'm
like a little kid.

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like I got my first bicycle
or something, I don't know.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so excited to work
with them, and learn with them,

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
and yeah.

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:52.212 align:middle line:90%


01:05:52.212 --> 01:05:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I wonder if bees paint.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And if they do, how?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Wisteria, and
I'm a backyard beekeeper

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
in Portland, Oregon.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And we are building beehives
and painting bee boxes.

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I've got my friends and family
and members of the Bee Project

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.840 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
We're tasting mead.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is delicious.

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It has a little bit
of a sparkle to it.

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And just sharing with
families from Portland what

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.150 align:middle line:90%
beekeeping is all about.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%


01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a rooftop beekeeper
in New York City.

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a third
generation beekeeper.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.470 align:middle line:90%
It's illegal here to keep bees.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:47.090 align:middle line:90%


01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It kind of scares me.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It worries me a little bit.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.360 align:middle line:90%


01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I really would like
to keep my bees.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.875 align:middle line:84%
We're really just trying to do
something simple for nature.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:06.080 align:middle line:90%


01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
crazy moment here.

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
As we're doing this,
there's a swarm of bees.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They look like they're
going into that tree

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
right there, which is not--
it's just completely bizarre.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure where
they came from,

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.335 align:middle line:90%
and they're coming closer.

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It does look like there they are
sort of aiming right in there.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they totally are.

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's crazy.

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:26.503 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never quite
seen this happening.

01:07:26.503 --> 01:07:30.670 align:middle line:90%


01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you guys brought
that mojo, honestly.

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.482 align:middle line:84%
Only in the Bronx, baby, are
you going to find a swarm.

01:07:36.482 --> 01:07:42.748 align:middle line:90%


01:07:42.748 --> 01:07:44.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Legalize beekeeping.

01:07:44.885 --> 01:07:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Give the bees a chance.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.835 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

01:07:49.835 --> 01:07:50.825 align:middle line:90%


01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> All we are saying
is give bees a chance.

01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Legalize beekeeping.

01:08:00.724 --> 01:08:02.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Give the bees a chance.

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:06.340 align:middle line:90%


01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Beekeeping, the vital
practice of managing

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining honeybee
colonies for pollination

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and honey production, is a
banned practice in New York

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.260 align:middle line:90%
City.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.569 align:middle line:84%
This ban is outdated
and detrimental

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
to the health and well-being
of our urban environment

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.410 align:middle line:90%
and our community.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
This bill needs
our support, and I

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.240 align:middle line:84%
encourage you to call your city
council representative today

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and encourage them to support
Councilman Yassky's bill.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my neighbors, probably
because they were uninformed

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and scared maybe, reported the
hive to the health department.

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I was served
with a notice of violation,

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and I have to appear at
a hearing in 15 minutes.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.859 align:middle line:84%
>> If she has a child, and
sees, as she pointed out,

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.180 align:middle line:90%
this swarm of bees--

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If beekeeping is done
properly, it's a safe activity.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
This solves both problems.

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Lets people who want
to do it, do it,

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.939 align:middle line:84%
and makes sure
that those who are

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
going to engage in this
beekeeping do it safely.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we have a wonderful
opportunity to do what other

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.590 align:middle line:90%
great cities have done.

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Legalize bees, allow
for honey production,

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.819 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on a tiny
rooftop or a small garden,

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and build the sustainability
movement bee by bee.

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:27.410 align:middle line:90%


01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:28.479 align:middle line:90%
>> --honey festival.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
There will be tastings, and
jugglers, and demonstrations,

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.883 align:middle line:84%
so you should definitely come
and pick up your local honey

01:09:35.883 --> 01:09:37.362 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:09:37.362 --> 01:09:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And all the restaurants
across New York City

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.785 align:middle line:84%
are participating
in New York Nectar.

01:09:42.785 --> 01:09:54.140 align:middle line:90%


01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm a beekeeper here
at the Center for Discovery.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I just had this sense that I
had this calling to do service.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.690 align:middle line:90%
So I'm at home.

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm in heaven here.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.710 align:middle line:90%


01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the most amazing
things about the farm

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
is that we're working with
people with disabilities.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.672 align:middle line:84%
But by working with them
and integrating them

01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
into our farm-raised
program, they really

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.370 align:middle line:84%
become individuals
with abilities.

01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:26.121 align:middle line:90%


01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Nice work.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
People with autism have this
innate affinity for nature.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And so by working outside,
they're just-- they're at home.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.920 align:middle line:90%


01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I think about
colony collapse disorder,

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I really hope that
we can, as a society,

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
have a connection
with nature instead

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.190 align:middle line:90%
of a disconnect with nature.

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
really enjoy about the bees

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
is that they all have this
really strong sense of mission.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
individual advantage.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not about getting ahead.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.310 align:middle line:90%
They take on different tasks.

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Like they might start off
as a housekeeper, and then

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.930 align:middle line:90%
a nurse bee.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Much like we have
different roles here.

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We have integration specialists,
and skills trainers.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.880 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of people
coming together as a team

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to provide a really
rich and meaningful life

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
for our residents here.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to create
a family for them

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and to build a community that
they can really thrive in,

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and where they can find
their own niche to really

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
be the individual
that they really are.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:41.310 align:middle line:90%


01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
If you take a single
bee out of a hive,

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
it actually can't
live on its own.

01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It's biologically
dependent upon community.

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:53.343 align:middle line:84%
And even though some humans
can survive on their own,

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:55.385 align:middle line:84%
the individuals that we
take care of here cannot.

01:11:55.385 --> 01:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%


01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They really are dependent upon
a team of people coming together

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to be of service to them, and
coming together in all humility

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
just like the bees do when they
take on their individual roles

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
in their particular
stage of life.

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:24.580 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to care for
nature in the right way,

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and nature will
care for us in turn.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So community is not
just a human problem.

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a global problem.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Community with one
another and nature.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So human community is the
perfect training ground

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
for community with the
planet, with nature.

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We keep bees
because we love them.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And we love them because
they need our help now.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to
take care of them.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the beekeeper's job
is to see that the bees stay

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
happy and healthy.

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:05.530 align:middle line:90%


01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We now have three colonies
of bees in that garden.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
The children are absolutely
relaxed in their presence.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of bees there.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.505 align:middle line:84%
>> They're aware of the
problems of the honeybee.

01:13:17.505 --> 01:13:20.060 align:middle line:90%


01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So bees belong to be
all over the world.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And the great problem
now is they are not,

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
because we're creating
places where they can't live.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're doing what
we're doing here in the garden.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to show
you young people

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:39.066 align:middle line:90%
how to put bees everywhere.

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%


01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Colony collapse,
I've experienced it.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm an organic beekeeper
with the best of intentions.

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I've gone to some
hives, and they're gone.

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.130 align:middle line:90%
The problems are here.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
They're everybody's
problem now, and we all

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.990 align:middle line:90%
suffer the consequences of that.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%


01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Commercial beekeepers cannot
stop and reverse direction

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.340 align:middle line:90%
without risking bankruptcy.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And an alternative to rolling
on the interstates 20,000 miles

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
a year would be to go to the
various monoculture productions

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:23.743 align:middle line:84%
and simply tell them the
writing is on the wall.

01:14:23.743 --> 01:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
One of these
springs, you're going

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
to call for
migratory beekeepers,

01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and they won't be there for you,
and you'll be out of business.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you take a small
portion of your holdings,

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and plow it under and plant
it with bee-friendly crops

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to sustain those
creatures all year long,

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
not just for three
weeks in the spring?

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.340 align:middle line:90%


01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.860 align:middle line:84%
That way, you will know
what your situation

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is, because they'll be there
right on your property.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%


01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.385 align:middle line:84%
>> The honeybee
belongs on every farm.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Turning this crisis around
is not going to be easy,

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
and it won't happen overnight.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Bees are telling us to
become true caretakers,

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and the only
solution is creating

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.356 align:middle line:84%
a surrounding of wildflowers,
and forage, and diversity.

01:15:38.356 --> 01:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%


01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Spikenard farm has been
not only a challenge,

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
but the variety of tasks for me
is just at times overwhelming.

01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%


01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't manage
everything alone.

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:02.480 align:middle line:90%


01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And the help from other
human beings and other beings

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.630 align:middle line:90%
has to come in.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%


01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Even in two years now, a much
greater variety of insects

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.180 align:middle line:90%
are coming back.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very deeply satisfying.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And honeybee sanctuaries
are springing up

01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:24.360 align:middle line:90%
like mushrooms in this country.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:31.620 align:middle line:90%


01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
People have asked me why do
you do what you're doing?

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you have hope with
all the mess we are in,

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:40.800 align:middle line:90%
with all we are doing in nature?

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would say I would have
hope to the very last day,

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.595 align:middle line:90%
to the last plant.

01:16:46.595 --> 01:16:53.350 align:middle line:90%


01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The bees are the most
exquisite beings.

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They show us what this
service can be like.

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Queen of the sun.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.118 align:middle line:90%
Queen of the hive.

01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Her love alone keeps us alive.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Queen of the hive.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Queen of the sun.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Brings love and
light for everyone.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Queen of the sun.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Queen of the hive.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:52.241 align:middle line:90%
Her love keeps us alive.

01:18:57.211 --> 01:19:00.193 align:middle line:90%
Her love keeps us alive.

There is magic in the honeycomb.

01:19:13.612 --> 01:19:18.085 align:middle line:90%
There is magic in the honeycomb.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It starts with a seed,
and then becomes a flower.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Along comes a bee and
they dance for hours.

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.015 align:middle line:84%
There's mystery in between,
in things we've never felt

01:19:36.015 --> 01:19:38.896 align:middle line:90%
or seen, but we are learning.

01:19:44.385 --> 01:19:50.373 align:middle line:84%
That's why the bees, that's
why the bees, that's why

01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:54.365 align:middle line:90%
the bees dream sweet nectar.

01:19:54.365 --> 01:19:59.854 align:middle line:84%
That's why the bees, that's

I feel like a bee, searching
for something sweet.

I'm finding just a little
bit in everyone I meet.

There's perfect orchestration in
this crazy, crazy, crazy world.

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And I am learning.

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:36.770 align:middle line:90%

the bees dream sweet nectar.

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:55.790 align:middle line:90%
the bees dream sweet nectar.

01:20:55.790 --> 01:21:00.540 align:middle line:84%
They work all together
in symmetrical bliss.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:05.412 align:middle line:84%
There's something we humans
can surely learn from this.

01:21:05.412 --> 01:21:07.348 align:middle line:90%
And they're home.

01:21:07.348 --> 01:21:12.188 align:middle line:84%
And they're building sweet
honeycomb, and they drone.

01:21:12.188 --> 01:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And they build the sweet
as the comb in there.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Follow the bees and
find our way home.
