00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:90%
So I call his pediatrician.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.684 align:middle line:84%

00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Finally got us a room.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Got an X-ray.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.579 align:middle line:84%
They found pneumonia
in his right lung.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Figured that was what
we were dealing with.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.661 align:middle line:84%
So I called Christy and told
her we're in the hospital.

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:23.852 align:middle line:90%
He's got pneumonia.

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:90%
She's trying to calm me down.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Told me not to worry about it.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
You know, kids get pneumonia.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They'll be fine.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
He'll probably stay in the
hospital for a day or two.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
All night long he just kept
getting worse and worse.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
His temperature would
get pretty high.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Or, at least his body
temperature was high.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But his oral temperature was
never really spiking real high.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
He started hallucinating around
4:00, 5:00 in the morning.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I--

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.533 align:middle line:84%
I went to help him
go to the bathroom.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we stood him up,
his front was really clammy.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And his back would
almost burn your hands.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And I told the nurse that.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
So she came in.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And they had to do a
rectal temperature.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And his internal temperature
at that point was 105.9.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:84%
She called in the
critical care team.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
His pediatrician showed up, who
made the call that he needed

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
to be at a pediatric hospital.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.535 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm still
thinking pneumonia.

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So I told Jesse I was
going run to the house,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
get him some clean
clothes, get him his games.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be down
there to Vanderbilt.

>> Where that gets really
challenging for us as providers

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:10%
is that when we see patients
who have cough, and fever,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:10%
and are missing school
or missing work,

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:10%

intervene to be able to cut

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.792 align:middle line:10%
those symptoms short and
get people back to health.

Since we don't have good
therapies for viruses,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
we tend to focus a lot on
those bacterial infections

that we do have antibiotics for.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that for
every patient that we treat

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
with antibiotics we're breeding
a certain sense of resistance

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in the community, that's fine
for infections that absolutely

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:90%
require antibiotics.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But where we really
get into trouble

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is that we prescribe antibiotics
for maybe five people.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.929 align:middle line:84%
Maybe only two or three of
them actually need antibiotics.

00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And only two or three of them
will those antibiotics actually

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
make them better faster.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And we need things like
rapid diagnostic tests.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So when this patient is
in my office, I run a test

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:90%
and a printout comes out.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And it says, oh, this
patient has a virus.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Now I have no more fear.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%

explaining to the patient

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:90%

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had her actually
listened to his breathing.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of like
[BREATHES IN AND OUT]..

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And she said, hang up the phone.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Call 911 immediately.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the two men
from the ambulance

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:84%
came up to our apartment, they
did another series of tests.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
They said, he's fine.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
felt kind of embarrassed.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh my gosh, I exaggerated.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm making much
ado about nothing.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:90%
We can go home now.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But then the medical technician
said, no, because of protocol.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.814 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in the ambulance,
we have to take you

00:41:17.814 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:90%
to the emergency room.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So we went to the
emergency room.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly I had a
flood of health care people

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:90%
surrounding me and Simon.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:10%
And they kept repeating your
child is very, very sick.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Your child is very, very sick.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.547 align:middle line:90%
And I was just breaking down.

00:41:33.547 --> 00:41:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
asking me questions

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
like has Simon been to
another country recently?

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Has he been to a farm recently?

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Has he had all
his immunizations?

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.695 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
well, we have to take him

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to the intensive care unit.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, finally, when I was
allowed in, Simon was in a bed

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:10%
with all kinds of
tubes connected to him.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.860 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.040 align:middle line:90%
He was intubated.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor, the
attending explained

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that he's having a lot
of trouble breathing.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the only
thing that we know

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is that your son
has an infection.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's very, very,
very, very sick.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So you need to plan to
be here for a long time.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought us into
where he was lying down in bed.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were at least
10 medical doctors.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the only
chance that he would have was

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.740 align:middle line:84%
if they put him on this machine
called the ECMO machine,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.316 align:middle line:84%
E-C-M-O. It's a
heart-lung machine.

00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we
said, OK, let's

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:90%
bring him to this machine.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was very, very
difficult to see this

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
because they had to elevate him
so that the machine would work

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
better for gravity reasons.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And my husband stayed by
his side the whole night.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.250 align:middle line:90%
He was on a stepladder.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was stroking
his hair, telling him

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:84%
about all the things that
they would do together

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.230 align:middle line:84%
like fishing, skiing,
all the things

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that my husband wanted
to do with Simon.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of night,
I was just so beside myself.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I really felt like that
Simon had already died.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt like
I needed to go back home

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to where my daughter was so I
could spend some time with her.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back at
6:00, 7:00 in the morning.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the doctor
said that there was really

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.760 align:middle line:84%
no chance that Simon
was going to make it.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
my son was completely

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:90%
transformed physically.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:90%
He was completely bloated.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:84%
He had purple splotches
all over his body.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
He had purple tears
coming out of his eyes.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean he looked totally like
a different being altogether.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we agreed to take him
off this ECMO machine.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
was pronounced dead.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:90%
That was April 17th, a Saturday.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was just
completely stunned.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:90%
No one knew why he had died.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And we had to live with
that for about two months

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.994 align:middle line:84%
when we were waiting
for the autopsy results.

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we were called in.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were told that
Simon had contracted

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:84%
this antibiotic
resistant bacterium.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was a new strain.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a community
associated strain,

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.020 align:middle line:84%
not a health care
associated strain.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was a strain of
MRSA staph, specifically

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:84%
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when the
doctors had given him

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:84%
a broad spectrum of
antibiotics before he died,

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:90%
nothing was working.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And what is so frustrating even
to this day nine years later,

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:84%
we have absolutely
no idea how Simon

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:90%
contracted this bacterium.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't know even where.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It happened in
less than 24 hours.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Really don't even have words
to describe how we felt

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.890 align:middle line:90%
after learning all of this.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:27.348 align:middle line:90%

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 70s, the FDA
expressed serious concern about

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.520 align:middle line:90%
antibiotic resistance on farms.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But by that time, the
practice was so entrenched.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the interests
involved were getting

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
so big and powerful that
the genie was already

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:90%
out of the bottle.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.820 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, the Food and Drug
Administration said that unless

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
drug companies can
prove their safety,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the number of antibiotics used
in poultry feed will be banned

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:90%
as of next year.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a similar
ban on food for hog, sheep,

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.860 align:middle line:90%
and cattle by mid '73.

>> When something that is
approved by the FDA is not

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.810 align:middle line:10%
shown to be safe
for human health,

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:10%
FDA has to stop the
approval for that drug.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We're creating resistant
organisms that may ultimately

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.380 align:middle line:84%
transfer that resistance to
organisms that cause human

disease.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.535 align:middle line:84%
>> But do you think the use
of animal feeds constitutes

00:46:38.535 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
the sort of health hazard
where there could be a severe

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:41.710 align:middle line:90%
epidemic?

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

made those findings,

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.490 align:middle line:90%

years, actions stalled.

And there continues to remain
gaps in the understanding.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think that has driven
the inability to kind of move

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.964 align:middle line:10%
forward is that those gaps
over the numbers of years

00:47:17.964 --> 00:47:19.130 align:middle line:10%
have always been pointed to.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And say, well, we don't
have definitive enough data.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, we
shouldn't take any action.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
been the thinking up

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.010 align:middle line:84%
until more recently
where I think

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:32.960 align:middle line:84%
we've been pushing for moving
forward with a strategy that

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.722 align:middle line:84%
says, well look,
we understand there

00:47:34.722 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:90%
are some gaps in the science.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
awful lot we do know.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>> We've tracked for decades
now outbreaks associated with

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:45.240 align:middle line:10%
particular types of food animal
groups and with products from

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.040 align:middle line:10%
food animals.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:10%
And if resistant bacteria
are causing those infections,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:10%
then we've got to think about
where the pressures were

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:57.615 align:middle line:10%
exerted on those bacteria to,
number one, develop resistance,

00:47:57.615 --> 00:47:59.490 align:middle line:10%
and to, number two, get
into the food supply.

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:06.480 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> This is not just
a theoretical risk.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:10%
What we see is that most of our
meat and poultry in the United

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.930 align:middle line:10%
States are contaminated with
drug-resistant bacteria.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:10%
So just for example, if
you go to the grocery store

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and you want to buy some ground
turkey, you have about a one

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:10%
in 300 chance of finding a
tube of the ground turkey

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.740 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't have
drug-resistant bacteria in it.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But this year something
came out that really

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
grabbed my attention.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So this year we saw one
package of ground turkey

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:84%
had a salmonella strain in it
that was resistant to all eight

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:36.890 align:middle line:90%
drugs that were tested.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So we may be looking at
pan-resistant salmonella.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So most salmonella
infections are self-limiting.

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
You're uncomfortable
for a while.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:48.450 align:middle line:84%
You use a lot of toilet paper,
right, but you usually survive.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But when this is pan-resistant,
if your immune system cannot

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:84%
take care of it, you're very
likely to die of this, right?

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's because your physician
doesn't have any other options

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.768 align:middle line:90%
to treat you with this.

00:49:00.768 --> 00:49:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In response, FDA has chosen
to focus on voluntary measures,

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:13.500 align:middle line:84%
essentially recommendations to
industry that industry is free

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to follow or ignore.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%

in a collaborative way with

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:84%
the industry and in a
co-operative way so that we can

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:84%
move forward in a productive
way to get this issue addressed,

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:84%
but at same time make sure that
these products continue to be

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.580 align:middle line:84%
available to the
animal ag community.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And that we make the change
in a real deliberate way,

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us some ability
to phase it in over time

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to what
those collateral effects may

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:84%
be as we move forward
implementing the changes.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Over and over we see the
influence of money in politics.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know what it really
comes down to, I think,

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is that when these
industries consolidate

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
of the industry

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.030 align:middle line:84%
gets tied up into
fewer and fewer hands.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:90%
You get these massive companies.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
They make massive
amounts of profits,

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and they invest some of those
profits in their lobbying

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.300 align:middle line:90%
effort.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea there was is that
if these two antibiotic could be

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.570 align:middle line:84%
limited, then their usefulness
in veterinary therapy

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and in human therapy
would be preserved.

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Feedlot operators
fought that ban and won.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:84%
They argued, no
conclusive link has

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:84%
been established
between antibiotic use

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.600 align:middle line:90%
in animals and human disease.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But the government says
that's no longer true.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It isn't just the meat
companies who have massive

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:40.920 align:middle line:90%
amounts of power.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the animal
pharmaceutical companies

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.854 align:middle line:84%
that make lots and lots of
money selling the stuff.

00:50:45.854 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:90%
They have a vested interest.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
The fast food industry-- they
don't really care how it gets

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.310 align:middle line:90%
made.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They just want to be able to
offer their triple cheeseburger

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.150 align:middle line:84%
or their meat lover's
pizza at a price that

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.770 align:middle line:90%
keeps consumers coming back.

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They're against these
kinds of measures.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you get these powerful
economic interests lined up

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.870 align:middle line:84%
with lobbying
power, and it really

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:06.440 align:middle line:84%
isn't that big of
a mystery why we

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:90%
haven't seen very much change.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But now that we know
the extent of the problem,

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.890 align:middle line:84%
let us consider what
can be done about it.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it a necessary evil?

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it something science
is unable to fight,

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.590 align:middle line:84%
or is it simply too powerful
for the human race to cope with?

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Denmark.

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, I
went back for a visit.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed at their progress,
and I took some home movies.

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.090 align:middle line:10%
You can see for yourself how
Denmark attacks the problem.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1992, Denmark made an
agreement with the English

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.910 align:middle line:10%
people.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:10.030 align:middle line:10%
They don't want antibiotic
growth promoters

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.530 align:middle line:10%
in the food for the pigs.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:16.930 align:middle line:10%
And in 1995, it was
banned in Denmark

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:10%
that you may not use antibiotic
growth promoters for food.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:10%
In 1998, it was
banned in Europe,

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.260 align:middle line:10%
but I think it was
2004 it was stopped

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:33.070 align:middle line:10%
the use antibiotic growth
promoters totally in Europe.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:43.840 align:middle line:10%
But in Denmark we
started already in 1992.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.201 align:middle line:10%
>> 200 females and
no one is screaming.

00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:49.950 align:middle line:10%
>> As soon as we started
looking after it,

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.866 align:middle line:10%
we could see that this
resistance was all over

00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:53.970 align:middle line:10%
the place in our food animals.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.610 align:middle line:10%
It was in our food products,
and it was actually also

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.490 align:middle line:10%
in healthy humans in the
community in Denmark,

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:10%
even though there was
extremely limited amount of use

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.160 align:middle line:10%
on the human side at that time.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:10.710 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a public debate on
whether this was a human health

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:16.200 align:middle line:10%
risk that we used these
antibiotic growth promoters.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:22.590 align:middle line:10%
And finally, the industry
decided that we could probably

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:10%
still have a
profitable production

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.980 align:middle line:10%
without using the
antibiotic growth promoters.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.180 align:middle line:10%
So in order to, you
could say, accommodate

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:39.000 align:middle line:10%
the public and our
customers, we decided that we

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:10%
would ban them voluntarily.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.100 align:middle line:10%
It's an industry initiative.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.430 align:middle line:10%
It was not the government.

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.730 align:middle line:10%
Later on, the EU banned
antibiotic growth promoters,

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:50.110 align:middle line:10%
but that was seven years later.

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:54.420 align:middle line:10%
So it was simply because of a
discussion in the public about

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:10%
whether this was a problem.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the question is, does
their system work any better?

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:11.690 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The bottom line is that today
we in total use approximately

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:10%
half the amount of antimicrobial
agents as we did before

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:24.380 align:middle line:10%
the ban, and we
produce 50% more.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, resistance
has gone down really heavily.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I will not say
I love that ban,

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.800 align:middle line:10%
but the result coming out
of the ban I love that.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.055 align:middle line:10%
I'm not organic
producer, but I love not

00:54:40.055 --> 00:54:43.010 align:middle line:10%
to give more than necessary.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.610 align:middle line:10%
>> You have to balance out
what are the costs and what are

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.410 align:middle line:10%
the benefits.

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:50.990 align:middle line:10%
AGPs, when we
stopped using them,

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:56.540 align:middle line:10%
we could see that mortality
went up just a little bit,

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:10%
daily growth went down
just a little bit,

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:04.280 align:middle line:10%
but it was not something that
was the end of the industry.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.420 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be here today.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.230 align:middle line:10%
And, I mean, we
produce more pigs today

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:14.150 align:middle line:10%
than we did 12 years
ago, way more pigs.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:20.234 align:middle line:90%


00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, of course, we hear this
argument all the time that this

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:10%
might be feasible to do
something in a small country

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.470 align:middle line:10%
like Denmark.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:27.340 align:middle line:10%
But come on.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.950 align:middle line:10%
Denmark is producing 28
million pigs every year.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:34.930 align:middle line:10%
That's basically the same amount
as the state of Iowa does.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.081 align:middle line:10%
I think it's about
30 million pigs.

00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:38.830 align:middle line:10%
So if we could do it
in Denmark, of course

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:39.775 align:middle line:10%
you could do it in Iowa.

00:55:39.775 --> 00:55:41.440 align:middle line:10%
And Iowa's probably
the state in the US

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.270 align:middle line:10%
that's producing most pigs.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.540 align:middle line:10%
So it's not so difficult.
It is actually feasible,

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:50.975 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, you can scale
it up to any state in the US.

00:55:50.975 --> 00:56:00.675 align:middle line:90%

research to look

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just say, you have
to tell us how much you use?

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.386 align:middle line:90%
There has to be an accounting.

00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:37.250 align:middle line:90%

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:50.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not entirely clear to
me how that would happen.

But the folks that--

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:59.732 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure this is
really something that will--

00:58:59.732 --> 00:59:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it's not my area of
expertise per se as

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.050 align:middle line:90%
far as gathering all this data.

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:06.950 align:middle line:84%

other organizations,
Premier Health,

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that are sources of
this type of data.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And through contracts
with them, they

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.920 align:middle line:84%
can provide different types
of data on anti-bacterial drug

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
at one or two diseases at a time
but is doing pan surveillance,

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I think those are real policy
questions that need to be

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.929 align:middle line:90%
addressed.

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:10%

data to show where you are,

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.707 align:middle line:10%
you have absolutely no
clue where you're going.

01:00:16.707 --> 01:00:19.290 align:middle line:10%
You cannot monitor what is the
effect of the interventions you

You don't know which kind of--

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.090 align:middle line:10%
what you should target,
what you should do about it.

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%

independent FDA and USDA,

products to analyze them

elsewhere, but that

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.760 align:middle line:10%
If 148,000 people die a year
of uncontrollable infections,

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.830 align:middle line:10%
we've got a problem
on our hands,

particularly since a decade
or two ago that wouldn't

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
have been a problem at all.

And it is up to us to stop it.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.340 align:middle line:90%

not to say stupid--

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that we would take one of
the most single advances

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
in medicine in our lifetime
or in this last century

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.560 align:middle line:90%
and simply waste it.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.880 align:middle line:90%

appropriate to be concerned.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
There aren't nearly enough
drugs coming forward.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:12.130 align:middle line:90%


01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're a pharma company
and you spend 10 years

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and a billion dollars--

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
those are the usually
agreed to numbers--

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
10 years and a billion
dollars developing a drug,

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and you bring that drug
out and within a year

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
bacteria are resistant to it.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And within three years a lot of
bacteria are resistant to it,

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and within five years
maybe physicians

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.154 align:middle line:84%
don't want to prescribe
your drug anymore

01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're not sure if it's
going to work in their patients

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.140 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Why would you make that drug?

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to recoup
that billion dollars?

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
When you look at it
through that lens,

01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
making something like
Viagra or statins or insulin

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that people will take for
the rest of their lives,

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:53.760 align:middle line:90%
that makes a lot more sense.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%


01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The second side of the
coin is the regulatory.

01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The Food and Drug Administration
has completely changed the way

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that it looks at
antibiotic clinical trials,

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and the reasons for this
relate to very Byzantine

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
statistical concepts.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The effect is that
companies know,

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
A, they don't know how to
get new clinical trials done

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:21.790 align:middle line:90%
for antibiotics.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And even successfully
completing those trials,

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
you have a much lower chance
of getting a drug approved

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
now than in the past.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So tell industry, tell
investors that it's

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.357 align:middle line:84%
going to take much
longer than it used to.

01:03:34.357 --> 01:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be much more
expensive than it used to be,

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have a
much higher risk of failure

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
even if you successfully
complete your phase three

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
trials, and watch those
investors run for the hills.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've done as
a matter of public policy

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.200 align:middle line:90%
in antibiotic development.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to encourage
developers to be willing

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to bring forward antibiotics
that might be antibiotics that

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.660 align:middle line:90%
we don't use very often.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is not reasonable
to expect new antibiotics

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.419 align:middle line:90%
to all be best selling drugs.

01:04:05.419 --> 01:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, if they
become best selling drugs,

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
we're probably not
using them correctly.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What we need to go after
is thinking through where

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get our
antibiotics rather than trying

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.830 align:middle line:84%
to fork over a lot of money to
some big pharma company to come

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:20.130 align:middle line:90%
up with the next blockbuster.

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what's that
really going to solve?

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of like,
you have a new car

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and you drive it on a
road which is really bad.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So your new car goes bad,
and so you say, well,

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
what I really need to fix that
problem is another new car.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.361 align:middle line:84%
No, what we really
need is a better road.

01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.840 align:middle line:90%

01:04:45.845 --> 01:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The stuff we have
today are going

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to work just as well 50 years
from now as they do today.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't develop
any new antibiotics,

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the beast is
that the stuff we have today

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
are not going to work anymore.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
That's bacteria using
their genes to adapt.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to develop new
ones, or we will not

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.919 align:middle line:90%

let's just call it fisheries.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, a
problem with fisheries

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
is that there is too many
people catching fish,

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.469 align:middle line:84%
because any fish they
leave in the ocean

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is basically lost to them
because someone else is

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:33.680 align:middle line:90%
going to catch it.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the same
problem with antibiotics, which

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.135 align:middle line:84%
is if I don't use
their effectiveness,

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
it's gone tomorrow
because someone else

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to be using
up their effectiveness.

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, it
takes the problem

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
of antibiotics out of the
realm of medical science,

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
which it is a medical
problem, but it's really

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
a problem of behavior of
individuals and of societies.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
the very dangerous microbes
that are out there,

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and that probably will
require us to accept some risk

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That is, if we walk around
into our environment,

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
it's probably better
for us in the long run

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to get exposed to the
microbes in the dirt

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and on our mother
and other places.

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So you sort of have to accept
that occasionally some of them

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
are going to make you
sick, and hopefully we'll

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
have treatments
that will allow us,

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
if they make you really
sick, to get rid of them.

>> The best quote that explains
our relationship with microbes

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
came from Nobel laureate
Dr. Joshua Lederberg,

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
who wrote in the magazine
Science that the future

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of humanity and microbes will
likely evolve as episodes

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:51.450 align:middle line:90%
of our wits versus their genes.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Their genes allow them to adapt
to anything we throw at them.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to use our wits
to keep up with their genes.
