>>Everyone's fond of
saying that coastlines,

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and some forest distributions,
and all this stuff are fractal.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, doesn't this imply that
there is then a global fractal?

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a fractal
dimension, which,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
when you feed it
into your computer,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and wrap the data
around a sphere,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the continents and oceans
of Earth should appear.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And in principle, again
to the absurd level,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
you should be able
to then telescope

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.865 align:middle line:84%
in on that portion
of this data that

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
is wrapped around the sphere
that corresponds to the North

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
California, and on
your computer screen

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
should appear Esalen hung
on the cliffs of Big Sur,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
with us sitting in a room
inside, discussing the matter.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Rupert, Terence, I'm Ralph.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.072 align:middle line:84%
Creation, imagination--
my mask is chaos.

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>>In my early LSD
experiences, I seemed

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:10%
to see motifs and
structures that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:10%
gave me an interest
in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:10%
And I went to India with the
intent of studying the Tibetan

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:10%
language, and quickly found
that the whole thing was

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:10%
just overwhelming,
and that I was just

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:10%
a human atom in
the sea of India,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:10%
and that the notion of
encompassing or understanding

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:10%
what this was, was clearly
the task of a lifetime.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And several times in my
life, I have acted out

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:10%
this sort of
ricocheting relationship

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:10%
between the humanities and
the sciences, at times,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:10%
losing myself in the study
of certain schools of poetry,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:10%
or literature, or painting,
and then, at other times,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:10%
spending years reading
the philosophy of science,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:10%
and epistemic basis of physics,
and this sort of thing,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
always trying to get a
resolution on the content

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:10%
of my experience, my lived
experience, which included

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:10%
the psychedelic experience,
which for me, from very

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:10%
early on, was this tremendous
mystery or conundrum, which

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:10%
was set down in the
middle of my being.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it still
continues like that.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I keep returning to that,
testing all the ideas

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.855 align:middle line:84%
against the fullness
of experience.

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The main difference between
our world and the world

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that science tells
us we're living in

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is that science denies the
quirky, freaky, cosmic giggle,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
high plottedness,
completely improbable,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
totally quirky humor that
binds everything together,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and that makes it
something other

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
than an engine in which
atoms blindly run,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:90%
in Whitehead's phrase.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Schrodinger
brilliantly anticipated

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of DNA, and then
Joseph Needham and LL White.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And Erich Jantsch should
be mentioned, actually,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.555 align:middle line:84%
as a precursor of
us all, I think.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Erich Jantsch was a
great pioneer, a great soul.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:10%
And he saw very deeply
into whole systems,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:10%
as did Ilya Prigogine, the
Belgian thermodynamicist.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of all of what
we're doing comes out of that.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
What Prigogine showed
that just brought down

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the house was that there
could be perturbations

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of physical systems
that were unpredictable,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and that would cause the
whole system to actually move

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to a more ordered state
than the initial state.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And this perturbation to
higher states of order

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
looks suspiciously
like a violation

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
of the supposedly inviolate
Second Law of Thermodynamics.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.945 align:middle line:84%
So that looks like a doorway
into an energetic hyperspace.

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, when "A New
Science of Life"

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:10%
came out in 1982 in
America-- it came out

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:10%
a year earlier in England-- I
came to California, because it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:10%
was published in Los Angeles.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
I found myself here at Esalen.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I found an extraordinary new
range of things going on I

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:90%
hadn't known about.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in San Francisco,
a friend who I knew from Europe

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
said to me just the day
before I left "there's

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:90%
somebody you must meet.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
He's called Terence McKenna."

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know much
about Terence.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So I went up there, and,
in this large 1956 Buick,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
we headed off into the
woods in Sonoma County,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:90%
where Terence lives.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And there I met both
Terence and Ralph,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:90%
who was there for the day.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I found that part of my
interest in these other realms

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
of reality, of course, like
many people in this room,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:84%
was stimulated by experience
with psychedelic substances.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
This was before I went to India.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived in India,
I found that India

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of psychedelic
realm, anyway.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.915 align:middle line:90%
It's just an amazing place.

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So in Terence, I
found somebody who

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
knew about that whole
realm, who shared

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
with me an interest in
India, since it played

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
an important part
in his development,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and who have views about
the nature of reality, which

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
complemented my own in
an extraordinary way.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
My own theory is about
memory, and habit in nature.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Terence, I found, had
developed a theory

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
about novelty and
creativity in nature,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
a theory about the quality of
time and the creation process

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
as it is related to the
ongoing flux of events.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And Ralph had a kind of
mathematical theory, which

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
was just the kind of thing
that the view of nature

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to develop needed--
the idea of nature being drawn

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
by goals, or attractors in
the mathematical science

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:90%
of dynamics.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a model of the reality
being pulled from ahead

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:90%
by things called attractors.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a teleological,
animistic view

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of nature dressed up in the
guise of mathematical models,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
which I found most fascinating.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, the meeting
with Ralph and Terence

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
was a step further
towards seeing

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
how one could begin to dream
of a world in which nature was

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
seen as alive, in which
the imagination permeated

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
all reality, in which animals
and plants are seen as part

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of the living texture, the
living components, the cells,

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and the life of Gaia, and
Gaia in the life of the cosmos

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, in fact, a view
of the world as alive, which

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.282 align:middle line:84%
recalls, in some respects,
the old cosmologies

00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world, where
the cosmos was seen as a living

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
organism, where they
thought of the whole cosmos

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
as having a soul, the
soul of the world--

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:90%
the Anima Mundi.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.078 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was brought up
in the field of music,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
but I was attracted
to mathematics early.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 14, I played
in the state symphony.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:10%
After that, I started
in mathematics,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:10%
and I became a professor
at Berkeley, when I was 23.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I had an easy way
in mathematics.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And way the system
works, the carpet

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.816 align:middle line:90%
is unrolled in front of you.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
You have a few choices, but
basically, before you even

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
know what's happening,
the carpet is unrolled,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're down the runnel
into whatever you can

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:90%
do that's useful to the system.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:90%
In this process, I lost nature.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But there was a great gain,
because I love it out there.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I love to be off the planet.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I always did, and to this
day, I spend very little time

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:90%
So it went on in this way.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And by 1967, I was a
professor at Princeton.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I had written three
books on mathematics

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that you need a
microscope to read.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had been studying,
for a long while, chaos.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't call
it "chaos" then,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't see in it any
role in the natural world,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
or in social transformation,
or in the evolution

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't think
about anything out there.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.899 align:middle line:84%
So one day, after my third book
was done, and I was exhausted,

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and I looked up,
and all the students

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
were out in the courtyard,
demonstrating about the Vietnam

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
War, and to open the university
to women students, and so on.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I said what exactly is going on?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Here, they said, take this.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And so like many
people in that year,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
or around that time in 1967,
my career had a bifurcation.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So I went off the track
with psychedelics,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
with meditation, but
especially with searching,

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
with trying everything.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I was living
in a cave in the Himalayas.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I returned
to California,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I was standing on
a street corner

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Cruz in white pajamas.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And a car stopped, and an old
friend from a previous lifetime

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:84%
said "there's somebody
you have to meet.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Get in the car."

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing to do.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It sounded OK.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, I believed
that everything goes perfectly.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.089 align:middle line:84%
You just go along with
the flow, as they said.

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it would
be a two hour drive.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.713 align:middle line:90%
So I got in the car.

00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
There was the two hour
drive to Berkeley.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally
dumped out of the car

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:90%
on Terence's front step.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard of
Terence at the time-- 1972.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And I went in, and
what happened then-- I

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
would still say
that although we've

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
had many wonderful talks,
and exciting, thrilling,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and nutritious times in
the meanwhile, that that

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:90%
was quite a miraculous chat.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Many subjects came up-- how to
grow mushrooms, outer space.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.521 align:middle line:84%
Anything you could think of
all passed by in the course

00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:90%
of an hour or two.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:10%
In this way, we became
friends, and this habit we had,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:10%
this activity that
we do-- I mean,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:10%
we never go for a hike
or something like that.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:90%
We sit in the evening, and talk.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
About what happens is
synergistic, miraculous

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:90%
growth-- evolutionary.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And in this
revitalization of my work,

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and eventually the whole
field of mathematics,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
my conversations with
Terence-- whereas I

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
think we thought of them
as just good fun-- did

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
have a really fundamental
influence on everything

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I've done since.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.275 align:middle line:84%
So fun-- I would say
"fun" is insulting.

00:12:50.275 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean "thrilling," because
of going to the edge,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.884 align:middle line:84%
going beyond the edge,
having company there,

00:12:55.884 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
finding things which
you can bring back,

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and they work, and become part
of everything you're doing.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's opened up
these phenomena

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
characterized by chaotic,
irregular, that is to say,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
not well ordered in
the previous paradigm

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.636 align:middle line:90%
of space-time structure.

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:10%
For example, relationships among
people, the states and change

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:10%
of states of society, the
whole process of history,

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:10%
the intuitive experience,
subjective experience

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:10%
of relationships and
so on-- all of this,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:10%
what we always wanted to come
onto the view of a better

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:10%
understanding.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, it's possible.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.082 align:middle line:84%
But although it's
possible, it's not done.

00:13:46.082 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:90%
But we can do it.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:90%
We can try to do it.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The flutter of the moth's
wing can trigger the hurricane.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:90%
This is not a poetic statement.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the fact of the matter
within this kind of description

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
very small changes

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
create cascades where whole
states shift and are perturbed.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
kind of situation

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that we are facing as a society
and a planetary species.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
We have the resources.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
We have the knowledge.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But what we seem
to lack is the will

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
to implement these things,
to actually step back

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:90%
from the abyss.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So it has to come
through a change of mind.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And this new mathematical
stuff is telling us

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that the intimations
of mysticism,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
the intimation of a
possibility of transcendence

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%
is all firmly grounded.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as
though mathematics

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is the extreme cutting edge
of human understanding.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
How can we quickly export
these new understandings

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that release us from a need
for closure, that free us

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.305 align:middle line:90%
from an either/or universe?

00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
How can we quickly
export these models

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
from the realm of
research mathematics

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:90%
into the realm of daily life?

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I really see it
as politics almost

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
at the viral level,
that we are trying

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to create new languages,
and new concepts,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and not only create them,
but teach them to you.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And we ourselves repeat
them, over and over again,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and you feed back into this.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:90%
And then we refine the meme.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And then a meme is like a gene.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It can be replicated.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have not seen
language as the playing

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
field of the creation
of the new paradigm,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:90%
but that's really where it is.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
We can transform
ourselves no more quickly

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:90%
than we transform our language.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way we
transform our language

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is by really pushing
on the envelope

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:90%
of the act of communication.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, the caterpillar
in Alice in Wonderland

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
says say what you mean,
and mean what you say.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm a biologist by background.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I studied biology, because
I was interested in animals

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and plants.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I was studying
it at Cambridge,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I began to have terrible
doubts about what

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I was doing, because everything
that really interested me

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
about animals and
plants somehow vanished,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
when I got into the
biochemistry laboratories.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I was majoring in
biochemistry, and I did

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:90%
a Ph.D. In biochemistry there.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
But there's a curious
thing about biochemistry.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You're doing
biochemistry, to study

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:90%
the molecular basis of life.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Yet the very first thing
you do in the laboratory

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
is kill whatever
you're studying.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Grind it up, extract
the enzymes, and then,

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
in a test tube,
study the properties

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of some of these
molecules extracted

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:90%
from this killed organism.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And it began to occur to me that
perhaps this wasn't the best

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:90%
way to understand life.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't quite know want to
do about it, because everybody

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
else thought it definitely was
the best way to study life,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, there was
no other valid way.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:90%
So this set me thinking.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see that
the science of biology

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
could be reformed, that this
idea that living organisms

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
are truly life, rather
than being just machines,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
whereas the official doctrine
in mechanistic theory

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
says living organisms are
just complicated machines.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, it's
still the official doctrine

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
of academic biology
and academic medicine.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:90%
These ideas went on developing.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I then saw how I could
bring them all together

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
in a synthesis, and
into a new way of seeing

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.846 align:middle line:90%
how biology could be done.

00:18:35.846 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book
while still in India

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
called "A New Science
of Life." in it,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
the basic idea I'm
suggesting is that there's

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
a kind of inherent memory in
all kinds of animals and plants.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.385 align:middle line:84%
Each species has its
own collective memory.

00:18:49.385 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So each member of
the species draws

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
on this collective memory,
and in turn contributes to it.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
The instincts of
animals, for example,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
the behavioral of cuckoos, the
spinning of webs by spiders,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are like a memory, a
habit, of the species.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
This inheritance takes
place by the process

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I call "morphic
resonance," by a kind

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of invisible, intangible
memory, a kind of resonance

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
between present and past
organisms of the same kind.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The same theory helps
explain how our own memory

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
works by a resonance
between our own past

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and our present states.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
It leads to the idea that
our memories aren't stored

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
in our brains, but
that we're tuning

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
into them by this process
of morphic resonance.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Rupert's notions
revision causality.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:84%
That means induct you
into an entirely new way

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%
in which things happen.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is after
all where we're all

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
spending a lot of our time.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The models that
Ralph is working with

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:84%
show that the world is
not an engine running down

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
toward a heat death, but
a tremendous kaleidoscope

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
of unpredictable, creative, open
ended activity on every level.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really a
dazzlingly kaleidoscopic vision.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like a Sufi
hierophany or something.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing it on
the screens of computer

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
simulations, of this
mathematical domain that

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is also the neural
domain, that is also

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
the social domain, that is
also the echo-planetary domain.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:90%
This is not error.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:90%
This is not mysticism.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the real
facts of how it is,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.724 align:middle line:90%
how the world fits together.

00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:46.096 align:middle line:84%
It fits together through the
infusion of its invisible soul.

00:20:46.096 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>If nature is evolutionary,
if all of nature is evolving,

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
what about the eternal
laws of nature,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
which scientists have taken for
granted for so many centuries?

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Concepts going right
back to Pythagoras

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient Greeks?

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Were all the laws of nature
there before the Big Bang?

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Well,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
If they were there
before the Big Bang,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:90%
where could they possibly be?

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:90%
There was nowhere to be.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:90%
There was no universe.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So if the laws of nature were
all there before the Big Bang,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
then they must be non-physical,
idea-like entities dwelling

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of permanent,
mathematical mind,

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
be that thought of
as the mind of God,

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:42.024 align:middle line:84%
or just the mind of a
disembodied mathematician.

00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They were thought
to be permanent,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and all there
before the universe.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
This assumption is
still held by most

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.199 align:middle line:90%
of our modern cosmologists.

00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
physicists have not yet

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:90%
begun to question seriously.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see,
it's like an idea

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that's had the carpet
taken from under it.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
It's hanging over an
abyss, because there's

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.295 align:middle line:84%
no reason why we should
assume the laws of nature

00:22:05.295 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
are permanent in an
evolving universe.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
If the universe is evolving,
then the laws of nature

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:90%
could be evolving as well.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the very
idea of the laws of nature

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:90%
may not be appropriate.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
It may be better to think of
the habits of nature evolving.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang is like the
cracking of the cosmic egg.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
That's its
mythological correlate,

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the notion of the ancient
mythological idea of the cosmos

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
beginning through the hatching
or the cracking of an egg.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Followed by the growth of
the organism that comes out,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:90%
it's an embryological metaphor.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And we now have a developmental
model of the whole universe.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like a developing organism.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.066 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
machine at all anymore.

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a growing,
developing organism,

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:84%
which is differentiating within
itself, forming new forms,

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and patterns-- an evolutionary
process that, on Earth, has

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
given rise to all the forms
of animal and plant life,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:84%
all the different
kinds of microbes

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves, and to the
many and varied forms

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.835 align:middle line:90%
of human culture.

00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:08.705 align:middle line:84%
A theory of evolutionary
habits demands a theory

00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:90%
of evolutionary creativity.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:84%
How can we understand
the creativity

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that's given rise to new ideas,
to Beethoven's symphonies,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to theories in science,
to new works of art,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to new forms of culture, to
instincts in birds and animals,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
to the forms of flowers,
and plants, and leaves,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
to the many kinds of
rocks and crystals,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and to all the forms of
galactic, and stellar,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:90%
and planetary organization?

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
What kind of creativity could
underlie all those processes?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:84%
One is the materialist
view that says

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing is entirely
due to blind chance,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
but a darkness

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
of blind, material
processes going on.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And then by blind chance
new things happen.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The other model for
understanding creativity,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I think, is provided
by our imaginations.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Our imaginations are not full
of fixed, platonic ideas,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
which are always the
same, like platonic minds.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They're ongoing, changing,
dynamical processes

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of creative richness
that always surprises us.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, if nature
is alive rather than dead,

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
if the universe,
if the Earth, have

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
a mind or soul of their
own, if living organisms are

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.150 align:middle line:84%
in some sense
mind-like, or if there's

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
a mind-like process
of work in nature,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
then how does this
express its creativity?

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then the question is,
could this creativity in nature

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:84%
be a product of the imagination
of Gaia, of the Gaian mind?

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Could it be a product of
the cosmic imagination?

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Could that be a
kind of imagination

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
working in nature,
which is similar

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
to our own imaginations?

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Could our imaginations be
just one conscious aspect

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:84%
of an imagination working
through the whole natural

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
world, perhaps
unconsciously as it

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
works underneath the surface of
our dreams, perhaps sometimes

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:90%
consciously?

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And could this
ongoing imagination

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
be the basis of evolutionary
creativity in nature,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.545 align:middle line:84%
just as it is in
the human realm?

00:25:20.545 --> 00:25:23.852 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.852 --> 00:25:25.313 align:middle line:90%
>>Set her on down.

00:25:25.313 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Hello, Houston.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Sweet 16 has arrived.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>How would it be-- or is
it credible that perhaps

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is a kind
of system in which more

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
advanced forms of order actually
influence previous states

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
of organization?

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what is emerging
in Ralph Abraham's work

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
with the chaotic attractors.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They are attractors.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
That means but they
exert influence

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
on less organized
states, and pull them

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:90%
toward some kind of end state.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And for me, the key to unlocking
what is going on with history,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:10%
creativity, progressive
process of all sorts,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:10%
is to place the state of
completion at the end,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:10%
but to see it as a kind of
higher dimensional object,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.240 align:middle line:10%
which casts an enormous
and flickering shadow

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:10%
over the lower dimensions
of organization

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:10%
of which this universe is one.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So that, for instance,
in the human domain,

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
when we look at
history, what we see

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is an endless series
of anticipations.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:90%
The golden age is coming.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The Messiah is immediately
around the corner.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Great change is
soon to be upon us.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:90%
These are intimations of change.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though the
transcendental object that

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
is the great attractor
in many, many dimensions

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
throws out images of
itself, which filter down

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
through these lower
dimensional matrices,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and actually are the basis
of the appetition of nature

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
for greater expression
of form, the appetition

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of the human soul for
greater immersion in beauty,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
the appetition of human
history for greater

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:90%
expression of complexity.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So when I think about these
terms-- chaos, creativity,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
imagination-- I see
them as a three stroke

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:90%
engine of some sort.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Each impels and runs the other,
and sets up a reinforcing cycle

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that then stabilizes
organisms, processes,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that are caught up in this
in the phenomenon of being.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:84%
The phenomenon of being is
this self-synergizing engine

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
out of chaos,
through creativity,

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
into the imagination,
back into chaos, out

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
into creativity, and
so forth, and so on.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it operates on many
levels simultaneously,

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
so that the planet is
undergoing a destiny.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Deep time, the time of geology,
was only really discovered

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
around the turn of the century.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is cosmically ennobling
to think of the universe

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.190 align:middle line:90%
as a thing of great age.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it's
time to put in place, next

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of deep
cosmic time, the notion

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of chaotic, sudden change, cusp
flux, and sudden perturbation.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what deep
time has revealed,

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:84%
as we've pushed our
understanding of the career

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
of organic life back
65 million years,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
270 million years, what we
see is tremendous punctuation

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:90%
built into the universe.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the Earth in
the form of asteroidal impacts,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
this thing which happened
65 million years ago,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:84%
nothing larger than a
chicken walked away from it

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's a strange
paradox, where

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
taking deep time seriously,
the message of deep time is you

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
may not have as much
time as you thought,

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
dynamic, capable of turning

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:90%
sudden corners.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So then the imagination
becomes a beacon.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The imagination is, as it
were, a scout sent ahead,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
or something which has preceded
us into history, and in fact,

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of
eschatological object.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It is shedding influence,
the morpho-genetic field,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:90%
if you wish.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
If the morpho-genetic
field is not

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
subject to the inverse square
law of decreased influence

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
over distance, then I, as
a layman, don't see why,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Rupert, we couldn't locate it
at the conclusion of process.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things that's
always puzzled me about the Big

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Bang is it's a singularity.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the term
physicists use for it.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:84%
This means theory
cannot predict it,

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and yet it is necessary to make
everything which follows from

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:90%
it happen.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So you just say there's
no reason for this.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We have no argument for this,
but the rest of the theory

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:90%
needs it.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a singularity, and
the immense improbability,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
which modern science rests
on, but cares not to discuss,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is this-- the belief that the
universe sprang from nothing

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:90%
in a single moment.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can make that
leap, to believe that,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to see
what you couldn't believe.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:84%
That is almost the limiting case
of credulity, I would think.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So in order to save
the phenomenon,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I would propose
a different idea.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is
eminently reasonable.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is that as the complexity
of a system increases,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:37.640 align:middle line:84%
so too does the likelihood of
its generating a singularity,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:84%
or an unpredictable
perturbation.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So the pre-existent
state of the universe

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I imagine to be extremely
simple, and unflawed

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
nothingness, in other words,
the least likely situation

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
in which you would expect
a singularity to emerge.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But now let's look at the other
end of the historical continuum

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:90%
of the history of the universe.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
world we're living,

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
which is full of 106 elements,
tremendous gradients of energy,

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:84%
ranging from what's going on
inside pulsars and quasars,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to what is going on
inside viruses and cells,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:84%
tremendous organizational
capacity at the atomic level,

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
at the molecular
level, at the level

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of molecular
polymerization, at the level

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
of membranes and
gels, at the level

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:47.715 align:middle line:84%
of cells and organelles,
organisms, societies,

00:33:47.715 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and so on.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
universe, at this moment,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is a tremendously complicated,
integrated, multi-leveled,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.520 align:middle line:90%
dynamic thing.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And every passing moment,
it becomes more so.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what evolution,
history, compression

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of time-- what all
of these things

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.870 align:middle line:84%
are attempting to
indicate is the increasing

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.749 align:middle line:90%
complexity of reality.

00:34:13.749 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
If a singularity is necessary
to explain this universe,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that singularity
must emerge rather

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
near the end of the
complexification process

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:90%
rather than its beginning.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
You see, we simply have to
reverse our preconceptions

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:84%
about the flow of
cause and effect,

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and then we get
a great attractor

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
that pulls all organization
and structure toward itself

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:90%
over several billion years.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
And as the objects
of its attraction

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
grow closer to its proximity,
they somehow interpenetrate.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:07.002 align:middle line:84%
They set up standing wave
patterns of interference.

00:35:07.002 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
New properties become
emergent, and the entire thing

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:90%
complexifies.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, to my mind, this is
the divine imagination.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.945 align:middle line:90%
This is what Blake called it.

00:35:25.945 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the only way
I can conceive of it.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Time is the theater
of God's becoming.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's also, from
the point of view

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
of a higher
dimensional manifold,

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:90%
a kind of fait accompli.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is no contradiction.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Or if it is, it's all right.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Because in these realms
of higher ontology,

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:84%
you're always asked to
avoid closure, and hold

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
the notion of a
coincidentia oppositorum,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:90%
a union of opposites.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing is both what it
is, and what it is not,

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and yet it somehow
escapes contradiction.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the open
system is maintained.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how the miracle
of life is possible.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think of the
divine imagination

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
as the class of all things
both possible and beautiful.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
reverse Platonism.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
The attractor is at the bottom
of a very deep pit into which

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:90%
all phenomena is cascading.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
What is taught in
modern universities

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.980 align:middle line:84%
these days is that these tracks
in the snow are going nowhere.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The technical term is
"trendlessly fluctuating."

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're told that history
is this kind of process.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:90%
It's trendlessly fluctuating.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:90%
It goes here.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:90%
It goes there.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.495 align:middle line:84%
It's called a "random walk"
in information theory.

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It means you just wander around.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And well, it's very interesting.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we begin to see through the
marvel of the new mathematics

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:84%
that random walks are not random
at all, that a sufficiently

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:26.566 align:middle line:84%
long random walk becomes
a fractal structure

00:37:26.566 --> 00:37:29.810 align:middle line:84%
of extraordinary
depth and beauty.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So you see, really
what has to happen

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is for us to see
chaos not as something

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that degrades information, and
is somehow the enemy of order,

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but rather chaos is the
birthplace of order.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Chaos is not the problem.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Chaos is the answer.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>I think a factor
which changes everything

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is the discovery of
dark matter, the fact

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that 90% to 95%, 99% of
the matter in the universe

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.150 align:middle line:90%
is utterly unknown to us.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:84%
This recent
discovery effectively

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:84%
tells us that the whole cosmos,
and every material thing in it,

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of unconscious,
a material unconscious,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:84%
an unknown dark realm,
which conditions

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.234 align:middle line:84%
everything that happens--
the shapes of the galaxies,

00:38:22.234 --> 00:38:23.025 align:middle line:90%
their interactions.

00:38:23.025 --> 00:38:26.665 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.665 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Is Gaia, as it were,
awake on the side

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that's in the sunlight, and in
the side that's in the darkness

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:90%
as it rotates dreaming?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.770 align:middle line:84%
At night, are the plants, the
animals, the whole ecosystems,

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:84%
the oceans, in some
sense, in the dream state,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
when dreams and
spontaneous images of what

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:90%
might be possible come to them?

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So is there a kind
of Gaian dreaming?

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And does it happen on the
nightside of the planet?

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
What would the Gaian
mind feel like?

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:84%
What form would a
Gaian dream take?

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Or what form would a Gaian
psychedelic experience take?

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>The psychedelic
experience, it's

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
preposterous to
attempt to analyze it

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.780 align:middle line:90%
in terms of human motivation.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.650 align:middle line:84%
At its intense levels,
it seems rather

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to be an ontological
reality of its own

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that the human being
has simply been

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:90%
privileged to briefly observe.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.640 align:middle line:90%
But it says no more.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Your deep psychedelic
experiences

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
say no more about
your personality

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.290 align:middle line:84%
than that the
continent of Africa

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:84%
is making a statement
about your personality.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:84%
They are, in fact,
independent objects.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
To my mind, the
divine imagination,

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:84%
or the imagination,
is the source

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of all creativity in our dreams,
in our psychedelic experiences,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles, in the
currents of the ocean,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in the organization of
protozoan and microbial life.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Wherever there is large
scale integration rather than

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
simply raw physics, but
integration of laws of physics,

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
integration of properties, of
membranes and electrophoresis,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and this sort of thing, it
is the creative principle.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So do you think then that
in psychedelic experiences,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:84%
you're actually tapping into,
tuning into, or experiencing

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.035 align:middle line:84%
something of the Gaian or
the cosmic imagination?

00:40:32.035 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that psychedelic
experiences and dreams are only

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:84%
different in degree, that they
are chemical cousins somehow.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I could see
human history as a Gaian dream.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, every night,
when you descend into dream,

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
you are potentially
open to receiving

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Gaian corrective tuning
of your life state.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is an
enzyme-driven process.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:90%
We are like an organ of Gaia.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We are the organ which
binds and releases energy.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a liver
cell doesn't need

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
to understand why it binds and
releases enzymes of the liver.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We bind and release energy
for reasons perhaps never

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:28.520 align:middle line:84%
to be clear to us,
but which place us

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:84%
firmly within the context
of the Gaian mind.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
We have been chosen out--
and this is not something

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:90%
to have great hubris about.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, indoleacetic
acid has been chosen out

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.090 align:middle line:84%
in plant metabolism
to play certain roles.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a role, but our role
seems to be a major one.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We are like a triggering system
out of the general background

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary processes
mediated by incoming radiation

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of the Earth,
and then natural selection.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we come with
an epigenetic capability.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We write books, tell stories,
dance, sing, carve, paint.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:90%
These are not genetic processes.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:84%
These are epigenetic processes,
and they bind information,

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and express the
Gaian mind very well.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.160 align:middle line:84%
As an example of
how willing I am

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to entertain this
idea concretely,

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking to a lot of
people about ecological crisis,

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and the fate of the world,
and this sort of thing.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine in
hindsight the wisdom

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that we would impute to Gaia,
if we were to suddenly realize

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that what is happening
on this planet

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is that nature knows that
the sun is going to explode.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And what we are is a kind of
response to the anticipation

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:90%
of a wounding.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:84%
50,000 million years ago, the
geo-heliocentric relationships

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.420 align:middle line:90%
began to vibrate out of tune.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence
of this, a species

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
was called forth that
could organize and escape.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And we are it.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are in a
divine play in line with this.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And what made me even
entertain these ideas

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is I had a very bizarre
experience recently.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in Hawaii, and in
our botanical garden,

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:90%
there is a very large dead tree.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And one limb of this tree
sticks far out over the land.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And banisteriopsis caapi, a
large, hallucinogenic, South

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:84%
American vine is planted
at the bottom of this tree.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And it just has
swarmed up this tree,

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and covered it with greenery.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't go out onto
this one limb that stuck out.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And it bothered my
sense of symmetry

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that this vine would not
completely cover this tree.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I even thought about trying
to climb up into the tree,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and thread it out
onto this limb,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:90%
to get it to do what I wanted.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting, looking at
this tree and this situation,

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and actually thinking about it.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, the limb fell.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It broke off.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought the vine
senses that it was unstable.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It would not invade this
domain that it sensed

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.640 align:middle line:90%
was structurally unstable.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I said to
myself, but how could it?

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:15.140 align:middle line:84%
What is the mechanism of
this sensing of instability?

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine said
that perhaps the wind

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.900 align:middle line:84%
impacts on weakened
wood differently

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.830 align:middle line:90%
than on unrotted wood.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps rhythms in the tree
tell it to stay away from them.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:36.460 align:middle line:10%
And then I realized if one plant
has that kind of sensitivity

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:10%
to the entering into
a domain of danger,

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.950 align:middle line:10%
what must the ecosystem
of this planet

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:10%
be doing in reaction to what
we are doing to the planet?

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So the reason this
relates to the imagination

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is because I see
ourselves in communication

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:90%
with the imagination.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It is sending images
back into the past,

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to try and direct us away
from areas of instability.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:90%
The Gaian mind is a real mind.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Its messages are real messages.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And our task,
through discipline,

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics,
attention to detail--

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:28.010 align:middle line:84%
whatever we have going, is to
try and extract this message,

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate ourselves
from the message,

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:84%
so that we then can see
the face of the other.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.134 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.134 --> 00:46:39.586 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is the
field of chaos.

00:46:39.586 --> 00:46:42.317 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.317 --> 00:46:43.942 align:middle line:84%
For a certain setting
of the parameter,

00:46:43.942 --> 00:46:47.814 align:middle line:84%
form will emerge out
of the field of chaos.

00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And where this happens
reliably, we've

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.320 align:middle line:90%
explored the ocean all over.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And we've found a
favorite regions.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're called the Apache
Rift, The Calico Mountain,

00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and the Scroll Reef.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:03.257 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.257 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So the submarine is dragging
along at a 1,000 iterations

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:10.540 align:middle line:84%
depth in the ocean
of chaos, comes

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:90%
across these regular patterns.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:20.085 align:middle line:84%
This is the first wing
of the Apache Valley.

00:47:20.085 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>This is Apache Valley.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.484 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.484 --> 00:47:26.025 align:middle line:90%
>>I think so.

00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:28.995 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.995 --> 00:47:30.975 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got another
field of chaos.

00:47:30.975 --> 00:47:48.785 align:middle line:90%


00:47:48.785 --> 00:47:49.785 align:middle line:90%
This is Calico Mountain.

00:47:49.785 --> 00:47:52.755 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.755 --> 00:47:55.477 align:middle line:84%
See, these are just snapshots
of different starting positions,

00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:57.210 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.509 align:middle line:84%
Later on, we drill a deep
hole in this area and all

00:47:59.509 --> 00:48:00.675 align:middle line:90%
the other interesting areas.

00:48:00.675 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Why does it have this
quaternary structure.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>That is the question.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:90%
This is Scroll Reef.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.964 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.964 --> 00:48:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a little presumptuous
to call this chaos theory,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
because as a matter of
fact, there is no theory.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.580 align:middle line:84%
We're in the
exploration phase now.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.685 align:middle line:84%
And this is
experimental mathematics

00:48:21.685 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing
with supercomputers.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.005 align:middle line:84%
This video was made
out of these simple

00:48:27.005 --> 00:48:31.390 align:middle line:84%
as possible dynamical systems
called the logistic equation.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And it just produces
a series-- it's very

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.680 align:middle line:90%
similar to a dripping faucet.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So you could just
as well imagine

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:46.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have 16,000 dripping
faucets in an array 128 by 128.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And the time between
drops is represented

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.860 align:middle line:90%
as a color on the screen.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, do think that if you
had 16,000 dripping faucets,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:84%
you could get out of them a
pattern like Calico Mountain?

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It relates to waterfalls, for
example, when the spray comes

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:05.110 align:middle line:90%
off the waterfall.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And here's another example
of a chaotic system.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Could you write some
equations, and obtain

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.940 align:middle line:84%
a computer program
that simulated

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.590 align:middle line:90%
the spray from a waterfall?

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And from this
totally chaotic data,

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.740 align:middle line:84%
viewed in this particular way,
which is called "chaoscophy."

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You get this points
in the plains

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that, if the data
was really random,

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.260 align:middle line:84%
the dots would be
all over the plane.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they lie on a
curve, a smooth curve.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is called
the chaotic attractor.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, it happens.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot
of theory behind this,

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.820 align:middle line:84%
enough to suggest that it's
not some kind artifact.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
No matter what kind
of artifact it is,

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.850 align:middle line:90%
it's an interesting artifact.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I'd like to call
this a mathematical law.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the emergence
of form from a field of chaos.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
else to call it.

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not a mathematical law
that was known to Pythagoras.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
it was always there

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of time,
long before the Big Bang,

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:14.250 align:middle line:84%
or if it just emerged into the
evolving field of the Gaian

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.796 align:middle line:84%
mind through the fact that
computers make it visible.

00:50:16.796 --> 00:50:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But the theory can tell
you certain transformations

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.860 align:middle line:90%
you'll expect, and others not.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:27.055 align:middle line:84%
For example, Terence had
pointed to the punctual aspect

00:50:27.055 --> 00:50:31.370 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, that many
transformations are saltatory.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:32.520 align:middle line:90%
They are catastrophic.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.450 align:middle line:84%
They are abrupt,
as, for example,

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.870 align:middle line:84%
in the emergence of
form, as, for example,

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.450 align:middle line:84%
in the neolithic
revolution, as, for example,

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:44.250 align:middle line:84%
in the crystallization
of the planets.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>As the temperature drops
in the developing universe,

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.400 align:middle line:84%
according to standard
models, more and more form

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.640 align:middle line:90%
comes into being.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.380 align:middle line:84%
First, you get atoms, then
stars and galaxies condense.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Then you get solar systems.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And through the cooling of
matter, you can get planets.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Planets are the cooled
remnants of exploding stars.

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:84%
The elements in us
and in our planets

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:84%
are stardust formed
from supernovae.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.820 align:middle line:84%
One way of looking at this is
to see the expansion and cooling

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.840 align:middle line:84%
process, and, indeed, the flow
of events-- thinking of it

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.920 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the flux of energy.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
unifying concepts

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.260 align:middle line:84%
of 19th century physics is a
unified conception of energy.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not entirely
clear what energy is.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Energy, in some sense, is
the principle of change.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The more there is, the change
that can be brought about.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.870 align:middle line:84%
It's in a sense a
causative principle.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's a causative principle,
which exists in a process.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And this process, the energetic
influx of the universe,

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:49.890 align:middle line:84%
underlies time,
change, becoming.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And the flux
process itself seems

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:58.010 align:middle line:84%
to have an inherent
indeterminism to it.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.260 align:middle line:84%
This flux process,
the universal flux,

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is organized into
forms by fields.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Matter is now thought of as
energy bound within fields,

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the quantum matter fields,
and the fields of molecules,

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.577 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:52:12.577 --> 00:52:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And think there are
many of these organizing

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.160 align:middle line:90%
fields, the morphic fields.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And nature is the theater
of these habitual fields,

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:84%
organizing the indeterminate
flux of energy.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Fields themselves, by having
this energy within them,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.490 align:middle line:84%
have this indeterminate
quality too.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So even organized systems of
a high level of complexity

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:35.060 align:middle line:84%
still have this
probabilistic quality.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The fields that
organize this energy,

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to give rise to material
and physical forms,

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.460 align:middle line:90%
are themselves probabilistic.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Chaos is never eliminated.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There's always this
indeterminism or spontaneity

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:90%
at all levels of organization.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's a formative
principle, which is the fields.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's an energetic
principle, which, I think,

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:90%
has the chaos inherent in it.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of change,
which, left as pure change,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:90%
would be chaos.

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.070 align:middle line:84%
One way of thinking
of these is in terms

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Indian notion
of Shakti as the energy

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.310 align:middle line:84%
indeterminate
principle, and Shiva

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:11.380 align:middle line:84%
as the formative
principle, working together

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in a tantric union, to give
the world that we know.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>All creation begins in
chaos, progresses in chaos,

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and ends in chaos.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And in Hesiod, this
word "chaos" appears

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in a piece called "Theogony,"
which is a theogony.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, more or
less, a creation tale.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.830 align:middle line:84%
They're the stories of
the creation of the gods

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.896 align:middle line:90%
and goddesses, one by one.

00:53:42.896 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're not gods
and goddesses, really.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.320 align:middle line:90%
They're abstract principles.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The three main ones are
Chaos, Gaia, and Eros.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're the most abstract
earliest protoconcepts

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:02.442 align:middle line:84%
of Sky, Earth, and the
creative tension in between.

00:54:02.442 --> 00:54:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the meaning of
chaos, the first time

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the word appeared in literature,
has got nothing whatsoever,

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.590 align:middle line:84%
apparently, superficially,
to do with what

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
we mean by chaos in the English
language, and in ordinary life.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It meant only, to
Hesiod, according

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to the lexicon, the gaping
void between Heaven and Earth,

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:90%
out of which the creation came.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So creation of chaos,
yes, but the chaos

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:38.810 align:middle line:84%
did not mean disorder
or anything negative.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It only meant this gaping void.

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, after understanding
that, you look up.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.993 align:middle line:84%
You think of these
different interpretations

00:54:45.993 --> 00:54:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of sky god concept, and the
gap, and the opening, and so on.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
sky, the most obvious

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:84%
chief characteristic feature
of the sky is the Milky Way.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And it does appear as a kind
of gap between this and that.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The royal road of
the gods traveling

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.980 align:middle line:84%
between the underworld
and the overworld.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that, you
can then connect the word

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:15.190 align:middle line:84%
with an earlier word
concept, or god or goddess,

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:17.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning the same thing
as what you visually see

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.770 align:middle line:84%
represented in the
Milky Way itself.

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle line:10%
And that is in one of its
most popular representations--

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:29.690 align:middle line:10%
Tiamat, the goddess of
chaos from Enuma Elish,

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:34.330 align:middle line:10%
the creation poem,
the greatest epic poem

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.980 align:middle line:10%
of Babylonian
literature, discovered

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.710 align:middle line:10%
in the Library of
Ashurbanipal at Nineveh--

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.980 align:middle line:10%
a recent discovery.

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.950 align:middle line:84%
There was this story of
the origin of the gods

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of the
world by Tiamat and Apsu,

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.270 align:middle line:84%
the god and goddess
of chaos, who

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:58.567 align:middle line:84%
lived in the water-- one more
sweet water, and the other salt

00:55:58.567 --> 00:55:59.760 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And they created then the whole
pantheon, and the whole world,

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
along came Marduk.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Marduk was a younger
generation of gods,

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and the next generation.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And there was a conflict between
the older and the younger

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.620 align:middle line:10%
gods over how the
world ought to be run.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, this
conflict was taking place

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.855 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a
social transformation,

00:56:25.855 --> 00:56:29.770 align:middle line:84%
a transformation represented
in the mythological

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:84%
by the demotion
of Apsu and Tiamat

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:84%
from the pantheon of
Babylon, the city Babylon,

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.135 align:middle line:90%
and the replacement by Marduk.

00:56:38.135 --> 00:56:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Marduk eventually became the
god, the Mr Big of Babylon

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.800 align:middle line:84%
around 2,000 BC, coinciding
with the sweep of patriarchy

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.000 align:middle line:84%
over that city, propelled
on a new type of war chariot

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with spoked wheels
instead of solid wheels.

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Am I digressing too much?

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>No, you've reached the wheel.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.219 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I've reached
the spoke wheel,

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and its association
with-- is this accidental?

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- with the
patriarchy, and the fact

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that the wheel itself,
as a mathematical model,

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is the paradigm of order,
a divine mathematical form,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.310 align:middle line:84%
according to Plato, as
the planets were supposed

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:31.400 align:middle line:84%
to move before Kepler introduced
the ellipse-- fantastic

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:36.120 align:middle line:84%
transformation, punctual
catastrophe in the history

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.060 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:44.070 align:middle line:84%
In short, according to
this epic, Enuma Elish,

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Tiamat was killed in
the most violent way--

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.580 align:middle line:84%
ripped to pieces, creating
the world, creating

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:55.190 align:middle line:84%
a new order by our hero
of Babylon, Mr Marduk,

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.680 align:middle line:90%
but also Baal, and so on.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:03.650 align:middle line:84%
His new year celebration was
honored at the new year time

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:09.520 align:middle line:84%
all over Old Europe,
including at Stonehenge.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.050 align:middle line:84%
At the New Year's festival,
this epic poem was read.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So annually there was the
reminder that chaos is bad.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Chaos has been killed.

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:20.626 align:middle line:84%
Chaos has been
replaced by order,

00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and order associated with
perfect, periodic, the wheel,

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.730 align:middle line:84%
the cycle, the perfect
roundness, and so on.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in Minoan
Crete, you find,

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.750 align:middle line:84%
according to the evidence
of the excavators

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and all who have examined
the artworks that remain,

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.180 align:middle line:84%
a long lasting fluorescence
of partnerships

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:48.280 align:middle line:84%
culture with no
domination by a male god.

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:53.170 align:middle line:90%


00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's established that there
is the diffusion from Crete

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:57.700 align:middle line:90%
to Greece.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And the last remainder
of Cretan culture,

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a very
interesting one, must

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:06.370 align:middle line:84%
have been the last vestige
of the Garden of Eden.

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about tremendous
happiness and fluorescence

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of beauty in all
aspects of life.

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.410 align:middle line:84%
The importance of
the Chaos Revolution

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:25.350 align:middle line:84%
now is that chaos has
recovered from being demoted,

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:30.800 align:middle line:84%
from being banished to the
unconscious around 2,000 BC

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or so, from then up
to now 4,000 or maybe

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:36.840 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years of the
repression of chaos.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, chaos is to this day,
in our culture, a bad word.

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.270 align:middle line:90%
We have to watch out for chaos.

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It ruins your love life.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It has to be replaced by order.

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, most especially,
hate it, and so on.

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.520 align:middle line:84%
The fact that scientists
of all people,

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.980 align:middle line:84%
in the temple of
science, that Tiamat

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.600 align:middle line:84%
has to be accepted as a friend
and replaced upon her throne,

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.740 align:middle line:90%
this is big news.

00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:03.840 align:middle line:90%


01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that the
importance of the psychedelics

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.830 align:middle line:84%
is primary here, and
that it doesn't simply

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:17.000 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the fact that
they synergize cognition--

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
which they do do--
and the synthetics, as

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.120 align:middle line:90%
well the natural ones.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.456 align:middle line:90%
But it's deeper than that.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's that we have
a secret history.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge of which
has been lost to us,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and only is now
recoverable in the light

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of mindset that
becomes possible to us,

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.200 align:middle line:90%
if we accept the new paradigm.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.470 align:middle line:10%
And what the secret history
is, and has to do with,

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:54.000 align:middle line:10%
and how it relates
to the Gaian mind,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and the world soul
is that we are

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:05.170 align:middle line:10%
the victims of an instance
of traumatic abuse

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:08.400 align:middle line:10%
in childhood, as a species.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.570 align:middle line:10%
Because a symbiotic
relationship with

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:18.770 align:middle line:10%
world-girdling intelligence
of the planet, which

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
was mediated through plants,
through shamanism-- I mean,

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.740 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't an abstraction.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It was an experience--
was eventually

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
broken up, and disrupted by
progressive, climatic drying

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Eurasian and
African landmass.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is, literally,
the fall into history,

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.600 align:middle line:90%
the expulsion from Eden.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
All these primary myths of
a golden age found and lost

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
the fact that once

01:01:53.810 --> 01:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
we lived in dynamic balance
with nature, not as animals do,

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
but as human beings
only could, but in a way

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.510 align:middle line:90%
that we have now lost.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, how have we lost it?

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And what have we lost?

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
How we have lost it
is the way in which

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
these psychoactive compounds
that were being brought

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
into the diet were
acting is they

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
were psycholytic upon
the formation of the ego.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They literally suppressed
the formation of the ego,

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and promoted, instead,
collectivist tribal partnership

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
values, which were
operating intuitionally

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in a resonance relationship
with the feminine vegetable

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
matrix of the planet.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
nothing was verbalized.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything was felt.

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything was intuited.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And regularly, at the
new and full moon,

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
these small groups
of hunter-gatherers,

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
later pastoralists,
gathered and took

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
these hallucinogenic plants,
and dissolved boundaries,

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and engaged in group sex,
and annealed-- a new word

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've brought
in here-- annealed

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
the irregularities
that had cropped up

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
in people's personal
self-imaging

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in the interval since
the last session.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And this kept everything
grounded on the plane

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
of that which is important.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I.E. The values of the
group, of the species,

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of dynamic balance
with the ecosystem,

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and so on.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when this was
disrupted, and the supplies

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
of these plants were diminished,
and new religious forms arose,

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and the time between
the great festivals

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
grew longer and longer, the
ego begins to take hold, first,

01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of cancerous
aberration, but then quickly

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:17.440 align:middle line:84%
becoming a new style of
behavior, which quickly then

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
eliminates all other
styles of behavior

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
by suppressing
access to the chaos.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
point I want to make,

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is between the
ego and full understanding

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
of reality, a barrier, a
problem-- the fear of the ego

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to surrender to
the fact of chaos.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Chaos is what we
have lost touch with.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
This is why it has
been given a bad name.

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it is feared by
the dominant archetype

01:04:55.970 --> 01:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of our world, which is
the ego, which clenches.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Because its existence is
defined in terms of control.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the furious modeling
process-- and this

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
will now sound like a knock on
modeling-- the furious modeling

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
process that the ego
endlessly carries out

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
is an effort to fight
the absence of closure.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:27.330 align:middle line:90%
The ego wants closure.

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:29.630 align:middle line:90%
It wants a complete explanation.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of
wisdom, I believe,

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to accept
an inherent messiness

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in your explanation
of what's going on.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Because nowhere is it
writ that human minds

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
should be able to give a
full accounting of creation

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in all dimensions
and on all levels.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, Wittgenstein
had this idea

01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that philosophy should be
what he called "true enough."

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a great idea.

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's just make it true enough.

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Because that's as true
as it can be gotten.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, the imagination is chaos.

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
New forms are fetched
out of this chaos.

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
For me, the creative act is
the letting down of the net

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of human imagination into the
ocean of chaos on which we are

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:38.450 align:middle line:84%
suspended, and the attempt
to bring out of it ideas,

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to bring out of it-- sometimes--

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.430 align:middle line:90%


01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
This is my model for the
psychedelic experience,

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that it is the
night sea journey,

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that it is the lone fisherman
on a tropical sea with his nets.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And you let these nets
down, and sometimes,

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
something tears through them
that leaves them in shreds.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you just row for shore, and
put your head under your bed,

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and pray.

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And at other times,
what slips through are

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the minutiae, the minnows of
this ichthyological metaphor

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.630 align:middle line:90%
of idea chasing.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you actually
can bring home something that

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is food, that is food for
the human community, that we

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
can sustain ourselves
on, and go forward.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So we haven't talked that
much about art and aesthetics,

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:46.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think, in the human
world, the appetition

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:90%
is for beauty, to my mind.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is another place where
the Platonism shines radiantly

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.540 align:middle line:90%
through.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato held that
the good was the true,

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and that both were
the beautiful.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very quaint
idea from the point of view

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
of modern philosophy,
but I think

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
it's in the bones, when you
actually connect yourself up

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.029 align:middle line:90%
to the planet.

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why chaos is capable of
being the tremendous repository

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
ordered beauty that it is.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:33.609 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no chaos,
in the old definition, which

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is to say that which by
any definition or any test

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:40.410 align:middle line:90%
is found to be disordered.

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
That is just a kind
of hell notion,

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.939 align:middle line:84%
a kind of hypostasization of
an ultimate state of disorder.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But nowhere in the world that is
deployed through space and time

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.270 align:middle line:90%
do you encounter that.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what you
encounter is embedded order

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
upon embedded order,
this fractal thing.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, for
me, the imagination

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
is the goal of history.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I see culture as an effort
to literally realize

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
our collective dreams.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a very crude level,
when it's you make your mask,

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.689 align:middle line:84%
and I make my mask, and then
we dance around together.

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's even at a
very crude level, when

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it's you design
your shopping mall,

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll design my
World Trade Center,

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and we'll put them on the
same piece of real estate.

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're coming
now through media,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe, through virtual
reality, and human machine

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
integration, and this
kind of the thing,

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
into a situation
where the imagination

01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:02.100 align:middle line:84%
is going to be something
that we can share,

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that the path of mind
through its own meanderings

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
will become something that can
be recorded, and played back.

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
We will have the possibility
of living in our own past,

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
or creating and trading
realities as art.

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And art as life lived
in the imagination

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
is the great archetype,
which rears itself up

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.256 align:middle line:84%
at the end of history--
life in the imagination.

01:10:32.256 --> 01:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The imagination is
this auric field,

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
which surrounds the
transcendental object

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
at greater and greater
depth as you approach

01:10:45.210 --> 01:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
the transcendental object.

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And as we now close
distance with it,

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
all of our cultural expression,
all of our self-awareness

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:02.395 align:middle line:84%
is taking on this
curiously designed quality.

01:11:02.395 --> 01:11:04.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you must
have noticed this,

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that the world is very
heavily designed in a way

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.410 align:middle line:10%
that it never was before.

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Morpho-genetic fields
of great size and scope,

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
which are international schools
of architecture and design,

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:21.140 align:middle line:90%
touch whole continents.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Entire cities are given
certain ambiences.

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the summoning
of the imagination

01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
into the human scale.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like a god that we wish to
call down, and draw to Earth.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is why
William Blake called

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.240 align:middle line:90%
it the divine imagination.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the
four-gated city.

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:46.990 align:middle line:90%
It is the flying saucer.

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
We are on a journey to
meet this great attractor,

01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and as we close
distance with it,

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
it is more and more
a multifaceted mirror

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.850 align:middle line:90%
of our images of beauty.

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an
ascending learning

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
curve that becomes asymptotic.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
you're face to face

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
with a mystery, a
living mystery that

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
is within each and all of us.

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the imagination that
argues for the divine spark

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.760 align:middle line:90%
in human beings.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely
confounding, if you

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.550 align:middle line:84%
try to get biology
to produce it for you

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.480 align:middle line:90%
as a necessary quantity.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.720 align:middle line:90%
It isn't that.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.330 align:middle line:90%
It's an emanation from above.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It is literally a descent of
the world soul into all of us.

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We then become the
atoms of the world soul,

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and our channel to it
is by closing our eyes,

01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.155 align:middle line:84%
and obliterating our immediate
personalized space-time locus,

01:13:00.155 --> 01:13:04.154 align:middle line:84%
and falling into the
imagination, which

01:13:04.154 --> 01:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is running like a river
through all of us endlessly,

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
driven by the hydraulic moment
of the cataracts of chaos,

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:23.942 align:middle line:84%
which usher into the
creativity of the imagination.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:28.379 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these river
metaphors are just endlessly

01:13:28.379 --> 01:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
applicable to this-- the flowing
of forces over landscapes,

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.802 align:middle line:84%
the pressure of chaos
on the imagination

01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:38.478 align:middle line:90%
to create creativity.

01:13:38.478 --> 01:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's looping
back into the same.

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And these things are the icons
for the world that wants to be.

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But the key is surrender
dissolution of boundaries,

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
dissolution of the
ego, and a trust

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in the love of the
goddess, which transcends

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
rational understanding.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
There will come a
moment, which will

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.794 align:middle line:90%
be an absolute leap into space.

01:14:11.794 --> 01:14:15.055 align:middle line:84%
And we will simply have to
have the faith that there

01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is something waiting there,
because the dominator style has

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
left us no choice.

01:14:22.390 --> 01:15:41.226 align:middle line:90%
