NARRATOR: Across the
Earth lie the remnants

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of a once-thriving,
spiritual culture-- thousands

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of sacred
sites, in all kinds of shapes

and forms, standing
stones, dolmens,

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
cromlechs, stone circles,
even the odd mound or two.

A large portion still survive in
a crescent area across Western

Europe and the British Isles.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
These monuments were molded
to the surrounding landscape

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
with great sensitivity and
painstakingly constructed

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
so that future
generations could access

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
a vault of knowledge that
lies beyond the limits

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%

Although modern historians paint
their architects as primitive,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
few can explain how such
primitives were able to erect

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
colossal monuments
whose construct

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
modern technology cannot match.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet without
modern technology,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
these people cut, dressed,
and ferried rocks way up

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.477 align:middle line:84%
to 200 tons across
relatively vast distances

00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and challenging terrains.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Why did they go to
so much trouble?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
When we dissect the work
of the temple builders,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see how their
structures are a kind

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:90%
of universal reference library.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
They encode the mathematics
of planetary movements,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions of the
Earth, strategic angles

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
for manipulating energy,
even sacred geometry.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Some temples enhance
the effects of sound.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Others encode their
own latitudinal and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:90%
longitudinal grid coordinates.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.052 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Surely if these were erected
to simply honor the gods,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
as orthodox history tells us,
then why was such information

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.638 align:middle line:90%
and precision necessary?

00:03:32.638 --> 00:03:35.844 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And why did they
choose to encode

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
such knowledge using some of
the hardest rocks on Earth?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.625 align:middle line:84%
Did they wish to
immortalize their genius?

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Or was there another purpose?

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
What is certain is that many of
these so-called pagan temples

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
were so important that they
were assimilated by an emerging

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Roman Catholic church.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:10%
One reason lies eyes in the
root of the word "church,"

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:10%
whose Greek origin,
"kirk-os," means both "circle"

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:10%
and "the house of the Lord."

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So clearly these places were
regarded as oracles, places

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
on Earth where the
connection with other levels

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness appear
to be more immediate.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:10%
When we look into the
invisible knowledge encoded

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:10%
into sacred sites and the
buildings that succeeded them,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:10%
we discover the subtle signs at
work, a mechanism that enabled

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:10%
our ancestors to work
with subtle energies that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.542 align:middle line:10%
permeate the world around us.

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:10%
By looking at the
roots of this enigma,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:10%
we not only gain a new
insight into the motivation

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:10%
of the temple
builders, we also begin

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:10%
to understand why, for
the past 400 years,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:10%
new circular temples
have manifested

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:10%
beside these sacred
spaces-- the crop circles.

These mysterious signatures of
attracted hundreds of thousands

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%

from near and far

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.651 align:middle line:84%

perception of spirit.

And just like our ancestors
thousands of years ago,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
they, too, feel
motivated to connect

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:90%
with the invisible universe.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible a
relationship exists

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.418 align:middle line:90%
between all these temples?

syndicate's view that use

connected then with

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:10%

sights of veneration.

worship at sacred

But who or what is it altering?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, most
church altars were

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.735 align:middle line:84%
build over a slab of red
granite, a rock containing

00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
a very high amount of quartz, a
formidable conductor of energy.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The same technique was

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.034 align:middle line:84%
of power in temples, such as
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly the rock used for
altars was not of local origin.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
As with the greenstone
altar at Stonehenge,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
it was transported from

any connection

Five, the pentagram,

with positive and
negative polarity,

Cathedrals, such as those
at Litchfield and Chartres,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:10%
were built with two unequal
spires, each encoding

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:10%
the mathematics of the moon, the
female principle, and the sun,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:10%
the male principle.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:10%
By their very nature, the spires
create two slightly different

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:10%
axes, which in turn generate a
vibrato effect on the residents

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:10%
inside the cathedral.

Gregorian chant was the
preferred style of pop music,

that superseded them.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the assimilation
of sacred sites

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
had been much more than
a symbolic gesture.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.861 align:middle line:90%

[WATER FLOWING]

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Despite all the knowledge
and skill that clearly went

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
into the Gothic cathedrals,
the builders seemingly

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
overlooked the fact
that their creations

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
were build on architecturally
unsuitable terrain-- water.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Or did they?

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Could water be vital to the
overall effect that buildings

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
were designed to generate,
another ingredient

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.518 align:middle line:90%
in this spiritual technology?

00:21:54.518 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The water in holy wells carries
a substantially different

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
frequency than ordinary water.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, a temple would
be erected beside a holy well

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to honor the water and
it's beneficial properties.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.994 align:middle line:84%
One such site survived
in England, later

00:22:17.994 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
superimposed by a
fine Gothic cathedral

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and appropriately named Wells.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most sacred sites,
like the neolithic mound

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.077 align:middle line:84%
of Silbury Hill, sit
on top of springs

00:22:37.077 --> 00:22:38.043 align:middle line:90%
or underground water courses.

00:22:38.043 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
This conical mound even
resembles a coiled spiral,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.104 align:middle line:84%
a suggestion that
form follows function,

00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
drawing and anchoring the energy
of the invisible universe.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Like the ancient mounds,
the water below cathedrals

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%
lies barely four feet
below their flaxen floors.

[WATER RUSHING]

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Water is both a
conductor of energy

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
and a memory storage device.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It can also carry an
electromagnetic charge.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:84%
This is generated by the
spiral movement of energy.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
From a spiral comes
the word "spire."

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.151 align:middle line:84%
And so it is not by
chance that spires

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:84%
are located above the focal
point of the water courses

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.534 align:middle line:90%
they stand upon.

00:23:44.114 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Spiral motion is nature's most
efficient movement of energy.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.796 align:middle line:84%
We are reminded of it every
day, even in the heavens.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This notion is so
fundamental to life

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that without it,
blood could not move

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.218 align:middle line:90%
through the veins of the body.

00:24:03.218 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors were well aware
of the importance of spin,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and they carved this
understanding in stone chambers

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Latter-day experiments
have shown that sound takes

on the form of spirals inside
these smoke-filled chambers,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
particularly at points where
the rock carvings appear.

00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Some even resemble the waves
on a modern oscilloscope.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's as if our predecessors left
the instructions in the stone.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
These chambers were also built
to specific geometric ratios

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and tuned to musical notes.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Because sound was
instrumental in ceremony,

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
these sacred spaces
were essentially

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
built as tuned
resonant cavities,

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
just like the Gothic
cathedrals 3,000 years later.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And the effect on the

particularly in healing and
heightened state of awareness,

00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:90%
are profound.

Yet the spiral

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
is not restricted to stone
chambers and churches,

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
for the spiral is
also the foundation

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.492 align:middle line:84%

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And not just any old spiral,
but the mathematical ratio

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
behind every living organism,
including the human body,

Could the crop

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.475 align:middle line:90%
these same natural laws?

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Seen three-dimensionally,
the spiral

This primary movement in
the generation of matter

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
underlies the

And if you were to
slice it like an orange,

In their study of the
planets, the ancients

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
noticed something else-- how
an invisible glue enabled

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
each of the planets
to relate to one

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:90%
another in a harmonious way.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
When they calculated the
mean orbits of the planets,

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
they realized this
order was based

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
on orderly geometric
relationships,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and they called it
sacred geometry,

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
for it indeed reflected the
order of the world of the gods.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The ancients deduced
that to bring the harmony

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:84%
of the heavy machinery of the
gods into the physical world

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:84%
was to anchor on Earth
the benefits that

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
came with an orderly universe.

throughout their temples.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Each sacred site was

specific resonant environments.

In other words, the rocks
were both conductors

and storage devices of energy.

00:31:06.842 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
They were erected throughout
the world by the thousand

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and programmed by
master craftsman

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.726 align:middle line:84%
as antennas for tuning in
to the invisible universe.

00:31:22.726 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Modern dowsers have discovered
how these stones, indeed

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
all sacred spaces,
mark the crossroads

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.597 align:middle line:84%
of invisible yet measurable
pathways with magnetic energy.

00:31:36.597 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Dowsing is one of the
most ancient of crafts.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It has even been used
with great success

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
by the military to locate
missing submarines,

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and oil companies have
employed dowsers to locate

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:90%
underground deposits of oil.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.670 align:middle line:90%
So clearly something works.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
stones' positioning

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:84%
along these pathways of
energy, magnetic anomalies

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
are frequent at these
locations, and they

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
often interfere with electrical
equipment and compasses.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
There have even been
reports of missing

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.880 align:middle line:84%
time, which may
be a distortion of

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:90%
the local gravitational field.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
These stones also produce
ultrasonic frequencies.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Such frequencies, above
the human hearing range,

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:84%
are today used in
hospitals to heal the sick.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What is significant is
that both ultrasound

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetism,
particularly

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:84%
at very high frequencies,
can influence

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
brain waves, which facilitates
heightened states of awareness.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Since the ancient temples have
rich traditions of healing

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and altered states, we can begin
to appreciate why people went

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of trouble
to erect these stones

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.438 align:middle line:84%
and why they resisted all the
attempts to outlaw their use.

00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:90%
But there's another surprise.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Dowsing maps of sacred
sites reveal that the energy

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:90%
also radiates like ripples.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship
of these ripples

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in the same
organized geometric forms found

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship
of the orbits

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.935 align:middle line:90%
of planets-- sacred geometry.

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Since this geometry is inherent
in the design of churches

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and Gothic cathedrals,
and many stand

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
upon ancient sacred
sites, we can now

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.840 align:middle line:84%
see how these places of worship
stand upon the same transfers

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It gives their cruciform
shape a whole new meaning.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:10%
The very position of the
walls, the chambers, and most

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:10%
importantly the
entrances were designed

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.150 align:middle line:10%
to harness the invisible
energy pathways

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.410 align:middle line:10%
flowing through the land.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:10%
The meandering lines of energy
converge at the ultimate focus

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:10%
of worship, that
very power spot once

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:10%
occupied by an ancient mound
or standing stone, the altar.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Magnetism, water, geometry,
and sound-- all these systems

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:84%
combined to create
an environment that

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.820 align:middle line:84%
influences that most finely
tuned resonant cavity

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:90%
of all, the human body.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:41.542 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
By creating an
ambient environment

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of sympathetic resonance,
the temple builders

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
facilitated a better connection
with the unseen worlds,

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:84%
for when the physical body is
in close contact with spirit,

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:90%
it is essentially whole.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Or in the context of the
space where they stand,

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:90%
they are indeed holy.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
sacred space takes

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.175 align:middle line:90%
on many forms and functions.

00:35:42.175 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:84%
These stairways to heaven
harness a combination

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of natural laws that
elevate our state of being.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Recently, a new kind of temple
has appeared in the landscape.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Although they gained
prominence in the media

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:84%
during the late 1980s,
the crop circles

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:21.180 align:middle line:90%
can be traced back to 1680.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Written records of
the time describe

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
an event of an
uncanny similarity

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.410 align:middle line:90%
to the latter-day phenomenon.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Even in 1890, eyewitnesses saw
the mysterious circles manifest

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of
seconds, just as others

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.873 align:middle line:90%
have done in the modern era.

00:36:38.873 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:84%
In genuine crop
circles, the plants

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:84%
are bent just above the
soil without damage,

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:84%
an incredible feat when it
occurs in the thick and brittle

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.888 align:middle line:90%
stems of maize or canola.

00:36:57.888 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.102 align:middle line:84%
There is a superficial
charring of the stems.

00:37:06.102 --> 00:37:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And the soil inside the
circles can be bone-dry

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:84%
while outside it remains wet,
suggesting that an intense heat

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.966 align:middle line:90%
is used in the process.

00:37:18.966 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Under the microscope,
the affected plants

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.507 align:middle line:84%
show how their chromosomes
have been altered.

00:37:30.507 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Soil samples, too,
reveal an energy

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that generated temperatures in
excess of 500 degrees Celsius

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:90%
in a fraction of a second.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This was enough to alter the
soil's crystalline structure.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Such effects can be generated
by the controlled use

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.755 align:middle line:84%
of ultrasonic
frequencies, the kind

00:37:55.755 --> 00:37:57.660 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies
measured at standing

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:90%
stones and stone circles.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:84%
There have even been sightings
of unusual balls of light

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
in and around crop circles, just
like the ones often described

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in folklore, which
appear at oracles

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:90%
and other sacred spaces.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Clearly such
evidence points away

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:84%
from humans as the originators
of the crop circles.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Like churches, cathedrals,
and other sacred spaces,

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
crop circles have a rich
history of people experiencing

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:90%
heightened states of awareness.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds
of cases of healings.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:84%
One person experienced
the complete disappearance

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.262 align:middle line:84%
of a malignant eye tumor after
contact with the designs.

00:38:53.262 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the geometry is
causing such effects.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
As with any sacred
space, crop circles often

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:84%
conceal an invisible
network of encoded geometry,

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and such shapes resonate
with the human body,

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:90%
even its state of awareness.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.071 align:middle line:84%
In nature, geometry is
a physical manifestation

00:39:16.071 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:23.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
In the mid 1990,
it was discovered

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that around the perimeter
of crop circles,

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
there exists an energy field,
a kind of shielding device,

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and its frequency
registers in the millions

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of vibrations per second.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it seems
to occupy a range

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.640 align:middle line:90%
between 260 to 320 megahertz.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It has also been noted that the
crop circles, like their stone

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.020 align:middle line:84%
predecessors, are not only
appearing at the crossroads

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:84%
of invisible yet measurable
pathways of magnetic energy,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:84%
but these pathways are
connected to local sacred sites.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.677 align:middle line:90%


00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
ripples of energy

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that vibrate around
standing stones,

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the crop circles, too, generate
their own organized energy

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.040 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Such energy fields are
invisible harmonic extensions

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:90%
of the physical design.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And the spatial arrangement
of these ripples

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with the
principles of sacred geometry.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
crop circles are

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:84%
living organisms, physical
expressions of living energy.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:90%
But what type of energy?

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this journey,
we have discovered

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.200 align:middle line:84%
how sound was a main element
of the spiritual technology

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of the ancients.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is the one
fundamental principle

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.270 align:middle line:90%
on which all religions agree.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Sound is a prime creative force.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Sound drives molecules
in their frantic spin.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It is inherent in the ratios
of the orbits of the planets.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It can even bring down
the walls of Jericho.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:84%
In crop circles,
the clues constantly

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:90%
point to sound as a source.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:84%
These come in various guises,
such as the dowsing energy

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:90%
map around the crop circle.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the relationship
between the physical design

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and its surrounding
energy field is defined

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:84%
by an equilateral
triangle, a three-to-one,

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
which in musical terms
is a double octave.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the clues lie
in the shapes themselves.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, the stems are bent
six inches from the top,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:84%
creating the unmistakable
shape of a cymatic pattern.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics is the study
of sound as it interacts

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.490 align:middle line:90%
with physical substances.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Its most famous recent pupil was
the Swiss scientist Hans Jenny,

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
whose experiments
throughout the 1960s

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.037 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate how the energy of
sound physicalizes in geometric

00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:19.736 align:middle line:90%
shapes.

00:42:19.736 --> 00:42:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, he helped humanity
to visualize frozen music.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Low frequencies created
simple circles and rings.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But when the frequencies
rose or combined,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.963 align:middle line:84%
so the complexity of
the shapes increased.

00:42:40.963 --> 00:42:45.600 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, this is
exactly what is now occurring

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:90%
in fields around the world.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Simple crop circles
in the early 1980s

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
gave way to new and
increasingly complex designs.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And as with laboratory
experiments,

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies
detected inside crop

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.060 align:middle line:84%
circles are rising relative to
the complexity of their design.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:14.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Sound can have a profound
effect on the human body,

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.390 align:middle line:90%
and so, too, can crop circles.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:84%
This is because all the
atoms in the human body

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.210 align:middle line:84%
are in a constant
state of vibration.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, both the
body and brain waves

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.230 align:middle line:84%
can be influenced by any
excitation of the local energy

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
field that they
interact with, exactly

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.636 align:middle line:84%
as we find in a Gothic
cathedral or a stone chamber.

00:43:46.636 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The human body contains
a range of frequencies.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And amid this range, there
is a gap, a place where

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:04.140 align:middle line:90%
the body appears to be silent.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:84%
This range occurs between
260 to 300 megahertz,

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and it is the same range
predominant in crop circles.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:19.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Given that more and more people
are experiencing heightened

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.220 align:middle line:84%
states of awareness
in crop circles,

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
could these patterns be
the new sacred spaces?

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We are, after all,
electromagnetic beings.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic
fields in crop circles

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.142 align:middle line:84%
is known to deviate
by several degrees.

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:41.877 align:middle line:84%
The effects sometimes makes the
plants' roots flow horizontally

00:44:41.877 --> 00:44:42.610 align:middle line:90%
instead of vertically.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.670 align:middle line:84%
If such a concept
seems speculative,

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
consider that when this unusual
crop circle appeared in 1991,

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:84%
the breaks along
the snaking pattern

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.910 align:middle line:84%
were found to match
the strategic breaks

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:84%
in human DNA, which are
unused, or waiting to be coded.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that these new
temples are waking something

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:90%
in our genetic memory?

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The concept of crop circles
as an input of energy

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.810 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth itself also seems
feasible when they manifest

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
upon the node of the Earth's
magnetic pathways of energy,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:84%
once again mimicking the way
our ancestors located and built

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.348 align:middle line:90%
the altars of their temples.

00:45:30.348 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Just how much of an
effect the crop circles

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.810 align:middle line:84%
are having on the Earth
and human consciousness

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:90%
remains to be seen.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.060 align:middle line:90%
But one thing is certain.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Like sacred spaces,
all crop circles share

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.010 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with water.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.860 align:middle line:84%
They manifest over or near large
sources of underground water.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And after their
appearance, the local soil

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is depleted of
millions of gallons,

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.120 align:middle line:90%
as seen in this infrared image.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
This may be an indicator
of the intense heat

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:08.995 align:middle line:84%
generated by sound frequencies
below the human hearing range.

00:46:08.995 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.865 align:middle line:84%
Since crop circles are
founded on the spiral

00:46:15.865 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and spin generates an
electromagnetic field in water,

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
it is worth pointing out
that such a process can

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.605 align:middle line:90%
imprint information in water.

00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And samples taken
from crop circles

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.050 align:middle line:84%
show that the water
has indeed been coded.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Water is capable
of storing memory,

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:84%
even when the original coding
is diluted millions of times.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.200 align:middle line:84%
This has serious implications,
because 90% of the world's crop

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:84%
circles appear across
southern England

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and above the world's
deepest chalk aquifer.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:58.240 align:middle line:10%
If the crop circles
are coding the water,

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.190 align:middle line:10%
the information is
filtering into the aquifer,

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.470 align:middle line:10%
into the streams,
the rivers, the seas,

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately the oceans.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And since the oceans occupy
2/3 of the body of the plant,

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
consider how they might be
transforming the human body,

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.154 align:middle line:90%
which itself is also 2/3 water.

00:47:52.734 --> 00:47:56.410 align:middle line:84%
By locating an appropriate spot
on the landscape where lines

00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:00.465 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic energy cross, it
is possible to create a temple,

00:48:00.465 --> 00:48:02.820 align:middle line:84%
an environment where
one can connect

with subtle forces which are
fundamental in our lives.

sound, and stone,

and you create a sympathetic
effect on the human body

Unlike many of us today, they
shared an intimate relationship

and how to harness them.
