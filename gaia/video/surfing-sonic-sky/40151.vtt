1
00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:15.264
(quiet, pensive music gradually increasing in volume)

2
00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:05.481
(atonal piano music)

3
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:10.350
(pulsing)

4
00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:23.953
<v ->Everything had been fine,</v>

5
00:01:23.953 --> 00:01:26.033
sailing along smoothly in my career

6
00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.573
writing music for TV and film.

7
00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:31.673
And I really thought I had a handle on music.

8
00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.253
Then, bam, something happened.
(chaotic music)

9
00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:36.673
And I suddenly saw life through a different filter.

10
00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:40.453
New sounds, new colors, new shades of feeling.

11
00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:42.733
I'd entered a parallel dimension of sorts,

12
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.433
one much larger than the one we're in now,

13
00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.793
a universe that includes this one,

14
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:49.413
yet goes beyond it.

15
00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:51.593
Here's how it all happened.

16
00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:54.374
I was walking along the path

17
00:01:54.374 --> 00:01:57.034
and I poked my head around the bend a little bit

18
00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.454
trying to see what might lie ahead in the future of music.

19
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.814
When I came upon a man by the side of the trail.

20
00:02:03.814 --> 00:02:06.594
I found out later he was a sonic sorcerer,

21
00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:08.814
but I didn't know that at the time.

22
00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:11.434
He called himself Ervin McDonald Wilson,

23
00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:14.374
and I said, "Hey, I think I've heard about you."

24
00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:17.914
He said, "Come here, I wanna show you something."

25
00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:21.804
And what he showed me, over the next 20 years,

26
00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:25.734
blasted open a port to a vast universe

27
00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.465
that very few even know exists.

28
00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.115
Some of what you might hear there

29
00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:32.915
can sound something like this.

30
00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:37.735
(atonal music)

31
00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:39.795
In fact, much of the music you will be hearing

32
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:41.955
in the background from here on out,

33
00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.316
will be nuggets of sonic gold,

34
00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:47.616
extracted from different planets within this sonic,

35
00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:49.966 line:15% 
will sonic, universe.

36
00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:52.916
I came to find out that amongst the handful of people

37
00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:54.736
who had also caught a glimpse

38
00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:57.716
of this infinitely creative realm he'd opened up,

39
00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:00.696
nobody knew how to explain it in plain English.

40
00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:03.976
They could explain the individual fruits of his labor,

41
00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:06.356
but all had great difficulty explaining

42
00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:08.516
the tree they came from,

43
00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:11.176
or the orchard, or the region, or the state.

44
00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:14.256
Any kind of simple overview explaining what he does,

45
00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:17.257
how it's different and why anyone should care.

46
00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:19.157
So about five years ago I got together

47
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.257
with a couple of other guys who write music,

48
00:03:21.257 --> 00:03:23.297
Gary David, a jazz musician

49
00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:25.637
with a doctorate in philosophy,

50
00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:29.068
who studied with Erv back in the 1960s,

51
00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.868
and Marcus Hobbs, a techno composer,

52
00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:34.608
computer programmer, who studied with him

53
00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:36.538
in the late 90s.

54
00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:41.548
Turns out, it took us this long, five years,

55
00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:45.428
to come up with a simple way to break it all down for you.

56
00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:47.598
And we went down a rabbit hole.

57
00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:50.668
Looking at his work through the lens of philosophy,

58
00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:53.948
art, acoustics, psychology, emotion, mathematics.

59
00:03:53.948 --> 00:03:55.528
I traveled across the country

60
00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:57.448
interviewing an astro-biologist,

61
00:03:57.448 --> 00:04:00.308
a healer that uses unusual musical frequencies,

62
00:04:00.308 --> 00:04:02.648
instrument makers, composers, dancers,

63
00:04:02.648 --> 00:04:05.788
musicians with perfect pitch, a heavy metal guitarist,

64
00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:10.088
all these people profoundly influenced by Erv Wilson.

65
00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:13.148
So in this intro, we're going to do just this,

66
00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:16.068
one, explain who Erv Wilson is

67
00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:17.628
and exactly what he does,

68
00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:20.168
two, how his work is a ground breaking,

69
00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:22.388
game changing musical innovation,

70
00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:25.769
and three, why this stuff is just so damn cool.

71
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:29.769
(upbeat techno music)

72
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.749
Okay, so what does Erv Wilson do?

73
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.229
In a nutshell, he sculpts with numbers.

74
00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.129
But that's only the beginning.

75
00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.889
He devises ingenious, almost magical ways

76
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.350
to create extended families of new musical frequencies.

77
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.351
He then often takes these new notes

78
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:50.170
and maps them onto three dimensional objects like this

79
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.430
so we can see all the ways

80
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.590
the notes are connected to each other.

81
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.950
Another words, he works with numbers

82
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.850
to uncover musical notes

83
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.310
you can't find on a regular instrument like the piano.

84
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.810
Because the new notes would literally

85
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.310
fall between the cracks.

86
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.350
And you'd have to build a new kind of piano

87
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.411
with lots of extra keys to be able to hear them.

88
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:14.692
Kinda like the one here he designed with 810 keys.

89
00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:17.892
Actually, in order to explain the scope and level

90
00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:20.332
on which he operates, we found it helpful

91
00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:22.292
to construct this physical model

92
00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:24.932
to use as a rough analogy of music.

93
00:05:24.932 --> 00:05:28.272
Not to interpreted too literally, but take a look at it

94
00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:29.552
and tell me what you think.

95
00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:34.012
(bright techno music)

96
00:05:34.012 --> 00:05:36.453
Think of music as a three story building.

97
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:40.413
Ground floor, 2nd floor, 3rd floor

98
00:05:40.413 --> 00:05:42.814
and a skylight to the heavens.

99
00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:44.994
Now these floors only represent

100
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.074
where our attention is at any given moment.

101
00:05:48.074 --> 00:05:51.005
They are arenas of attention.

102
00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:54.695
No one floor is any better than another,

103
00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:57.116
because in music they all have to work together

104
00:05:57.116 --> 00:06:00.817 line:15% 
at the same time as layers of awareness.

105
00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:03.517 line:15% 
More like a cake than a hierarchy.

106
00:06:03.517 --> 00:06:06.017
Except for the 3rd floor, and we'll get to that.

107
00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:08.537
But suffice it to say, if we spend too much time

108
00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:11.357
on any one floor, to the neglect of the others,

109
00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:13.357
the experience becomes barren,

110
00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:15.497
with music that's either too abstract

111
00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:17.177
or not interesting enough.

112
00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.477
It gets stuck.

113
00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.157
Okay, so let's walk into the building

114
00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:22.017
and see what's going on in there.

115
00:06:22.017 --> 00:06:24.097
The first floor has this massive room

116
00:06:24.097 --> 00:06:27.068
where all of music is consumed.

117
00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:31.138
This ground level is the place of pure feeling.

118
00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:33.118
what goes on inside your body and soul

119
00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:35.729
when you hear or perform a piece of music,

120
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.729
This is the place where music is played and listened to.

121
00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.650
That's it.

122
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.229
Concerts happen here, iPods operate here,

123
00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.449
dancing happens here.

124
00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.049
Music is simply taken in.

125
00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:49.549 line:15% 
It's not intellectual, technical or symbolic.

126
00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:51.260 line:15% 
It's just a party.

127
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:55.290 line:15% 
The bulk of our attention here is on the sensation of music,

128
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.221 line:15% 
as it flows by.

129
00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:58.652 line:15% 
If this were a restaurant,

130
00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:01.511
you could say the food is served and eaten here.

131
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:03.602
It's where the feast happens.

132
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:06.711
This is the level of musical reality.

133
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:09.933
That is, happening where it counts, in real time.

134
00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:11.692
Bound to the earth.

135
00:07:11.692 --> 00:07:15.132
Most music fans have a great time just hanging out here.

136
00:07:15.132 --> 00:07:16.662
In fact, why ever leave?

137
00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.043
Well, if you want to know something

138
00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:21.843
about how the music you consume here is made,

139
00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:24.784
then you need to scoot up the ladder to the 2nd floor.

140
00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:26.635
(ascending musical arpeggio)

141
00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:29.195
<v Voiceover>The 2nd floor is only for</v>

142
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:31.777
those who thirst for more than the first.

143
00:07:31.777 --> 00:07:33.567
<v Voiceover>This is where recipes are created.</v>

144
00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:36.647
Composers live here, music theory people,

145
00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:38.647
technical people, instrument makers,

146
00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:40.586
anyone who works in patterns

147
00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:44.046
or relationships of notes or rhythms.

148
00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.866
This is the level where musical rules

149
00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.767
are devised and followed,

150
00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.266
where those who create music

151
00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:52.846
decide what goes well with what.

152
00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:56.268
What chords fit together, what notes can be combined

153
00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:59.878
into a tasty melody to be served up on the first floor.

154
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.019
They're like chefs conjuring up recipes.

155
00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.179
In fact, the act of composition usually consists

156
00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:07.580
of jumping back and forth

157
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.959
between the 2nd floor of pattern making

158
00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:12.181 line:15% 
and the 1st floor of sensation.

159
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:13.661
They have to work together

160
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:16.981
for the music to be emotional and interesting,

161
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:19.202
kind of like a left brain, right brain thing.

162
00:08:19.202 --> 00:08:20.781
But not exactly.

163
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.961
The excitement felt here on the 2nd floor

164
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.961
comes mainly from placing the attention

165
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:27.502
on cool patterns and note relationships.

166
00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:30.121
For more musicians, composers and listeners,

167
00:08:30.121 --> 00:08:33.582
these two floors provide a lifetime of fun.

168
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:37.641
This much in and of itself may seem fairly complete.

169
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:40.492
Except, what's on the 3rd floor?

170
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:44.304
Well, if we walk up the ladder, we'll see at first

171
00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:46.804
not much appears to be going on up there.

172
00:08:46.804 --> 00:08:50.155
In fact, it's fairly empty and quiet.

173
00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:53.535
<v Voiceover>The 3rd floor is a mystery.</v>

174
00:08:54.645 --> 00:08:57.525
That very few bother to see.

175
00:08:58.914 --> 00:08:59.995
<v Voiceover>This is the realm</v>

176
00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:02.295
where the master set of ingredients

177
00:09:02.295 --> 00:09:06.654
sits on its throne in what we call the tuning system,

178
00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:09.064
or master scale.

179
00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:11.795
In the case of American and European music,

180
00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:14.095
we're talking about the 12 notes on the piano,

181
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.375
from C natural to the C above it.

182
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.865
And then they start all over again from C to C.

183
00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:23.615
In the West, all songs, symphonies, chords, melodies,

184
00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:26.615
in fact any pattern derived on our 2nd floor,

185
00:09:26.615 --> 00:09:29.554
is made from these 12 notes

186
00:09:29.554 --> 00:09:32.075
as they beam down and permeate everything,

187
00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:33.955
regardless of musical style,

188
00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:36.366
whether rock, classical, jazz, whatever.

189
00:09:36.695 --> 00:09:38.596
Those 12 notes in the master set

190
00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:41.556
are the only ones allowed to pass below

191
00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:43.656
where they get recycled, recombined

192
00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:46.555
and reordered on the 2nd floor to form new songs

193
00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:49.076
that are served up for consumption on the first.

194
00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:52.316
But very few songwriters, musicians or composers

195
00:09:52.316 --> 00:09:55.316
ever question where these 12 notes came from

196
00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:57.696
and why they deserve the privileged status

197
00:09:57.696 --> 00:10:00.975
of being the only frequencies allowed to pass their DNA

198
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.955
down to the 2nd and 1st floors.

199
00:10:02.955 --> 00:10:05.076
When actually, truth be told,

200
00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:08.075
there are in infinite number of alternate frequencies

201
00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:10.136
and frequency relationships with which

202
00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:12.526
brand new music can be written.

203
00:10:13.316 --> 00:10:15.816
Composers that work with this wider choice of notes

204
00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:17.516
are called microtonalists.

205
00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.776
And they spend a lotta time up here.

206
00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:21.836
It's a different kinda kitchen.

207
00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:25.350
The attention here is focused on the system itself

208
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.240
and the context in which everything below happens.

209
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.302
Assumptions get examined here.

210
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.872
On this floor the imagination goes wild

211
00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:37.532
in a jungle of numbers which then become

212
00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:41.072
highly structured and converted into a tuning system.

213
00:10:42.252 --> 00:10:43.512
Excitement here is generated

214
00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:45.892
by creating new tonal ingredients

215
00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:48.931
that get kicked down to the chefs on the 2nd floor,

216
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.032
who can then cook up cool note patterns

217
00:10:51.032 --> 00:10:53.432
that will evoke new shades of feeling

218
00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:55.232
when performed on the 1st floor.

219
00:10:55.232 --> 00:10:57.792
(percussive piano playing)

220
00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:02.762
Okay, but what about the skylight above the 3rd floor?

221
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:07.442
<v Voiceover>The sky is vast and full of stars.</v>

222
00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:09.791
<v ->If you gaze through the skylight</v>

223
00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:11.892
for even a short length of time,

224
00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:13.592
you'll go blind.

225
00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:16.312
There are too many stars for the eyes to take in.

226
00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:19.191
Their collective light is just too bright.

227
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.092
Hence we need Venetian blinds on our skylight

228
00:11:23.092 --> 00:11:26.732
to let in only the light of a select few stars.

229
00:11:26.732 --> 00:11:29.572
Our brains would explode without such a filtering process

230
00:11:29.572 --> 00:11:34.132
that enables us to take small, manageable bites of light.

231
00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:36.892
So now think of each of those zillion stars

232
00:11:36.892 --> 00:11:39.992
as having its own distinct musical note.

233
00:11:39.992 --> 00:11:42.872
If they came at us all at once, we'd be hit

234
00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:45.592
with an incoherent blast of noise.

235
00:11:46.632 --> 00:11:49.692
So what has evolved over time

236
00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:51.692
is that each culture or subculture

237
00:11:51.692 --> 00:11:54.692
has gradually settled on a particular number of blinds

238
00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:58.212
and also on the distance between each blind.

239
00:11:58.212 --> 00:12:02.402
In the West we have 12 equally spaced blinds.

240
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:10.542
In India they have 22 unequally spaced blinds.

241
00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:21.194
In Indonesia they cut infinity into seven unequal pieces,

242
00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:24.404
with each village determining their own spacing.

243
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:29.673
Any master set will permeate the DNA of all music below,

244
00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:31.633
regardless of style.

245
00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:32.794
Watch this.

246
00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:36.074
I'm gonna play one single musical gesture,

247
00:12:36.074 --> 00:12:40.074
a pattern of notes that cascade down from high to low.

248
00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:42.433
The only difference each time I play it

249
00:12:42.433 --> 00:12:45.733
will be the swapping out of the master scale.

250
00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:48.914
Notice what that does to the genetic character of the music.

251
00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:53.684
(fast paced repeating music in different musical keys)

252
00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:09.854
What you're seeing operate here is a filtering process.

253
00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:11.954
Because once we deny the existence

254
00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.655
of everything but those few rays of light

255
00:13:14.655 --> 00:13:16.595
that get filtered through the blinds,

256
00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:20.035
we tend to forget all about the other stars in the sky.

257
00:13:20.035 --> 00:13:22.454
They disappear from our awareness.

258
00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:26.054
That filter becomes mistaken for reality itself

259
00:13:26.054 --> 00:13:28.854
as the rays of light eventually burnish themselves

260
00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:31.425
into the floor at level three.

261
00:13:31.835 --> 00:13:33.874
Then the culture comes to treat them

262
00:13:33.874 --> 00:13:35.615
as if they were always there,

263
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.155
in the fabric of reality itself.

264
00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:39.935
But actually, it's just a product

265
00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:41.975
of our own filtering system.

266
00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:45.236
We create the Venetian blinds within us.

267
00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:48.196
And hence, are not separate from them.

268
00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:51.747
In fact, let me revise the previous point.

269
00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:56.918
By saying now, that it is not so much our filters

270
00:13:56.918 --> 00:13:58.498
that create the illusion,

271
00:13:58.498 --> 00:14:02.798
but that the filtering process itself is a creative act,

272
00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:05.709
inseparable from perception.

273
00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.199
Hence we can embrace it for what it is,

274
00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:11.238
a creative activity to have some fun with.

275
00:14:11.238 --> 00:14:14.459
And this is where Erv Wilson comes in.

276
00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:16.499
Not only is he a microtonalist,

277
00:14:16.499 --> 00:14:19.239
but he is one that has found a way to poke his head

278
00:14:19.239 --> 00:14:21.258
through the skylight.

279
00:14:21.258 --> 00:14:24.980
And when he did that, he saw galaxies.

280
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.940
Galaxies of new musical pitch fields,

281
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.340
held together in coherent relationships

282
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.820
by the gravity of simple arithmetic.

283
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.039
(atonal music)

284
00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.320
He was thus able to map large swaths of the sky,

285
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.260
charting new constellations of notes

286
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.560
that nobody knew about before.

287
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.160
He noted the unique properties

288
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.820
of many of these star clusters and by doing so,

289
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.800
laid the foundation by which our previous understanding

290
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.629
can be placed into a larger matrix of pitch organization.

291
00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:01.720
To get an idea of how vast this tuning universe is,

292
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.260
take a look at this computerized visualization

293
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.320
Marcus Hobbs did of one of Wilson's galaxy clusters

294
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.230
he calls Moments of Symmetry.

295
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.880
You're looking at an infinite pitch field

296
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.740
in which our 12 tone master scale is a mere speck.

297
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.300
Kind of like how our beloved Earth is a mere dot

298
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.490
within the larger cosmos.

299
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.860
You see, there is our system, right here.

300
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.440
That ring with 12 equally spaced cells dividing the circle.

301
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.760
(major scale played on piano)

302
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.180
But change one little number,

303
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.800
way to the right of the decimal point

304
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.100
in the formula that generates the radii,

305
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.820
and the whole cosmos changes right before your eyes.

306
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.079
And a new galaxy comes into being with nested master sets,

307
00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.639
each rendering a whole new set of tonal properties.

308
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:51.780
I'll demonstrate this

309
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.640
by repeating the same four notes on the keyboard

310
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.280
as the computer retunes those notes on the fly

311
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.860
as we morph from galaxy to galaxy.

312
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.750
(atonal music)

313
00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:15.880
There are so many of these sonic galaxies

314
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.739
in this cluster that you can't count them.

315
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:22.719
That's how big and fertile this area of exploration is.

316
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.501
So now we can finally answer the question,

317
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:29.460
who is Erv Wilson and why should we care?

318
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.081
He is a cartographer, like Mercator,

319
00:16:32.081 --> 00:16:34.521
a cosmologist like Stephen Hawking,

320
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.301
an epistimologist of pitch, like Pythagoras,

321
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:41.181
and an explorer like Magellan,

322
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:43.680
unveiling brand new horizons.

323
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.261
His work represents both discovery and invention.

324
00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:49.900
His work is also relevant to our understanding

325
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.861
or perception and how belief systems in general

326
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:56.152
function similarly to our tuning systems.

327
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.501
Much like Copernicus,

328
00:16:58.501 --> 00:17:01.121
who expanded our concept of the solar system,

329
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:04.262 line:15% 
by altering our understanding of how it actually operates,

330
00:17:04.262 --> 00:17:06.984 line:15% 
Erv Wilson has expanded our concept

331
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.744 line:15% 
of what can be done on the 3rd floor and above.

332
00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:11.884
The master set doesn't have to be

333
00:17:11.884 --> 00:17:15.763
a fixed or static noun, sitting on a throne,

334
00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:20.024
but a verb, that moves about freely within our awareness.

335
00:17:21.284 --> 00:17:23.925
With Wilson's imaginative use of number logic,

336
00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:26.365
a composer can now embrace the sonic sky

337
00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:29.483
in its totality and hence change the function

338
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:32.745
of the Venetian blinds from static to dynamic,

339
00:17:32.745 --> 00:17:34.665
where the blinds can change position

340
00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:37.325
as they logically morph from star to star

341
00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:41.925
along a continuum of Wilson's charted constellations.

342
00:17:41.925 --> 00:17:44.885
His work invites us to create and use

343
00:17:44.885 --> 00:17:48.385
master scales of notes, not as fixed values,

344
00:17:48.385 --> 00:17:50.285
but more like a moving, pulsating,

345
00:17:50.285 --> 00:17:52.705
electrical field of variables.

346
00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:56.625
By fulling accepting our ability

347
00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:59.745
to participate in the creation of the master set,

348
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.844
by understanding that each tuning system

349
00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:04.444
is merely a small planet within a large galaxy

350
00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:06.144
of related bodies,

351
00:18:06.144 --> 00:18:09.785
by changing it freely within a composition as we allow in

352
00:18:09.785 --> 00:18:12.445
the changing light of different stars,

353
00:18:12.445 --> 00:18:15.905
then the creative act is expanded

354
00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:19.405
to fully include the 3rd floor as well.

355
00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:21.325
To free this realm from rigidity

356
00:18:21.325 --> 00:18:25.006
amplifies the gene pool of music itself,

357
00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:27.925
fully integrates our layers of awareness,

358
00:18:27.925 --> 00:18:31.905
and enables the party to spread from the 1st floor

359
00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:34.986
all the way up to the sky.

360
00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:38.505
(ethereal tones)

361
00:18:38.505 --> 00:18:43.455 line:15% 
(upbeat techno music)

362
00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:09.941
<v ->Israelian child in an adobe house</v>

363
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:14.321
where I lived, they had rafters

364
00:20:14.321 --> 00:20:16.101
and there were little cracks in the rafters

365
00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:18.201
and the wind would come singing

366
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:19.841
through the cracks in the rafters

367
00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:22.061
and I could hear the wind singing

368
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:25.261
these beautiful, haunting melodies.

369
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:28.061
That were going up and down,

370
00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.221
or they were just weave in and out

371
00:20:30.221 --> 00:20:32.541
according to the strength and direction

372
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:34.881
of the wind through the rafters.

373
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:38.441
And that haunted me for the rest of my days.

374
00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:39.441
It still does.

375
00:20:39.441 --> 00:20:41.921
A lot of interesting musicians

376
00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:44.831
got started listening to the wind.
