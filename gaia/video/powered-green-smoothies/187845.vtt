00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello there.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to watch
this movie or what?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:90%
My name is Sergei.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm 29 years old and healthy
eating changed my life.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:84%
24 years ago when my
family immigrated to the US

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.170 align:middle line:84%
from Russia, we
ate a typical diet

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
rich in processed food, sugar,
wheat, meat, and fast food.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Within a few short
years, this lifestyle

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
led my mother,
father, sister, and I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to unhappiness,
sickness, and suffering.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully we were able to
turn it around and reclaim

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
our health by changing
our diet and adopting

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%
a healthier lifestyle.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Because of the persistence
of my Russian mother,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
we threw away that crap
food we had in our kitchen,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
smashed the microwave
with a hammer,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and started eating fresh
whole foods the way

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:90%
that nature intended.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
At the core of our success was
a simple yet powerful drink

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:90%
we refer to as green smoothie.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
If you are unfamiliar with
this concept, let me explain.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
A green smoothie
is a homemade drink

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
made from blended leafy
greens and fresh ripe fruit.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is bottled, pasteurized,
or otherwise altered.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
What you put in
the blender is what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
you get out of it, pure
nutrients that taste great.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
When you mixed greens
and fruits together,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
you create a perfect marriage
of delicious and nutritious.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
The fruit sugars counteract
the intense taste of the greens

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to intake
more vitamins, minerals,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and antioxidants than
you typically would

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:90%
on any given day.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
One cup of such a
smoothie contains

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
between five and seven servings
of fruits and vegetables.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840 align:middle line:84%
If you were to consume one quart
of this green liquid regularly,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you could potentially
drink 32 servings of health

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
This would supercharge you in
ways you can't even imagine.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Over the last decade, my mother
has written numerous books

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:90%
about green smoothies.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
She's also conducted over
20 week long green smoothie

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:90%
retreats.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
My involvement in all this
has further opened my eyes

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to the miraculous benefits that
can come from dietary change.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people
tackle everything

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
from diabetes to insomnia
simply by introducing

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:90%
more greens into their diet.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I am now beyond convinced
that if you have any health

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
problems, smoothies and whole
foods can help you immensely.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
The more transformations
I saw, the more

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I found myself becoming
curious about what effect

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
green smoothies would have
on seemingly healthy people,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.775 align:middle line:90%
specifically athletes.

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out if
green smoothies could

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
improve performance,
speed up recovery time,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and increase endurance.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Being very active myself, I
seem to have a surplus of energy

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
which allows me to
conquer mountains,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
surf for hours on end,
and dance salsa non-stop.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Yet I don't eat
pasta, drinks sports

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
drinks, or take
nutritional supplements.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Could this wealth
of energy be sourced

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
from my regular intake
of green smoothies

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
and fresh organic food?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And would my green smoothies
have the same effect

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:90%
on other athletic people?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I looked around the internet
for information on this subject,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
but didn't find any
studies in this area.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
conduct a study myself.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
If smoothies could improve
athletic performance,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I wanted solid proof.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I rounded up 10 of my
most active friends

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and convinced them to drink
my homemade green smoothies

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
for six weeks in the middle
of their training schedules.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I made sure that
the folks I selected

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:90%
were healthy to begin with.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
After I collected all of
the initial baseline data

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
about my athletes,
they were instructed

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
not to change anything
about their diet, lifestyle,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
or exercise routine,
except for the addition

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
of one quart of
smoothie every day

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
for the duration of six weeks.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
In this way, I could
monitor their progress

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and see if my smoothies
had any positive effects.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It is important to note
that all of my athletes

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
ate a more or less
traditional diet.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
None of them were
vegetarian or vegan.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm aware, nobody has
conducted such an experiment

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So sit back, relax, and
see what happens when you

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.778 align:middle line:90%
get powered by green smoothies.

00:03:46.778 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:90%

I'm 31 years old.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Since my budget only allowed
for a small sample size,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I was determined to do
everything in my power

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to accurately conduct, monitor,
and record the progress of this

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
After I confirmed who
was going to partake,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I put them through a
rigorous interview process

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to collect as much
data as possible.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
How much do you exercise?

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I exercise approximately,
depending on the day,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
three to five hours a day.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I do CrossFit about five
or six days a week and about

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
an hour a day.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I also dance on top of
that four to five hours a day,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:90%
five days a week.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The types of sports that I
do regularly is pretty much just

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:90%
running and lifting weights.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I run about 60 miles
a week in six days

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and the longest running
I've ever done was 36 miles.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What challenges do you
experience as an athlete?

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> My biggest challenges have
been pain and injury and weight

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
loss.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I tend to put on muscle mass
really fast or fat really fast,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
depending if I'm training
enough during the week or not.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The challenge I experience is
a little time related and just

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:90%
fatigue.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I work construction
during the day.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So in the evenings, which is
the time I have to work out,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I have less energy and sometimes
kind of hydration problems.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to stay hydrated
and have enough energy

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the
level of performance

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
that I want for the workout.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting enough sleep.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't sleep all
that great, so I

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
would say it's a big challenge.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I tend to fatigue quickly.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I have had knee
surgery five years ago,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%
longer than that now.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to act up
on occasion when I run,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:90%
especially when I notice that.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your prediction for
this project and do you have

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:90%
any fears?

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't have any fears.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure how much
difference will be noticeable

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.267 align:middle line:90%
in such a short amount of time.

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have any fears.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually really excited.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
I generally try to follow a
kind of paleolithic style diet

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and I've been really between
owning a CrossFit gym

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and working two other
jobs, and then trying

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to get my own
training in, sometimes

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I find that I either don't eat
or that the content of what

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I eat tends to be
not the most ideal.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have any fears or
concerns about the project.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that it will
make me feel healthier.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Overall I feel pretty
positive about it.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how it
could hurt anything.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it increases my
performance, I'm all about it.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:90%
So, see what happens.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> My main supplements beer
I think that drinking a quart

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
of green smoothies that are
organic every day for six

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:84%
weeks, I don't see how it's
not going to at least partially

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:90%
improve my performance.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite being
fit and healthy,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I learned that my friends
battled with fatigue,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
slow recovery, sleep
irregularities,

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and frequent injuries
throughout their active lives.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And as for the
smoothies, the group

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
seemed excited to
start drinking them,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
but few were convinced
that these drinks would

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:84%
affect their
endurance and health

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:90%
in such a short amount of time.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
My personal hypothesis
is that you're

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
going to notice that you're
going to recover faster.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.945 align:middle line:84%
Your body's going to
hopefully work better.

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to feel
lighter on your feet.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, this will
make you more endurant.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when we feel
light it's easier to run,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
lift, swim, bike,
whatever you do.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Today we've got to make
a decision whether or not

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.547 align:middle line:90%
we're absolutely 100% in.

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
At this point I'm going to
start spending a lot of money

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.088 align:middle line:90%
on each and every one of you.

00:10:06.088 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'd rather know now
if you want to back out.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd be way less
offended now than later

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
on down the road.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.339 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this, one, two,
three, green smoothies!

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
In order to objectively
gauge whether or not

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
any benefits would come
from drinking smoothies,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I needed to find
a control group.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But how would I control
for green smoothies?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And what would my
placebo drink be?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
After struggling
with this dilemma,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I decided to check in with
several researchers at Southern

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Oregon University about
how to properly set up

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:90%
a control group.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I learned that as an
alternative to having

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
set of individuals

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
as my control group, I
could control my athletes

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
against themselves.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Because my athletes followed
both a consistent exercise

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and diet regimen, I could
collect their free smoothie

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
data and use that
information as my baseline.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
After six weeks of
green smoothie drinking,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I would put them through
the exact same tests

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and see if anything had changed.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Before I began, I
decided to check

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
in with several medical
and sports professionals

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to get some tips on how
best to conduct this study

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and how to track my progress.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm Geoff Houghton.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm a naturopathic physician,
practice here in Ashland.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a general practice.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I see people with
problems anything

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
from toenail fungus
to depression

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of
stuff in between.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I use natural medicine
when it is the best choice.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not dogmatic.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it
is, that there's

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:90%
no morality in biochemistry.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And so I use what works.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And generally
speaking, nutrition

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:90%
is a great method for treatment.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And so I use a lot of that.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But if I need to, yeah, I
pull out my drug handbook

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and write prescriptions,
because they work.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Nutrition obviously is one of
the foundations of good health.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to have high quality
nutrients going into the body.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what
you do with those

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
nutrients is also
very important.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
How well do you digest it?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%
How well do you absorb it?

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
There are many other fundamental
factors in good health

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
like sleep, like exercise,
how happy you are.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But nutrients are really
one of just the founding,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%
the basis of good health.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What types of health
markers should we test for?

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This study we discussed
different markers,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
what should we look at?

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
ideas we had were

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
looking at cholesterol levels,
vitamin C levels, vitamin E,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:90%
levels of inflammation.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the C reactive protein
is a very sensitive measure

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:90%
of inflammation.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a great choice.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The sed rate, which measures
how sticky red blood cells are.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
It's also a good
measure of inflammation.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got some
more exotic measures

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that measure oxidative stress.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So the urine lipid peroxide,
that's a great one.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi there.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:90%

also a certified clinical

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:90%
nutritionist.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a baseline test?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> A baseline is when you do
a blood test at the beginning

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to find out what your
initial values are.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I advocate that women should
get a baseline bone density

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:84%
test at about age
35 or 40, so as they

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
get older and do a follow
up bone density test,

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.920 align:middle line:84%
they'll have their
beginning baseline

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:84%
tests to compare it to find
out if they're getting worse

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:90%
or if they're staying the same.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just a starting point
is what the baseline is.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> How frequently should
I administer a blood test?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it enough to
just do a baseline

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and then do one at the end?

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The more you do,
the better it will be.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It depends a little bit on
your financial limitations.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I think a beginning, a mid study
and an end study might be good.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Jenny Slawta
and I'm an associate professor

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:90%
at Southern Oregon University.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> How is endurance measured?

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Endurance is measured
with a gas analyzer

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and you're looking at V02 max.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you hook
someone up to a gas analyzer.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
We also call it
a metabolic cart.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a mask on and they're
breathing from ambient air,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
so you know, just
basically from regular air.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they
exhale into what we

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:84%
call a mixing chamber, which
is part of the machine, the gas

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:90%
analyzer.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And that analyzes how
much oxygen was consumed.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if you use
a gas analyzer,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
you get someone all
hooked up to this

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you put them on a
treadmill or a bike or governor

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and you increase the work
load every three minutes,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the oxygen uptake
increase, increase, increase.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
At some point, if you're
able to reach them too there

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.018 align:middle line:84%
they're varimax which is
sometimes or quite often

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
difficult to do
you'll see a plateau,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
where they increase the workload
but the oxygen consumption just

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:90%
plateaus.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
identify max V02.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How will green smoothies
affect my athletes?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that by putting
athletes on the green smoothies

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.838 align:middle line:90%
that it depends.

00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It depends where
they're coming from.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:84%
What diet do they have
in the first place?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
An athlete coming in that
has less healthful diet

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to see
more improvement as opposed

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to one that might have
a really high quality

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:90%
diet of fruits and vegetables.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm interested to see
how the project goes.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I think that there will be--

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I know there'll be
substantial benefit

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to the ingestion of these green
smoothies on a regular basis.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It will be interesting
to see how much of that

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
we can document.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested to be
tracking this with you.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.123 align:middle line:84%
>> When you first brought
up this kind of pilot study

00:16:08.123 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of yours, I thought, you know,
that this is cool because I

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
love veggies, fresh fruit,
veggies, great stuff.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So for a smoothie, boy,
easy to digest and absorb.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great medium, a great
delivery medium for nutrients.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, with all
those nutrients in there,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants, you gotta see
some sort of a difference.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this is going
to be a lot of fun.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see
what's going to happen

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to all of these athletes
and how well they

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:90%
do with green smoothies.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:90%
See the refills.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Infinity.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard about an ultra runner
who drank green smoothies.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So I interviewed him to
get his input on why he

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.143 align:middle line:90%
found it necessary to do this.

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Timothy Olson.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.345 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mountain ultra
runner for the North Face.

00:16:57.345 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
an ultra runner

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is anything beyond the
marathon, 26.2 miles.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the last two
years I've just

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
had some really good wins and
a couple 100k championships

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:84%
in the Western states, a couple
other 50 ks and 50 miles.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But those are the
biggest ones and I'm

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
humbled to have done
so well in the sport.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> A traditional sports diet
instructs athletes to load up

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:90%
on carbohydrates.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.790 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about carb loading?

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have kind of went
against the grain in diet.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I found for
ultra running for me,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I like more grain free diets,
and not loading my body

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:90%
with lots of carbs.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
You know I have my green
smoothies I have fruit.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
So I'm getting carbs in there.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:90%
And I think people overdo it.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They think they need all
these carbs to replenish

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:90%
their glycogen storage.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
You get enough of that
throughout the day.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've just, with
my body in recovery,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
it's been beneficial
not to do all that.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Days before I officially
kicked off my study,

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I was faced with an unexpected
hurdle, fire, smoke,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and horrible air quality
plagued the Rogue Valley.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Mmmm.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's up, you guys?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It's August 8.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here
trying really hard not

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to freak out because all
of Oregon is on fire.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Air quality is
absolutely terrible.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of my athletes that
are supposed to be in my movie,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
being physically active,
they don't want to work out.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And I can't really blame them.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Basically I wake
up every morning

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I have dark circles
under my eyes.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
My lungs hurt.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel as though I'm smoking
six packs of cigarettes a day.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We took our baselines yesterday
when it wasn't so bad.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So all the preliminary
blood work is done.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
According to what
I was planning,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
we were supposed to start
drinking smoothies next Monday

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and just exercising,
tracking our benefits,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:90%
tracking how we feel.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like I might
have to postpone everything.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It's hard when things
get out of my control.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:90%
I do have one hope.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
There's some
thunderstorms supposed

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:90%
to roll in today and tomorrow.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we get a
really nice rain,

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:90%
it might just put out the fires.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It might sort of wash
the smoke and the dust

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and the ash particles
out of the air.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And we might be
back on schedule.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But until then, I'm just sitting
here with my fingers crossed.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER AND RAIN]

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You guys, thank you so
much for being here.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the baseline
endurance test.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing the
Cooper VO2 max field test.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite a VO2 max, but
it's the field equivalent.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't have
thousands of dollars

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.605 align:middle line:90%
to spare on a VO2 max machine.

00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
We're out here on
this beautiful track.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.168 align:middle line:90%
And basically, it's very simple.

00:20:42.168 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to run around
the track as many times

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
as we can in 12 minutes.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll tell you to stop.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do some
calculations and get a sense

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:90%
of how endurant you are.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Don't get worried.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to judge anybody.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Basically I just want
to see if anything

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
improves from the smoothies.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Because thus far, it's August.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.657 align:middle line:84%
You've probably been
running all summer.

00:21:06.657 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So this will be a
really good baseline

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
because you haven't been
drinking any smoothies.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We're only going to change
just that one factor hopefully.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll double your laps
in six weeks after we're done.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
I lined up for us

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
is an oxidative stress test.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.253 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come in the
mail hopefully this next week.

00:21:30.253 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a urine test
so you can do it

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.003 align:middle line:90%
in the privacy of your own home.

00:21:33.003 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to go anywhere.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't test for drugs
in case you're worried.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So, basically what
that's going to tell

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
us is free radical information.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Because according to Ross
Pelton, the natural pharmacist,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Houghton, people
who use their bodies a lot

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
have more free radical damage.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And we also want to see
if smoothies are going

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:90%
to affect that in any way.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.627 align:middle line:84%
So, after that's done, our
baselines will be done.

00:22:02.627 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you guys alone.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.252 align:middle line:84%
I'll connect with
you guys one on one

00:22:05.252 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and go to various events and
kind of film little segments

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I'll just
supply you with smoothies.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:90%
We're officially done.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:90%
You guys killed it.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And for now, as kind of a treat,
let's go have some smoothies.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.055 align:middle line:84%
This is a mango blueberry
banana with kale.

00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.224 align:middle line:90%
Doing the ladies first.

00:23:43.224 --> 00:23:45.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very green.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Jace, ladies first.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you guys so
much for being here.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Cheers.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> After the baseline
running test,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I established that all my
runners were in excellent

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:90%
The distance.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Each of them ran in '12
minutes is considered excellent

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:90%
for their age group.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I wondered how much
more they would improve,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
given that they were
already in such great shape.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
We're headed over
to CrossFit today

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to do the baseline endurance
challenge for the CrossFitters.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I have two types of
athletes in my documentary,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I have the runners and
I have the CrossFitters,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it'd
be fair to base

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
the endurance of CrossFitters
on a runners test.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do two
tests we did the field VO2 max

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
test for the runners,
which gave us

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
basically some information
of where they're

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
at in their endurance there.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And now we're headed
over to CrossFit Ashland

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing
with the CrossFitters.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
We're were CrossFit
Ashland here.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And we've chosen to
introduce you guys to Helen.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It's three rounds of a 400
meter run, 21 kettlebell swings,

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and 12 pullups.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be our baseline
workout for the green smoothie

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.898 align:middle line:90%
documentary.

00:25:02.898 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
We chose this because it
falls within about seven

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
to 12 minutes of
time duration, just

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
like the run did for the guys
and the gals for the runners.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.002 align:middle line:84%
And we're just hoping to
come out and crush it.

00:25:14.002 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> My CrossFitters were
also in good shape.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
According to the
CrossFit test Helen,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
they were within the
good to great range.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> After the first three
weeks of smoothie drinking,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
when I interviewed my
athletes individually,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I was disappointed to find
out that they weren't noticing

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot of difference.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The consensus was they thought
they felt a little better,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't sure it was
a result of the smoothies.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I was worried that my
study was turning out

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:90%
to be a waste of time.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Yet there was only
one thing I could do.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:90%
I had to finish the experiment.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Without telling my
athletes about my fears,

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I continued supplying
them with smoothies,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:84%
all the while secretly hoping
something would change.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
For those who may not know
that we might not mentioned it

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.940 align:middle line:84%
earlier, Jace hurt his
foot a couple of weeks ago,

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.867 align:middle line:90%
fell off a rock.

00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Sergei says that green
smoothies are pretty much good

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:90%
So, here we go and pour it on.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:90%
See if it heals me.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:14.321 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yeah.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And so not only is he
going to run 100 miles,

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
he's going to do so
as gimp, one footed.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to
talk him out of it.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to use
a razor scooter.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Segue.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Roller skate.

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:35.272 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.207 align:middle line:90%
>> What's up, man?

00:29:58.207 --> 00:30:00.692 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:30:00.692 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah the biggest thing that I
really noticed about this whole

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
experiment is that not only
are my recovery times a lot

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
quicker, but I can do my hard
workouts with more ease than

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I have this definitely a
sensation of just floatiness.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And pain doesn't kick in
like when it would normally

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:90%
kick in before.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.813 align:middle line:84%
My legs aren't getting
tired like they were before.

00:34:06.813 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
is the green smoothies.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's the only thing that
I have done differently.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've been running
since I was 11 years old.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
So it's been pretty
interesting things.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It's making me
pretty stoked on it.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
My brother is not
experiencing this.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Like he's seeing me
now pull away from him

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:90%
even more so than before.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell it's even
frustrating him a little bit.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's making his own
smoothies every other day or so

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:90%
now, just being like, huh.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it, man.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.123 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I don't get it either.

00:34:37.123 --> 00:34:39.082 align:middle line:84%
I told my little brother
when we were going out

00:34:39.082 --> 00:34:41.556 align:middle line:84%
for this 29 miler, I let him
know the one to two hours

00:34:41.556 --> 00:34:43.889 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the best
feeling probably because you're

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:90%
nice and warmed up.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You're not going so fast that
you're getting worn out yet.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But that when you hit
two hours, your legs

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.625 align:middle line:84%
are going to start
getting tired.

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:53.125 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you
hit three hours,

00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
you're probably really not
going to feel that good.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going to be
getting through the last hour.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.642 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where
you build your endurance.

00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:01.225 align:middle line:84%
Because you just
learn how to run when

00:35:01.225 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:90%
your legs feel like crap.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.252 align:middle line:84%
And we hit two hours,
I felt absolutely fine.

00:35:06.252 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And we just kept
moving through it.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I hit three hours
and I turned to him,

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and was, like, dude,
I'm not going to lie.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I feel fine right now.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's just like,
gave me the finger.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, just like,
this is not cool.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, the last hour I ended
up giving him the hydration

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:90%
pack and just took off.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Because I had plenty energy.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Got home, form was great
the whole way home.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I was like able to maintain.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then went through
the rest of the day

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and slept, woke up in the
morning and felt great.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And that has never
happened before

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to where I have that
kind of recovery time,

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
especially to where I
can do another work out

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:90%
two days later.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.702 align:middle line:84%
And like today, the
day after that workout,

00:35:42.702 --> 00:35:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I've already ran again today.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And I just, I feel fine.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, you ran four
days ago and been running every

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:90%
day since.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh yeah, every day and even
to, the big kicker was being

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:84%
able to do that almost
19 miles yesterday,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:90%
at like you know 6:45 pace.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's chilling.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That's not like pushing or
feeling pain anywhere, even

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:90%
getting heavy legs at all.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.083 align:middle line:84%
It just I mean, I could
have done another six.

00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, I'm not
going to push it right now.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Like whatever, I came
out to do the 30k.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And oh, well, that
it felt that easy.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.058 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
a placebo or what.

00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it is the smoothie.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really the only
thing that's different.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:90%
So, I don't know.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I've definitely noticed
some results as it were.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I think for me,
I'm probably kind

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of a bit of a different
case than a lot

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of the other athletes that
are getting tested on this.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.828 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been injured
throughout the whole thing.

00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't really been able
to train or go on 100 mile runs

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:84%
like some of these other guys,
or do what I traditionally

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:84%
like to do, which is you
know move big weights.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been kind of sidelined.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But even though I've been
sidelined, and not training,

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:90%
my weight has actually--

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I've dropped about
three or four pounds.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't gained
any weight at all

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:84%
without training, which for
me is kind of a big deal.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I can like
look at a loaf of bread

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and gain three pounds.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's exciting.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I notice that my
recovery time has decreased.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I did that
CrossFit up in Bend

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:90%
at the Summer Oregon Games.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:90%
And I also did it last year.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And last year when I did,
it I was out for at least

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.320 align:middle line:84%
a week after the competition
before I was back in the gym

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:90%
training again.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And this year after
the competition,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I took one day off and then I
was back in the gym training

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:90%
hard the next day.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:90%
So that was really exciting.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:90%
My appetite decreased.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I haven't needed to eat as
much quantity and as often,

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:84%
which, I just opened a
dance studio this week.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And it has been really good
because I don't have the time

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to eat, but I don't need it
because I have the nutrition

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:90%
from the green smoothies.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So since we've started
drinking it, you know,

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:90%
we're drinking a quart a day.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's just knocked
down my appetite.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's driving me to eat healthier
and less, which is really nice.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm down eight
pounds and obviously

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.960 align:middle line:90%
that's lower food consumption.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's directly attributed
to the green smoothie

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.810 align:middle line:84%
being in the mix,
you know, and getting

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.237 align:middle line:84%
all those healthy greens
and fruit and everything.

00:38:28.237 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:84%
In the last three
months, knowing this

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:84%
was happening, I
didn't change anything

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in my dietary intake,
my exercise scheduling,

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.362 align:middle line:84%
sleep patterns,
everything's the same,

00:38:40.362 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:84%
other than adding in
the green smoothies.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Overall though in
all my workouts,

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I feel like my cardio is intact.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm running
better, lifting faster.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to run now.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.812 align:middle line:90%
I've never been excited to run.

00:38:52.812 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Because now it doesn't affect
me you, know coming off a run,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.370 align:middle line:90%
then you have to lift weights.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.953 align:middle line:84%
You want to be prepared and be
able to control your breathing.

00:38:59.953 --> 00:39:02.575 align:middle line:84%
So you have to like rest until
you can control your breathing.

00:39:02.575 --> 00:39:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't seem
to be an issue anymore.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I can come right in through
the door, pick up the weight

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:90%
and start moving.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know whatever
external object I got to move.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So if that continues, I'm going
to be really, really pleased

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So this summer in July, I
ran a 50 mile race in the SOB.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And the race went pretty
well and the recovery

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
was pretty typical for me,
like soreness for a day or two

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.750 align:middle line:84%
after, pretty tired
for a week or so.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Definitely wanting to
take a break from running.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And then three weeks later I ran
the Waldo 100 k, 62 mile race,

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.980 align:middle line:84%
which was my first time
doing that distance.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the race was really
hard, but the recovery

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:90%
was pretty amazing to me.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like three
days after the race

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I was hardly sore at all.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I was not sore.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really
was not sore at all.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:90%
I felt great.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.920 align:middle line:84%
All the entire day
after the race,

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I just sipped on
green smoothies.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was key.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I may be sleeping better.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
that I've noticed

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.020 align:middle line:90%
from drinking the smoothies.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.690 align:middle line:84%
The jury's still out,
but the last two weeks

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I've had like good six
hour chunks of sleep, which

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:84%
is really unusual for me, so
kind of keeping my fingers

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:90%
crossed.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Since I've been drinking
green smoothies,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the main things I've noticed
is my energy throughout the day

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:90%
is elevated, it's maintained.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have as many
tips as it did before.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Another big notice is my mood.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm happier throughout
the day, less mood swings.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Not that I have any mood
swings, but, yeah just happier

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And feeling good, good energy.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed a lot less craving
for sugary and fatty foods.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:90%
That's my usual thing.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I've been running
a lot during the week

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Craig likes some Newman-Os
or some other processed,

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.570 align:middle line:84%
kind of junk food or
greasy, fatty foods.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Those cravings have
definitely reduced a lot.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've noticed that
my mental capacity is

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot better, and my
focus and concentration

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.290 align:middle line:90%
seem to be improved.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And my overall energy just seems
to be real even and my moods

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:90%
or even.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And coffee has just sort
of fallen away from me.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I drink an awful lot
of coffee every day.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I don't
like coffee anymore,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I just don't gravitate
towards it, which

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:90%
is kind of interesting to me.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Just because in a
day, I could drink

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.710 align:middle line:90%
six or seven cups of coffee.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And now I might have
one in the morning,

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a
desperate situation.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's replaced an awful lot
of food in my diet too.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't have much of an appetite
aside from the green smoothies.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I supplement my workouts
with protein, meat and stuff.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But the green smoothies are
just so thick and delicious,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just like I don't
really have a lot of appetite

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.380 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the day.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It fills me up, so it
just feels way healthier

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:90%
to be eating like that.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Since having added the
smoothies into my routine

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and diet, I definitely notice
the increase in energy level,

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:90%
especially with my running.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I drink them right before
I go in the mornings.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely feel more
energized and more ready

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and not as tired.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Like normally the first half
hour or so can be really tough.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Or depending on the long run, it
can be for hours really tough.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like once I
start like I'm ready to go.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just awake and
energized and ready to run.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think I noticed
anything different until

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:90%
probably about four weeks.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I just, when
doing runs and whatnot,

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:09.362 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like,
afterwards, I just felt

00:43:09.362 --> 00:43:10.570 align:middle line:90%
like I could just keep going.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It was like long
races, afterwards,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:19.272 align:middle line:84%
like the recovery just
felt much, much better.

00:43:19.272 --> 00:43:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can attribute
it to the smoothies or not.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was something a little
bit different than usual.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you change anything
else during this time?

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
something that

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.750 align:middle line:84%
surprised me is,
this time of year,

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I actually usually
go down in fitness.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's usually, have some
races at the end of the summer.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, kind of
just like taper off.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Go back to work.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And this year I felt like
my fitness didn't really

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:90%
go down much.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any really
different training

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:54.770 align:middle line:90%
or anything else.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So I guess another
thing that has changed

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is, I do crave sweets
less, which is nice.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a
huge sweet tooth.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's nice.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I just kind of
crave smoothies,

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
but I guess it's
much better for me.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The most obvious difference
that I've noticed in the way I

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
feel is that I don't have
like the same sort of lags

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.150 align:middle line:84%
in my energy level
throughout the day.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:84%
To the point where in the
first couple of weeks,

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:84%
it was almost odd where I
would drink it in the morning.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And then by 3:00
in the afternoon,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.165 align:middle line:84%
I still hadn't had any of
my usual cravings for lunch.

00:44:37.165 --> 00:44:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just try to
kind of usually

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:90%
listen to hunger and all that.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.747 align:middle line:90%
And so it felt strange to me.

00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, maybe I should-- maybe
I need to go eat right now.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I haven't eaten and
it's this late in the day.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:90%
But energy still felt great.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I still was eating, just
kind of later in the day.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of
just changing when

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I ate and then
also what I craved,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of
craving cleaner food.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.165 align:middle line:84%
Having added green
smoothies to my diet,

00:45:04.165 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I definitely noticed
that my recovery

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is a lot shorter especially
with cardio based workouts.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It might be two to three
hours, where in the past,

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:84%
it might have been two
to three days sometimes.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.440 align:middle line:84%
When that's been a real
positive for me, in the sense,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that I can get more workouts
in if I want to/ or I can feel

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.315 align:middle line:84%
fresher to move on
to whatever is next.

00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I've noticed
about the green smoothies

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.023 align:middle line:84%
is that my fingernails seem
to be growing a lot quicker,

00:45:28.023 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:84%
which I suppose means that I'm
getting more of the minerals

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.387 align:middle line:90%
that I need.

00:45:33.387 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't waste
any green smoothie.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:39.623 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.623 --> 00:45:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just saying
that for the camera.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really good.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:49.977 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.977 --> 00:45:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>> As the study came to an end
and all the blood work had been

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.440 align:middle line:84%
completed, it was time to check
in with the experts and get

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:84%
the data on how the smoothies
affected my athletes.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I was excited to find
out which of the markers

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.966 align:middle line:84%
we tested for showed the
biggest improvements.

00:46:03.966 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Hi, my name's Sergei.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Larry Shrewsbury.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much for--

00:46:08.373 --> 00:46:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a seat.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I took in the data.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.900 align:middle line:90%
First, we did a hypothesis test.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we followed that up
with a confidence interval.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So after I did
the report, then I

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
went through I
looked at which ones

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.730 align:middle line:90%
were statistically significant.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.097 align:middle line:84%
That's where we got a
call in the professionals,

00:46:26.097 --> 00:46:27.180 align:middle line:90%
the medical professionals.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They can look at these
confidence intervals

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
answer the question,

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:90%
is this narrowed down enough?

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If I am reading
this correctly,

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the sed rate was 2.5 higher
before and dropped that 2.5

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:90%
for the after.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So you had a decrease,
a net decrease of 2.5

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:90%
on the sed rate.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The higher the number,
the more inflammation,

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.680 align:middle line:90%
the worse off the person is.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a sed rate
somewhere around zero to five,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:90%
zero to 10, it's OK.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Zero to two, zero to
three is excellent.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where I really
like to see it.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So a decrease in that
sed rate of two and 1/2

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.550 align:middle line:90%
points, to me, that's important.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:84%
In one individual, it
doesn't jump out at me.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
population of a few people,

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.640 align:middle line:84%
10 people, something like
that, and the sed rate

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.930 align:middle line:84%
has on average dropped by
2.5, that's pretty meaningful.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.620 align:middle line:90%
You've made some changes.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So the nutrients
in those smoothies

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.350 align:middle line:90%
are having positive effects.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.290 align:middle line:84%
With inflammation, the more
research that gets done,

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
the more it turns out that it is
a critical piece for long term

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.910 align:middle line:90%
health or ill health.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:84%
High levels of inflammation
cause problems.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.690 align:middle line:84%
There will be a higher
incidence of cancer.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
inflamed in general,

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.150 align:middle line:84%
will have higher rates
say of colon cancer, lung

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:90%
cancer, et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:middle line:84%
They'll also have higher
rates of heart disease.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have more inflammation
in the arteries, the veins,

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:84%
you're going to put
more plaques in there.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to limit your
blood flow to your heart,

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.110 align:middle line:90%
to your feet, all over.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And you don't work so well.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Limit blood flow to the brain,
your thinker doesn't work well.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So the more inflammation,
the worse off

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:90%
you will be in the long term.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say one of the
trends, more or less,

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is that there were far more
athletes that had a decrease

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:84%
in their C reactive protein
inflammatory marker,

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:35.830 align:middle line:90%
which is a really good sign.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Here, Jace went from
17.17 down to 1.15.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge drop
in inflammation.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Kymmi went down in
CRP from 2.86 to 1.35,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.990 align:middle line:90%
fairly significant drop.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Here is Sean Roberts.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:84%
His CRP went down
from 0.48 to 0.25.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:84%
If you get your
inflammation marker down,

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.130 align:middle line:90%
that's really, really good.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Emille, his CRP went
down from 2.9 to 1.68.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Eric went down from 1.33 to
0.67, which is a great drop.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.250 align:middle line:90%
That's very significant.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.490 align:middle line:90%
So there is a trend in CRP.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Laura went down in CRP.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Joanne went down.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Aaron that went down in CRP.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Ben went up.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:90%
[RECORD SCRATCH SOUND]

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> At the tail
end of my project,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I found out that Ben was the
least consistent in drinking

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:90%
his smoothies.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is the reason his
CRP went up instead of down.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Overall--

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So pretty much
one person went up.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.950 align:middle line:90%
The rest went down.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so that is a trend that
I saw in the Lab Core printouts

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.890 align:middle line:84%
All of the athletes
except one had a decrease

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.940 align:middle line:84%
in their C reactive protein
between the pre and post-test.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's a key
inflammatory marker

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation is at the
core of all health problems,

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:57.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it's arthritis,
obesity, cancer,

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's disease, diabetes.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is involved in
all those health conditions.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you can reduce
your inflammatory load

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:84%
you're definitely improving
your health over time.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me
like with all but one

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.450 align:middle line:84%
of the athletes having a decline
in their C reactive protein,

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:17.140 align:middle line:84%
we could say that
there was a benefit

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of the green smoothies
in reducing inflammation

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.170 align:middle line:90%
in the athletes.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a key
take home from this study.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm firmly convinced that
drinking green smoothies

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.630 align:middle line:90%
is really a good thing to do.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no downside
to it whatsoever.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I think you might
be able to use what

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.600 align:middle line:84%
you've got here to possibly
get some funding for a larger

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.600 align:middle line:90%
study.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would certainly
support and be

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.440 align:middle line:84%
happy to be involved
in a larger study.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that a larger
sample size can only

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.220 align:middle line:90%
give us more information.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The endurance testing
also revealed improvements.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Nearly all of the runners
were able to run further

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:84%
during their second test
after the smoothie experiment.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Though it may not
seem very significant,

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that extra quarter
lap or half lap

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that they gained after
drinking smoothies could

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.810 align:middle line:84%
be the difference between
winning or losing the race.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The CrossFitters showed
even more improvement

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.500 align:middle line:90%
than the runners.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.420 align:middle line:84%
After drinking
smoothie for six weeks,

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.360 align:middle line:84%
their second endurance times
were nearly a minute faster

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.630 align:middle line:90%
than their first.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:90%
What drives people to exercise?

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.570 align:middle line:84%
What pushes a person
to run 100 miles?

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Why do people religiously attend
CrossFit classes to suffer

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:90%
through grueling workouts?

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it the endorphins?

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it the triumph
of mind over matter?

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Going into this project,
I knew very little

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.060 align:middle line:84%
about the lives of
extreme athletes.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take long to discover
that even from the sidelines,

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.420 align:middle line:84%
being part of a long
footrace is infectious.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Seeing runners stumble
into an aid station

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.750 align:middle line:84%
after running 80 miles, exuding
pure bliss and positivity,

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.350 align:middle line:84%
inspires a subtle jealousy,
a sort of curiosity

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:00.650 align:middle line:84%
to understand what these runners
feel after so many miles.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but wonder,
what the hell are they

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.460 align:middle line:90%
experiencing out there?

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And am I missing out?

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Living so closely with
extreme individuals

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.640 align:middle line:84%
for an entire summer
also helped me

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to understand why we need
ultra runners, CrossFitters,

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and other fitness freaks.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We need extreme athletes because
they push a stagnant society

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:84%
By challenging what
is physically possible

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:84%
extreme athletes inspire others
to rethink their own potential.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Working on this movie inspired
me to run a marathon myself.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Though I was always apprehensive
about running marathons

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in the past because it
seemed unhealthy and radical,

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:84%
after spending so much
time filming my athletes,

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't help but
run a trail marathon.

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.160 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of this
film, I set out to research

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.580 align:middle line:84%
whether green smoothies could
positively affect endurance.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The results of this
study have shown

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.387 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, green smoothies
do in fact improve endurance.

00:52:53.387 --> 00:52:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, we've
learned that green smoothies

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.260 align:middle line:84%
reduce inflammation and
thereby speed up recovery,

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.040 align:middle line:84%
reduce chances of injury,
and boost energy levels.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we can conclude
that green smoothies are

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.080 align:middle line:84%
an effective method for boosting
performance and improving

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:90%
the overall health of athletes.

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Though the effects of green
smoothies on endurance

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.260 align:middle line:84%
needs further study,
I believe we've

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.150 align:middle line:84%
had a small glimpse
of what will someday

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:18.202 align:middle line:90%
be a historic discovery.

00:53:18.202 --> 00:53:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I'm going to
keep drinking my smoothies

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and pushing my own limits
of what is possible.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Friday, I make the
last batch of smoothies,

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.460 align:middle line:84%
which means that
it's been six weeks.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to be sad
that smoothies are done?

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:57.261 --> 00:53:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I may have some
sort of withdrawals.

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just being like
a cripple or something,

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:90%
or just not having any energy.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.230 align:middle line:84%
May just end up being like a
moody old man or something.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Trying to figure out how
to keep you serving them up

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:13.340 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's funny.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.532 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says that.

00:54:15.532 --> 00:54:17.450 align:middle line:90%
There's gotta be a way.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.440 align:middle line:90%
For money.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Green for green, right?

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> After the project, I'm
definitely figuring out a way

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to keep this going.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it's crucial at
this point because it's

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.680 align:middle line:90%
been so beneficial.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm definitely continuing
drinking the smoothies.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.467 align:middle line:84%
I actually look forward to
drinking smoothies every day.

00:54:37.467 --> 00:54:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Having to figure out now, OK,
how am I going to budget this

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in when this whole
documentary is over.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Because, I don't
want to stop now.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's day eight on
no green smoothies.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll say that, the change in
effects on the green smoothie

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.200 align:middle line:90%
is subtle.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But going off of
them is not subtle.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.962 align:middle line:90%
Immediate inflammation.

00:55:03.962 --> 00:55:06.212 align:middle line:84%
I would just describe it
like, I was describing to you

00:55:06.212 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:84%
earlier how I felt like
my body was falling apart.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.610 align:middle line:90%
My elbow is tore up.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:18.560 align:middle line:84%
My lower back, my left
shoulder, it's unbelievable.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the effects of not
having the green smoothie.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing
everything I can to get

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:28.180 align:middle line:90%
prepared to get back on them.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And just make it
a daily routine.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You truly are a green
smoothie hustler.

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Psst, hey, this is the secret
part at the end of the movie.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> This is how I drink smoothie.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:56:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:11.030 align:middle line:90%
More juice goes down.
