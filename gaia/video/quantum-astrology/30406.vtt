00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:84%
RICK LEVINE: A troubled
youth went into confession

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and began by telling the
priest, before we get started,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I should tell you, I
don't believe in God.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The priest responded,
oh, it's OK,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
God either, which,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:90%
of course, upset the kid.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was not what
he expected to hear.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So he said, what do you mean
you don't believe in God?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the priest responded,
I don't believe in the god

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:90%
that you don't believe in.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:84%
By the same token,
I'm often confronted

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
with people who say they
don't believe in astrology.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And my response
is, I don't either.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Because chances are if you
don't believe in astrology then

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in the astrology
that you don't believe in.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.105 align:middle line:90%
What is astrology?

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
words astro logos.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Logos, as in the beginning of
the Bible, "In the beginning,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
there was logos," which was
poorly translated into "Word."

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Logos is not just
speaking of a word.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Logos is the synthesis
of idea end word.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it's the
logic of the universe.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And astro logos is the synthesis
of metaphysics and physics.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.325 align:middle line:84%
It's how the meta
physical becomes physical.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Astrology, simply stated,
is a study in correlation

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that planetary patterns have
causal relationships to events

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:90%
here on earth.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
As the ancients said,
"As above, so is below.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The within is like the
without of things."

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Astrology claims that
we as living organisms

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth are
affected by and part

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:90%
of a larger cosmic fabric.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
We can see that in the
framework of our lives

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:90%
if we look at it accordingly.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, we move through
the seasons astro logically.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
The earth moves around the
sun according to a logos,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
according to a
logic of astrology.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it has been said, that
astronomi, nomi naming, astro

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
naming, is about
naming of things

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
up there, the giving of the
names and definitions of stars

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:90%
and various celestial objects.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Astrology, however, is about
the meaning that is attached

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to those very same objects.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that
astronomy is a glove

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and astrology is the living
hand inside the glove.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
RICK LEVINE: From a
scientific point of view,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
it's all happening
pretty darn fast.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Just a few generations
ago, we lived in a world

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
where things were things,
what you saw is what you got.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Newton's world consisted of
gravity that made objects

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
collide, pulled flying
objects toward each other.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the law of how things
moved in the real world.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
But as we developed technology
to expand our perceptions,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
we began to develop tools that
allowed us to see infra, lower

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
than, and ultra, higher
than, frequencies that we

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:90%
could previously perceive.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It was Buckminster
Fuller who said

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that 99% of all science
in the 20th century

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
was happening in areas
of universe that were

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
invisible to our five senses.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Does that make it less real?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Telescopes gave way
to radio telescopes

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
as our sensory perceptions
were moved into other bands

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic frequency.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Microscopes gave way to electron
scanning microscopes that

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to see objects
or things that were so

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
tiny that if we looked
at them with optics,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
the size of a photon
would hit them

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and bounce off it
and, therefore, change

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:90%
the course of its action.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
In a way, our journey into
the subatomic realm that

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
began in the late 19th
century changed everything,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because scientists discovered
that these subatomic particles

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:90%
were not particles.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They looked like particles
when they were measured,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
but they travelled, they
propagated, like waves.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And so scientists came up with
a bizarre series of theories

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that we lumped together
and call quantum

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
theory or quantum
mechanics, that include

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:90%
theories of indeterminacy.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The more we know about where
an electron is the less

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:90%
we know about where it's going.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The more we know about
something's mass the less

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
we know about its trajectory.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
We can't know both.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We can know electron
as particle or as wave.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
The more we know about
it as particle the less

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
we know about it as wave.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics, according
to its inventor, Niels Bohr,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is not stranger than we think.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It's stranger than we can think.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Quantum theory has changed
everything, because what was

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
a mechanical, external
universe, has now

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:90%
become a web of intelligence.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
In this environment,
astrology makes sense.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
In this environment of
communication of information

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that is not just
about seeing things,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
astrology, again, fits

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:90%
into the scientific paradigm.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You see, our sense
organs perceive

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:90%
everything as vibration.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
If we hear something,
we're hearing frequencies.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
When we hear a note
like A below middle C,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
we're hearing 440
cycles per second.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
An octave higher, is
twice that frequency,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:90%
or 880 cycles per second.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
When we see something like the
color red, or the color green,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing a
particular frequency

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
the visible spectrum

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is a very narrow
slit in a very large,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
perhaps infinitely large
band, of frequency vibration.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
What we see as visible
light, Newton showed came

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:90%
from invisible white light.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And through a prism, we
saw that in visible light

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:84%
become red, orange, yellow,
blue, green, indigo, violet.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
However, we've now
learned that higher

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:84%
frequency than
violet, ultraviolet,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:90%
can be seen by some animals.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Bees, for example, with their
eyes, can see ultraviolet.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Snakes, with their eyes
and some other reptiles,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
can see infra to
red, or infrared.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:90%
They see heat.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:90%
We feel infrared is heat.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, lower
frequency than infrared

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
takes us through a band of
waves that include radio wave,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
short waves, that include
power wave distribution, 60

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
cycles per second that come
through our power outlets

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
in this country, or 50
cycles a second in Europe.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency than
violet, ultraviolet,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
includes waves that are so fast
that go up to gamma radiation,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that are so high frequency that
they pass right through earth

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
without even noticing that
there's something solid there.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It's my contention
that planet waves

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:84%
are not separate from the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Science has become real
good at instrumenting

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
radiation, but only

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:84%
in high enough
frequencies where they

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
can get repetitive signals.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
You see the problem with
instrumenting perception

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of a Saturn wave, is
that instead of happening

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
in gigahertz, or
megahertz, or kilohertz,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
it's happening only
three cycles per century.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get a
device that will tell us,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that can hear a Saturn
wave if we only get one

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:90%
beat every 29 and 1/2 years.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It becomes an interesting
dilemma from a scientific point

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you look at
planets we see up there,

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:90%
we see objects in space.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We see blocks of
rock, mass, lumps.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But our planet's particles,
or our planet's waves,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is light a particle
or is light a wave?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
At the microcosm,
quantum physics

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
has us believing that
microscopic subatomic

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
particles, are both at
once particles and waves.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the particle-wave duality.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
At the macroscopic level,
planets, in their own

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
the macro quantum universe,
are both particles and wave.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
We look up there and we
see Saturn in the night sky

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
or we see the moon
in the night sky.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
the moon is also a wave.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a wave of 13 beats
or 13 cycles per year.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And that 13 cycles
per year is not

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
any different than a cycle of
100s or hundreds of thousands

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:90%
of cycles per second.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The differences is that we can't
hear it and we can't see it.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We can only watch
it unfold in time.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:90%
And now we come full circle.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Because astrology is the
study of these waves.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the study of planet
waves introducing,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
not just a three-dimensional
reality of the real world

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
as we see it, but it
introduces a fourth dimension.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And that fourth
dimension is time.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Einstein's
famous equation,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
e equals m c squared, shows
clearly that mass and light are

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
tied up as one, that
mass becomes light,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:84%
becomes mass, becomes
light, in an endless dance.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is through
time, but time is tied up

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to the speed of
light, because as we

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
approach the speed of light,
time becomes infinitely slow.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Time stops at the
speed of light.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And so here there becomes
this kind of paradox of time

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and space all being mixed in.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And we look at astrology as
a way of understanding how

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
what we perceive in
this moment, as now,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually just one
piece of an ongoing,

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:90%
unfolding of planetary cycles.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
use the mapping

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
techniques of
astrology, which we

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
astrologers call a horoscope.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like a telescope allows
us to scope, to see, tele,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
far away, a microscope
allows us to scope,

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:90%
to see, something micro, tiny.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
A horoscope allows
us to see the hour.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
The word horo is
just Greek for hour.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So that astrologers
have a technology that

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
allow us to unfold the
understanding of this moment

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
with respect to a larger
perception of time,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
whether we do it
in an individual's

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
life, an individual who is
born, gets sick, gets healthy,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
becomes of age, has a
girlfriend or a boyfriend,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
suffers loss of love, suffers
the death of a parent,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
has a great job, has
their own family,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
becomes married, has
a family, grows older,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and all these events seem
to correlate in our lives

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to this same invisible
hands on these cosmic clocks

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
that we astrologers observe
by watching the planets go

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:90%
around and around and around.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
As an astrologer, I
am a pattern seeker.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I look for correlations
between larger

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
rhythms and smaller patterns.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I look for correlations between
events up there and events down

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And I find them.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, many
astrologers throughout the ages

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
have found these
very same patterns.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Astrologers have been employed
by kings and queens and popes

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and religions throughout
all humanity in order

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense of
what's going on,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
even Christianity, which says in
the Lord's Prayer, "It is done

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
on earth as it is in heaven,"
is simply reflecting that fact

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
connection between events

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:90%
down here and events up there.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
When I look at the planets, I
don't see planets with names,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I see a rich
mythology of symbol.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I see symbols that
have meaning that have

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
been attached to them by
humans in many cultures

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the symbols take
on similar meanings in cultures

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that are very far
apart, that had

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
no apparent communication
with each other from times

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
distant past.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Sanskrit,
the ancient Vedic astrologers

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
called Jupiter,
Guru, the teacher.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:84%
In the west, the Roman or
Latin word is Jupiter or Jove,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:90%
for the Greek word, Zeus.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
All of these images,
however, carry with them

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
a picture of a
beneficence, of greatness,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of largesse, of teaching,
of ideas, of opinions.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
The symbolism is consistent
throughout time and

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:90%
throughout different cultures.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Every planet has a mythology
and symbolism attached to it.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, Mars
is the god of war.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We astrologers look to the
planet Mars and its rhythms

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand how we may
defend our territory,

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
or how we egress, or how our ego
takes on individual situations.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We watch Mars heat up,
as the planet heats

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:90%
up in various phases of war.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:84%
We look at the rhythms of
planets relating to each other,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
the sun, the moon, Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
To an astrologer, these are
hands on a cosmic clock.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
We look at the clock on
the wall and when the two

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
hands are in the same place
we know that's the beginning

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:90%
of an hour.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
When two planets are
in the same place

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that's the beginning
of their cycle.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, when the sun
and the moon are lined up,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:90%
this is a new moon.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And it happens once a
moonth, or once a month,

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.325 align:middle line:84%
because our calendar
is astro logical.

00:17:29.325 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Every planetary pair has
a rhythm of new moon,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
like the beginning of an hour
on the clock, or full moon,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:90%
like half past the hour.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
This rhythm is repeated
on a monthly basis

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
by the solunar angle or
by the solunar rhythm.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
The sun and the moon
create a measurement

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in time that is the month.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But we on earth
look at patterns.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And we divide them in
half and in half again.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:90%
This is how we measure things.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So we divide a month in
half and we get a fortnight.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Although that's not
a measurement in use

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
much now, at one time
it was as important

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:90%
a measurement as a month.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
We divide a fortnight in
half and we get a week.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
So our calendar is astrological.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
When people say, do you
believe in astrology?

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I tell them, I don't
believe in astrology

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
anymore than I would believe
in chemistry or mathematics.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
It's something to know about.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool to use when it
can be applied sensibly.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Every planetary pair, like
the two hands on a clock,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:84%
like the hour hand
and the minute hand,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
have a cycle all repetition
where they come together,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
like a new moon, and when
they oppose, like half past

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%
the hour, like a full moon.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We can look at
these slower rhythms

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and we can see the relationship
between these planetary cycles

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and history.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Astrology doesn't only
affect individual humans

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't only affect
how I live my life.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't only influence my
rise and fall as a human being.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't only affect
the times in my life

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
when things seem to work easier,
as opposed to times in my life

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
when things seem to
just be more difficult.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We go through
phases in our life.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And these phases
seem to correlate

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
with these movements of the sun,
moon, and the various planets.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But so does the rise and
fall of civilizations.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations, just
like individual humans,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
seem to be born in a time, live
out a life, have a pattern,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
have different characteristics,
and go through their process

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:90%
of old age and decay.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can follow
these rhythms just

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
like we follow the patterns in
an individual person's life.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We can take, for example,
a planetary pair.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's start off with Saturn.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is an interesting
planet to begin with.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the
farthest planet

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:90%
from the sun to the ancients.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Now they didn't know that it was
the farthest planet to the Sun,

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
what they knew about Saturn
was that it had the slowest

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
movement of all the planets.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Of all the things that moved
around in the sky at night,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's movement
was the slowest.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Out past Saturn,
slower than Saturn,

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing but stillness.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The stars themselves
did not appear to move.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word "planet" is
just a Greek word for, star

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.665 align:middle line:90%
that moves, or wandering star.

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Saturn to the ancients
was the end of the road.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It was as far as
movement could take us.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is Latin for
Cronus, which is Greek.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Cronus, chronometer,
chronic, time.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is father time.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:10%
Saturn is, what you get,
is what you deserve.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Saturn is karma.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Karma is Newton's third
law, to every action there's

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:90%
an opposite and equal reaction.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It's very simply a planet
of cause and effect,

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's long term
cause and effect.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that as we
live our life, as we

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
get toward the end
of the life, Saturn

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
becomes the judgment of whether
our life was worthy or not.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
when the Christians

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
got a hold of the word Saturn,
it etymologically became Satan.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And Satan is Saturn but
with a negative spin.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're born
of original sin then

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
we also, when we die,
we find that we've

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
made the deal with the
devil with Satan or Saturn,

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a pretty picture.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, however,
Saturn does not

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:90%
carry this negative judgment.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:90%
But it does carry a judgment.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And when Saturn
moving through the sky

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
aligns with a planet in our
own individual birth chart,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
where a planet was on the
day, time that we were born,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
when Saturn aligns with the
planet on my chart, I feel it.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I go through changes,
so does everyone.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've been seeing
clients for close to 30 years

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and have tens of thousands
of cases of people whose

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
individual lives have responded
to the movement of the planets,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn is perhaps
the most obvious.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Things have changed.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And we now have moved
from an age of things,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
an age of
three-dimensional reality,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:84%
into a different realm,
into a realm of imagination.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And in a little bit we'll talk
about why that has happened

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and the astrological
ramifications

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:90%
of this great change.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to come
back to Saturn.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Because Saturn is about things.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is about real world.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about what you
see is what you get.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's about gravity.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about those things
which restrain us and hold

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
us back and give
us the structure

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:90%
within which to work and live.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the structures that
we work in and live in

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
is the structure of
the nation state,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
or religious structures, the
structures of laws of the land.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at Saturn as one

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of these hands on the clock,
Saturn goes around once

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:90%
every 29, let's say 30 years.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a rounded number, but
it's really 29 and 1/2 years.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We can take Saturn
and map it's 30

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
year cycle against a
cycle of another planet,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:90%
let's say Pluto.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is the slowest moving
planet that we know of today.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is the planet
that takes the longest

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to make one complete journey
or revolution around the Sun.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It takes Pluto nearly
250 years to make

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:90%
one journey around the sun.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
In that same time,
Saturn has made

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a little over nine
journeys, because it takes

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Saturn closer to 30 years.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that in
one Pluto trip around the sun,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Saturn will line up
with Pluto nine times,

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
approximately every 33 years.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Because Saturn goes
around once in 30 years

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
so then it catches up to Pluto,
Saturn goes around in 30 years

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and it catches up
to Pluto again.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:10%
And so we have this Pluto Saturn
cycle, just like the high noon

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:10%
position of the two hands
on our clock straight up,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:10%
we have Saturn and
Pluto aligning in their,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:10%
like their new moon position.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:10%
We have Saturn and Pluto
aligning once every 33 years.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:10%
We can look at
this cycle, and we

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:10%
can look at the
cycle with respect

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:10%
to the Saturn Pluto alignment
every 33 years, and then

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:10%
their opposition, that's
the half past the hour,

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:10%
the halfway point in
the cycle, just as a way

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:10%
of looking at a cycle.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:10%
A cycle is a circle.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:10%
A cycle is like the
cycle of a tide.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:10%
High tide.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Low tide.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:10%
12:00, 12:30, 1:00, 1:30.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.620 align:middle line:10%
High tide.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Low tide.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:10%
New moon.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:10%
Full moon.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Saturn Pluto conjunction.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.083 align:middle line:90%
Saturn Pluto opposition.

00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:10%
If we look back throughout
history at the Saturn Pluto

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:10%
cycle and mark down the years
in which Saturn Pluto are

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:10%
in their high noon position,
or they're half past the hour

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:10%
position, in other words,
when they're aligned

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:10%
either on the same side of
earth or on opposite sides

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, we
can see the fabric

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:10%
of the unfolding of the
clashes that go on and on

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:10%
and on through civilization.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no limit to
how deeply we could dig

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:90%
into this particular rhythm.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk
about Rome for a moment.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Because Rome, the imperial city,
did not have a foreign invasion

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:90%
for 1,100 years.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:84%
In 410 AD, Visigoths
came and sacked,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
burned Rome within a
period of about a week.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:84%
For 1,100 years no foreigner
had set foot into the city,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and in a week it was all over.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
That was within one year of
a Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
If we look back to 379, that was
the previous alignment and that

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:84%
was the year the Visigoths
actually arose, put themselves

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
on the map, to, at the time of
the following new moon cycle,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
next alignment, that

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:90%
was when they took over Rome.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We see this kind of repetition
of historical patterns

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
repeating themselves
over and over again.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:84%
When we learned
history in school,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
we learned history
using a timeline.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We put the dates of all the
historical events onto a line.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:90%
And we labeled them.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at the
unfolding of history

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:90%
bringing it right up to now.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But as an astrologer, we look
at the hands of the clocks

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
going around and
around and around.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:10%
We look at the
planets moving around

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:10%
in their repetitive cycles,
and we see time not as a line,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:10%
but as a continual interplay of
waves, cycles, within cycles,

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:10%
within cycles.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at history
through the lens of astrology,

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:10%
through the lens of this
Saturn Pluto alignment, which

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:10%
happens every 16 years or so.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:10%
It's in effect for about
a year when they align

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:10%
on one side of the
Earth, or with Earth

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:10%
in the middle on both sides,
one on each side of the Earth.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:10%
We can look, for example,
at little events that

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:10%
don't make much sense
unless we look at them

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:10%
in a huge historical context.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Or we can look at large events
that by themselves stand out

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:84%
as a tremendous ripple
into the history

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:90%
of our culture or our planet.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, at a Saturn
Pluto alignment in the year

00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
532, Justinian, who was
trying to recreate Rome.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember Rome had fallen
to the Visigoths in 410 AD.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Now a century later,
Justinian trying

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:14.280 align:middle line:84%
to recreate the
dominion of Rome,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:90%
put down a tax revolution.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And in one afternoon
his imperial troops

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:84%
swept into in an arena
in Constantinople

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and killed 30,000
people in one afternoon.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Now we look at it at
a cataclysmic event

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:84%
like the bombing of the World
Trade tower, the September

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
11, 2001, when the United
States was attacked

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:84%
by a group of terrorists
using our own technology,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
using US technology, against
this country in a demonstration

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
that has somehow pulled
the rug of safety

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:84%
out from under many of
the people in our country.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create by using
the Saturn Pluto rhythm a wider

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
perspective on this event, that
shouldn't take anything away

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
from the importance
of this event,

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
but instead frame it as part
of an ongoing continual brush

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:90%
fire.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And you say, brush fire?

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, two buildings
were destroyed

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and several thousand people.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, this isn't a
comparative issue.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:10%
We're not saying that this was
more or less or better than

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:10%
or worse than, but
remember in 532 AD,

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:10%
30,000 people were killed in one
afternoon at this same cycle.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
events that feed

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:84%
into this clash, this clash
between nation states,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
between religious
points of view,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:84%
between metaphysical
perceptions of the universe.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
In 629, for example, under
a Saturn Pluto alignment,

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Mohammed walked into
mecca and without firing

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
a shot took over the city and
declared the state of Islam.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Islam was declared a nation
state, or a city-state

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
at a Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
A century later in 711,
Islam invaded Europe,

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:84%
actually the Moors came
over the Iberian Peninsula

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and took over Spain.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:10%
This was a major
historical event.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.800 align:middle line:10%
And they were there
for five centuries.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And it was in 1212, nearly
500 years later, in 1212,

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:10%
that within a one
year period of time,

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:10%
Catholic Spain, in
a series of battles,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:10%
kicked the Arabs out of
Spain and back into Africa.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough in 1212 there
was a Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a cellular
memory in history somehow

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that keeps these cycles
alive, even if it's

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:90%
over periods of centuries.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we look
at astrology often

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:84%
from the period
of a human being,

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and we can see the patterns
in an individual life.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.030 align:middle line:10%
We are removing ourselves
and looking at these patterns

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:10%
repeating throughout history.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just these events.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean we can look
at in the year 800,

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:10%
for example, Charlemagne, was
declared emperor by the pope.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And this ties to a
sequence of Saturn Pluto

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
alignments that also
tied to the year

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that Augustine arrived
in England to convert

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:90%
the Saxons to Christianity.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It also corresponds
to Charlemagne

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.160 align:middle line:90%
defeating the Saxons.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, we see
these repetitive issues

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
coming up over and over
again at each alignment

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Saturn Pluto.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:10%
There's not a major historical
event at every alignment

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:10%
of Saturn and Pluto.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it seems to lay
dormant for one or two cycles

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and then all of a sudden like
clockwork on the next cycle

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:10%
something will happen.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:10%
For example, other
major historical events

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:10%
that correspond within a year
of the Saturn Pluto alignment,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:10%
include the Norman
invasion of England, 1066,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:10%
which was the year
that determined

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:10%
England would be part
of Europe, rather

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:10%
than part of Scandinavia.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:10%
This was very important for
world history as we know it.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1098 there was a
Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And in 1099 Jerusalem was
reclaimed by the Christians

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:90%
after Arab control.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
This again, was very
important if we look at this

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
in an ongoing
history, especially

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
in light of the events
of September 11, 2001.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
We see this ongoing clash
between Christianity,

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Islam, Judaism, Hinduism.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
religious clashes

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:84%
they keep kind of coming up
again and again and again.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember we had
Islam founded in 629.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We had Islam conquering
Catholic Spain in 711.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We had Catholic Spain
reclaiming dominance in 1212.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:10%
We have, for example, in 1518,
within a year of Martin Luther

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:10%
announcing and posting
the 95 Theses, which began

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:10%
the Protestant Reformation.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:90%
This was a very big one.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:10%
We have in 1212 an alignment
of Saturn Pluto, which

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:10%
corresponded with the children's
crusade, in which 50,000

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:10%
children were
killed in an attempt

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:10%
to recapture the Holy Land
again for Christianity

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:10%
from Islam or from the Arabs.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:10%
In 1534, England separated
from the Catholic church,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:10%
In 1617, we had the beginning
of the 30 Years' War.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:10%
And 1648 was the end
of the 30 Years' War.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Both 1617 and 1648 were
Saturn Pluto alignments.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And what was that war about?

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a war between
Protestantism and Catholicism.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:10%
Again, we have the same event
that keeps coming back and back

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:10%
and back and back again.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.550 align:middle line:10%
We even look more
recently at the Saturn

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Pluto alignment in 1786.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Well it was 1787
that the American

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Constitution was drafted.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:10%
So we see the correspondence
in major political events

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:10%
like that, bringing the Saturn
Pluto alignment closer to home,

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:10%
closer to the 21st
century, where we now live.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.080 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at some
of the recent alignments.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Because there's a
very interesting theme

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:10%
or several themes that develop.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
1834, Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
1834 was a big year
on several counts.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it was the year
that England outlawed slavery

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
British Commonwealth,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:84%
1834 slavery abolished in
the British Commonwealth.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.170 align:middle line:84%
1834 though was also
a big year for Spain.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It was not a good
year for Spain.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And we see here a continual
theme of colonial domination

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and then the kicking off
of colonial domination.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.550 align:middle line:84%
1834 was the year that Simon
Bolivar defeated the Spaniards

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in what was then
called New Granada,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and is now Colombia, Ecuador,
Guatemala, et cetera.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
1834, Spain lost control
in South America.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.640 align:middle line:10%
1834, the end of slavery
in the British Empire.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:84%
At the next
alignment in 1850, we

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
have the beginning of the
slavery debate in the United

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:84%
States of America that
culminated at the next Saturn

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Pluto alignment in
1866, when the 13th

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Amendment was passed slavery
was outlawed in this country.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
ongoing theme now.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:24.410 align:middle line:10%
That again, takes
from 1834 to 1866,

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:10%
and there's three
Saturn Pluto alignments

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:10%
that define the definitive
points in this cycle

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:10%
of the ending of
slavery, not only

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:10%
of in England but in the
United States of America too.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:10%
In 1883, England was
involved in military action

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:10%
to create the Suez Canal,
to protect the Suez Canal.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So there was military action
between the west, England,

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Also interestingly,
within a year in 1834,

00:37:55.190 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
a group of Europeans met in
Europe to carve up Africa

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:90%
under European domination.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:84%
At the following
alignment in 1898,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:84%
again, another bad
year for Spain.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Because 1898 was the
Spanish American War

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:84%
in which the United
States booted Spain out

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Philippines
and out of Cuba.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, 1898 had
another interesting event.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And here we have an
important theme that comes up

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the most
obvious event that happens

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:90%
isn't always the most important.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And what also
happened in 1898, was

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:84%
it was the first meeting and
the creation of the World

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Zionist Organization.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
At the following alignment
of Saturn and Pluto in 1914,

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:84%
we have another very large
sequence of events, the biggest

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
being World War I, the
Great War, the war in which

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands
of people just were

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
marched into front lines
and met bullets and bombs

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:90%
and were fought.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And the lines barely
moved, hundreds

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of yards over the
course of years,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
there was just a
matter of death.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Also, during the
alignment of 1914,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:84%
we saw England sending
representatives

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to the Arab countries requesting
their support militaristic

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.460 align:middle line:84%
against the Ottoman
Empire and to fight

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:90%
on the side of England.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:84%
England's promise was that
if you fight on our side,

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.420 align:middle line:84%
we will guarantee you freedom
from the Turks, freedom

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:84%
from the Ottoman
Empire after the war.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact that's
why after the war,

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:84%
countries like Iraq,
Iran, Syria, were created,

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Lebanon, with countries
like England and France

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
protecting them from the Turks.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the Arabs looked
at that as colonial domination

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
also and England met
its match in Iraq.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They packed up and went
home as we know and so on.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But the point here is
that the World Zionist

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Organization was founded in 1898
under a Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:10%
Under 1914, England
tied itself into this

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:10%
by promising to defend
Arab sovereignty

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:10%
or the homeland rule by Arabs.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
At the following
alignment 1931, we

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
have the Zionists now
rising against England,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.390 align:middle line:84%
putting financial pressure
and pressure on England.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:84%
England declaring
war in Palestine,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:90%
remember it was Palestine then.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It was established
as an Arab state.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
England throws up
their hands and says,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.770 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what to do.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Also in 1931, we have
Hitler coming to power.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We have Mussolini
coming to power.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.150 align:middle line:90%
We have Stalin coming to power.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We have the Chinese
being invaded by Japan.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.210 align:middle line:84%
1931, was a huge alignment
of Saturn and Pluto.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And actually, even
though World War II

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fall on this
particular series,

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:84%
just because of its enormity,
I don't want to leave it out,

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
because it falls on
the halfway mark.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:10%
World War II falls on a Saturn
Pluto square, a 90 degree

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:12.680 align:middle line:10%
angle, and that kind of comes to
being also tied to this cycle.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I should also mention
that in 1931, India

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:90%
was rebelling against England.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
That was the year that Gandhi
led a march to the sea in which

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:84%
the Indians took sea water,
boiled it to make salt

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:84%
as a demonstration
of their freedom

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
because England was
requiring Indians

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.670 align:middle line:84%
to purchase both
fabric, woven textiles,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and salt from England.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It was a way of creating
economic dependence.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:10%
And Ghandi's famous Salt
March or the March to the Sea,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.670 align:middle line:10%
landed him in jail
that year, 1931.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, at the next
alignment of Saturn and Pluto,

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
we have England
granting independence

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.610 align:middle line:90%
to India and Pakistan.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We in the West think,
what a wonderful thing.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
There was no war fought.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi through
peaceful resistance

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:84%
led the Indians to
throw off the shackles

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.740 align:middle line:90%
of colonial domination.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:84%
However, in our history, we
sometimes gloss over the fact

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
or we just forget that half a
million Hindus and Muslims were

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
killed in battle skirmishes
after the independence was

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:84%
granted, after England
packed up and went home.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't all good news.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, in 1947, we
also have within a year

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:84%
on either side of it,
we have the United

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Nations being founded in 1946.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We have the United Nations
drafting a plan that says,

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.651 align:middle line:84%
let's take this area called
Palestine, give half of it

00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to the Jews.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Zionist
movement founded in 1898,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
under the same alignment.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:10%
Now we have the
United Nations saying,

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.140 align:middle line:10%
let's divide this up and
give half to the Jews

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:10%
and call it Israel,
give half to the Arabs

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and they can keep
calling it Palestine.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But by 1948,
Palestine disappeared.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Israel was on the map.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.190 align:middle line:10%
And again, it's tied to this
same ongoing battle of who

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.220 align:middle line:10%
is in control of Jerusalem.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We then jump to the
next conjunction,

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or the next alignment of
Saturn and Pluto, in 1965.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.680 align:middle line:84%
This is interesting because the
Mideast has heated up again.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We have rebellion
happening in Cyprus.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We have certainly the
Israel Arab crisis now

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is reached a fervor
point which culminated

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Seven Days War in 1967.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:10%
But we also have another
interesting development

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:10%
and that is the standoff
that became the Cold

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:10%
War at the previous
alignment in 1947

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.430 align:middle line:10%
at the end of World War II
between the United States

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.710 align:middle line:10%
and its allies and the
communist countries

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.580 align:middle line:10%
behind the Iron
Curtain, which went

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:04.590 align:middle line:10%
down right around the Saturn
Pluto alignment in 1947.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:10%
In 1965, we have the
free world, the world

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.000 align:middle line:10%
of capitalism, the world
of the United States

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:10%
and the United States'
allies, fighting

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.790 align:middle line:10%
the Soviet Union in an
area that's marked off

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:10%
called Vietnam.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if this
is the only safe way

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to have a war in a time
of nuclear weapons,

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:29.390 align:middle line:84%
so that we fight
this war in Vietnam,

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.480 align:middle line:84%
which was at its height during
the alignment in the mid '60s.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll come back to the
mid '60s in a few minutes.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the mid
'60s were even more

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
astrological important than
just this regular Saturn Pluto

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.620 align:middle line:90%
alignment.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:51.370 align:middle line:84%
The following alignment of
Saturn and Pluto is in 1982.

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:54.920 align:middle line:84%
1982 is an interesting
year because again, we

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.400 align:middle line:84%
have the Mideast
totally topsy turvy.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.140 align:middle line:84%
1982 saw Israel
invading Lebanon.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
1982 saw the Soviets tied
up in an unwinnable war

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:90%
in Afghanistan.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It was like their Vietnam.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:10%
1982 saw the only 20th century
war between a colonial power

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.310 align:middle line:10%
in the New World, and
that was the Falkland

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:10%
Island War, which
may not register

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.280 align:middle line:10%
big in our historical map.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But it was a war between
England and Argentina.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was a war where planes
flew, bombs were dropped,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.880 align:middle line:90%
people were killed.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But 1982 has another
interesting event.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said the
most obvious thing isn't

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:90%
always the most important?

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Remember Ghandi's
Salt March in 1931

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:90%
at the Saturn Pluto alignment?

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.630 align:middle line:10%
Remember India getting
its independence in 1947

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:10%
at the Saturn Pluto conjunction?

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Well in 1982, at the
Saturn Pluto conjunction,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.840 align:middle line:90%
the movie Gandhi is released.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't make it up this good.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
a thread that gives

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:90%
times for certain expression.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And these expressions
seem to carry

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
patterns on and on and on.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.760 align:middle line:84%
When we look at history
through the eyes

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary motion, through
these grand, divine hands

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:84%
on a cosmic clock,
we begin to see

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that the terrible events
of September 11, 2001,

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:90%
were not isolated.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They were, in fact, part of
an ongoing skirmish border

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.720 align:middle line:84%
wars between different
points of view

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that have continued since
the invasion of Rome,

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to the Crusades, to
the Battle of Hastings,

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to the invasion of
Spain by the Arabs,

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:90%
all the way up through now.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
same ongoing battle.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only way
that we'll get perspective

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.730 align:middle line:84%
on what happened in New
York and in Washington DC

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:17.320 align:middle line:84%
on September 11, 2001, is as
we look at this pattern unfold.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.270 align:middle line:10%
And the next Saturn Pluto
alignment is not until 2020.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it will take
until then for us

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see what this
does to set up what happens

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.330 align:middle line:84%
in 2020 and then in
subsequent alignments

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:90%
between Saturn and Pluto.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that we
can look at any two planets

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and look at their symbolism
and see different rhythms

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.600 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Pluto
are particularly

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:50.340 align:middle line:84%
interesting because
they align six times,

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.640 align:middle line:84%
or actually three
times a century,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:90%
and then the halfway alignment.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.920 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like-- it's
almost like a musical beat,

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:06.410 align:middle line:84%
like a Waltz, 1, 2,
3, 1, 2, 3, except.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:10.330 align:middle line:90%
It's 1, 2, 3 every 100 years.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:90%
1 and 2 and 3 and.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the Saturn
Pluto conjunction,

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:84%
opposition,
conjunction, opposition,

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:90%
conjunction, opposition.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes Waltz
time for civilization.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't dance to
it individually.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But we dance to it as
a collective humanity,

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:84%
as we play out these
wars and these skirmishes

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:90%
and these battles between ideas.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that we
can look at any two planets

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and look at their symbolism
and see different rhythms

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Take the planet
Uranus, for example.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Uranus takes 84 years to
go around the sun once.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Unlike Saturn, we
were talking about

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.580 align:middle line:90%
before, which takes 30 years.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is more personalized.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the over 30,
under 30 thing.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's when we reach
30 years of age,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
when Saturn makes one
complete turn around the sun,

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.090 align:middle line:90%
we grow up.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:90%
We become mature.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.290 align:middle line:90%
We become over the hill.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:90%
We become stuck.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
If we're over 30, we
look at people under 30,

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and even if they're
very wonderful people,

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.020 align:middle line:90%
they're still kids.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.120 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that happens around 30

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.810 align:middle line:90%
about becoming of age.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Now Uranus is an 84 year cycle.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough if someone

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.650 align:middle line:84%
lives to be in their
mid '80s we say

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.370 align:middle line:90%
they enter a second childhood.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we get that one complete
cycle of the planet Uranus.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is the weird plan.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.560 align:middle line:90%
It's north pole faces the sun.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:90%
The moons are in the equator.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.291 align:middle line:84%
Everything about
Uranus is weird.

00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's different.
It's eccentric.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Uranus astrologically
symbolizes lightning.

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It symbolizes the release
of built up energy.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It releases energy in a crash
that can be very erratic, very

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.710 align:middle line:84%
upsetting, very
revolutionary, but Uranus'

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:84%
job is to release
stored up energy

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:90%
so that it can become freed.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, Uranus
was discovered right

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.080 align:middle line:84%
around the time of
the French Revolution

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and the American Revolution, a
time of independence for man.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And often we astrologers look
at the more modern planets

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and we observe that the time
in which they were discovered

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.360 align:middle line:84%
seems to correlate a little
bit with their symbolism,

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.920 align:middle line:84%
like Pluto being discovered
at the time of the rise

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of mass fascism in the 1930s.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Neptune being discovered
around the time of the rise

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:32.800 align:middle line:90%
of the steam engine.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Neptune the planet of expansion.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a gaseous planet also.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's come back to the planet
Uranus, which takes 84 years

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.570 align:middle line:90%
to go around the sun once.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's compare its cycle to
Neptune, which takes 165 years

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to go around the sun once.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.810 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
when Uranus has made

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.430 align:middle line:84%
one complete journey,
84 years, Neptune

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:90%
is about halfway around.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So it takes two Uranus
cycles for Uranus

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:90%
to catch back up to Neptune.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:16.210 align:middle line:10%
So Uranus and Neptune align
like the hands on our clock

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:23.030 align:middle line:10%
at high noon, only
once every 172 years.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:10%
So this is a much rarer cycle
than the Saturn Pluto cycle

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.970 align:middle line:10%
that we were talking
about earlier, which

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.670 align:middle line:10%
occurs approximately
every 33 years

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.370 align:middle line:10%
in alignment in conjunction.

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:41.440 align:middle line:10%
Uranus Neptune occurs
once every 172 years.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.270 align:middle line:10%
It's occurred recently.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:50.760 align:middle line:10%
The last Uranus alignment
with Neptune was in 1993.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Now 1993, actually the period
of time of three or four

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.360 align:middle line:84%
years around there,
from the late '80s,

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.500 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
the early '90s,

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.190 align:middle line:84%
was a massive
realignment of power

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:90%
structures on planet Earth.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
Uranus Neptune

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:12.690 align:middle line:84%
seems to affect the cycle of
art, of science, of technology.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:10%
In 1993, the World Wide Web,
give or take a couple of years,

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:10%
took over the planet.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like in Marshall
McLuhan words, we flipped out.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Our internal nervous system
became an external web

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.460 align:middle line:84%
as if the brain now
existed out here

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and we were moving around
surfing, so to speak, inside

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of this larger
consciousness that had

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.600 align:middle line:90%
been created in the early '90s.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.650 align:middle line:10%
If we go back one complete
Uranus Neptune cycle,

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:49.530 align:middle line:10%
the last time that they
conjoined was in 1821.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:10%
Now the early 1800s were
a pretty powerful time.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.250 align:middle line:10%
From a scientific or
technological point of view,

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.760 align:middle line:10%
we had people like George
Omen, Michael Faraday, people

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.260 align:middle line:10%
discovering playing
with learning

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.000 align:middle line:10%
how to work with
electricity, theorizing

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.500 align:middle line:10%
what electricity was.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:84%
What's magnetism, making motors,
and making electrical circuits.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But the big question
of that time

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:84%
was how is electricity connected
to magnetism, if at all?

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the alignment of Uranus,
the planet of electricity,

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and Neptune, which most
astrologers will correspond

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:84%
because of its
ruling of the oceans

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Neptune the god of the oceans.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's that sense of the field.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the sense of the diffusive.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Electricity has current and
it moves around according

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to a particular frequency.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Magnetism, however,
is more field related.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Uranus astrologically
relates to electricity.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Neptune astrologically is
symbolized by magnetism.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1821, the year that Uranus,
the planet of electricity,

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.000 align:middle line:84%
conjoined Neptune, the planet
of magnetism, Hans Christian

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Oersted, in a lecture in
front of a group of students,

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.410 align:middle line:84%
took a bar magnet and ran
it over a closed circuit

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:18.510 align:middle line:84%
with a voltmeter on it and saw
that as he moved the magnet

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.850 align:middle line:90%
it created electrical current.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that electricity
and magnetism were, in fact,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.200 align:middle line:90%
part of one singular force.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And the coined word was,
from that period of time,

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.100 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetism.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetism Uranus
Neptune alignment.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And what about
the halfway point?

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:44.490 align:middle line:10%
The half hour, so to speak, when
Uranus and Neptune were opposed

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.720 align:middle line:10%
with earth right in the middle.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:10%
This was 1906.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And in 1905, within a
year of this alignment,

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.240 align:middle line:84%
we had Einstein writing and
delivering the three papers

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that shook modern
physics, pulled

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the rug out from under us,
destroyed the solid ground

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.980 align:middle line:84%
upon which Newton had built his
physics, because in the Newton

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:84%
the perception of the world,
everything was about things.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It was things of substance.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:22.090 align:middle line:84%
It was billiard balls having
action against each other.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Every action had an
opposite and equal reaction.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.810 align:middle line:84%
If we had enough
mathematics, we could

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:84%
plot the trajectory of anything
and know where it was going.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Everything was cause and effect.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Along comes Einstein, and
gives us a theory that

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:90%
intertwines time with space.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:84%
To Newton, time was an
independent variable,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:48.570 align:middle line:90%
space was where things happened.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, no,
space is simply

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:90%
gravitationally warped time.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Time is gravitationally
warped space.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.500 align:middle line:90%
The two of them are entwined.

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:06.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact what we see as matter
is light that has somehow

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.000 align:middle line:84%
trapped itself into
holding patterns,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.517 align:middle line:90%
tied itself up into knots.

00:56:11.517 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We as crystalline structures
are in fact, light energy that

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.560 align:middle line:84%
is tied gravitationally into
patterns that have holding

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
patterns, that, in fact,
respond to the larger

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:30.940 align:middle line:84%
gravitational or electromagnetic
pull of the planets.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.980 align:middle line:90%
This is why astrology works.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.256 align:middle line:84%
You see, planets are
electromagnetic vibrations.

00:56:37.256 --> 00:56:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:43.400 align:middle line:10%
So let's come back to this
Uranus Neptune cycle, which

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:50.460 align:middle line:10%
was aligned in 1821, opposite
in 1906, aligned again in 1993,

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.200 align:middle line:10%
and we can see how it relates
to technology on some level.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.850 align:middle line:10%
Look at one other cycle.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:57:01.010 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at
Uranus aligning with Pluto.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Uranus aligns with Pluto
approximately every 133 years.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Uranus, a planet of
lightning sudden change.

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is Latin for Hades,
which is Greek for Hell.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is the lord
of the underworld.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is everything
we don't understand.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the deepest powers
and desires and intensity.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:38.480 align:middle line:10%
The last time that Uranus
aligned with Pluto was in 1965.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.320 align:middle line:84%
If you remember earlier we
talked about 1965 as also

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.100 align:middle line:90%
being a Saturn Pluto alignment.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So 1965, 66, was not only
Saturn aligned with Pluto,

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:54.530 align:middle line:84%
but it was Saturn aligned
with Uranus and Pluto.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:57.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a major
alignment and anyone

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.560 align:middle line:84%
who lived through
the '60s can remember

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.780 align:middle line:90%
that it was a major alignment.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, consciousness
on the planet

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.110 align:middle line:84%
changed during that
period of time.

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough,
there are correlations

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that aren't always
the most obvious

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that are sometimes
the most important.

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:22.090 align:middle line:84%
In 1965, while Uranus
aligned with Pluto,

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a
technological leap taken.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.350 align:middle line:84%
IBM announced it's
System 36, which

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.160 align:middle line:84%
was the first
business computer that

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.140 align:middle line:90%
came complete with software.

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that IBM
believed that not very

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.670 align:middle line:84%
many of them would be
sold because it felt

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that the main purpose
of this computer

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.060 align:middle line:84%
was for publishing the
book of capitalism,

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.420 align:middle line:84%
publishing digitally
the information that was

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.200 align:middle line:90%
needed to sustain a business.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.470 align:middle line:10%
However, when we have
outer planet conjunctions,

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:57.390 align:middle line:10%
outer planet alignments,
that take place

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.170 align:middle line:10%
very near each
other, in time, they

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.510 align:middle line:10%
create a fabric of
their own, which

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.790 align:middle line:10%
is what has happened because
Uranus aligned with Pluto

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:09.210 align:middle line:10%
in the mid '60s and then
Uranus aligned with Neptune

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:13.120 align:middle line:10%
in the early '90s and that's
within a short enough period

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.150 align:middle line:10%
of time that we can
remember, those of us

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:19.740 align:middle line:10%
who lived through both of these,
we remember the similarity

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:23.040 align:middle line:10%
of what happened as these
outer planets aligned

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.460 align:middle line:10%
and we had amazing awareness.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:30.170 align:middle line:84%
We left our normal way
of thinking of things

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and we learned things from
a spiritual dimension,

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:36.270 align:middle line:84%
from a dimension of imagination,
from a dimension of technology

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:39.160 align:middle line:84%
change, from a dimension
of music change,

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.990 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's look back
in history at a time

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:52.400 align:middle line:84%
recently when Uranus
Pluto conjunction

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:58.920 align:middle line:84%
was followed in a near immediate
Uranus Neptune conjunction.

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The most recent example of
a Uranus Pluto conjunction

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:05.830 align:middle line:84%
followed by Uranus
Neptune conjunction

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
was the Uranus Pluto
conjunction of 1455,

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.490 align:middle line:84%
followed by the Uranus
Neptune conjunction a 1479.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Now anyone who is a history
student or an art history

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
student will recognize
that period of time

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
as the height of
the Renaissance,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.170 align:middle line:84%
the Florentine period
of artistic flourishing.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough
though, again, there's

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
always something that isn't
the most obvious event

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.480 align:middle line:90%
that becomes quite important.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
In 1455, the year that
Uranus aligned with Pluto,

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.650 align:middle line:10%
a German fellow
named Gutenberg mass

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:49.210 align:middle line:10%
produced a Bible on a
machine that he invented,

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.680 align:middle line:10%
the printing press,
which he felt

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.530 align:middle line:10%
would only have one purpose and
that was to print the Bible.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.310 align:middle line:10%
After all, what other
book could be worth

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.740 align:middle line:10%
printing multiple copies of?

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
You see, until then books
were printed by scribes who

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
had to hand write
them, which meant

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that only someone with an
enormous amount of money

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
could afford a book, or only
someone with an enormous amount

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
of money could finance the
creation of books, that

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is the church financing monks
who spent their life copying

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:24.240 align:middle line:90%
religious texts, the Bible.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So in 1455 and under the
Uranus Pluto conjunction,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Gutenberg develops a technology
that is used to print

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.900 align:middle line:90%
"the book." "The book."

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:42.050 align:middle line:10%
But during the next couple of
decades under the financing

01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:48.210 align:middle line:10%
of Cosimo Medici, under
the Florentine Renaissance,

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:52.850 align:middle line:10%
we have translations being made
by Marsilio Ficino, the court

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:57.320 align:middle line:10%
astrologer incidentally to the
Medici's, who translated Plato

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.990 align:middle line:10%
from Greek into Latin,
translated material that

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:05.090 align:middle line:10%
was snuck out of Constantinople
and brought into Italy,

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:08.410 align:middle line:10%
material called the Corpus
Hermetica, the secret teachings

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.370 align:middle line:10%
that came from some
indeterminate time passed,

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.370 align:middle line:10%
perhaps as far back as Egypt.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
This amazing material talked
about using amulets and chance

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.580 align:middle line:90%
and magic for healing.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was filled with
astrology and all kinds of stuff

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that the church was
not very happy about.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
However, this
amazing material met

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
the new technology,
the printing press,

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and it was diffused
all through Europe.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, this
fed what became

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
the Protestant Reformation.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Because people
began to learn that

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
there was more perceptions than
one perception of the Bible.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There were more ways of
looking at the universe.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, if we
bring this up to modern times,

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
we see the IBM System
36 coming into being

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
under the same alignment as
Gutenberg's printing press

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.330 align:middle line:90%
in 1455.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And then just a
few decades later,

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we see in 1993 the
flourishing of computers,

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
so that everyone owned
one, everyone had

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
access to the World Wide Web.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it
wasn't just about capitalism.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.990 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just about a
particular political point

01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.830 align:middle line:10%
of view.

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Information was flowing
all around the planet.

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was out of control
from those people who

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
thought they needed
to control it,

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.145 align:middle line:90%
just like the printing press.

01:03:37.145 --> 01:03:41.800 align:middle line:10%
By 1479, the Uranus
Neptune conjunction

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.580 align:middle line:10%
then, the church lost control
because information was being

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.560 align:middle line:10%
printed on the printing press.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So again, we see the
repeating patterns of history

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
as we look at them
through the rising

01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:00.100 align:middle line:90%
and falling of planetary tides.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
That instead of rising
and falling twice a day,

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
like the lunar tides,
the tide's of the ocean,

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
these tides rise and fall over
decades or over centuries.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to look at
history through this filter,

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
we begin to appreciate
that single events

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.700 align:middle line:90%
do not happen by themselves.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They always happen in a
fabric of continuity connected

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
to larger events in the past,
to unknown events of the future,

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.335 align:middle line:84%
and that through astrology
we get a different perception

01:04:29.335 --> 01:04:31.090 align:middle line:90%
of history.

01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
There's really no way that we
could overstate the enormity

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of the paradigm shift that
we just are beginning to put

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%
our toes into the tip of.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
We talk as if it's happened.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
We talk as if the
paradigm shift is here.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You hear that talk over and over
again in scientific circles,

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
in new age circles, in religious
circles, in spiritual circles.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter is
that the enormity of the Saturn

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Pluto alignment on
September 11, 2001,

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
coupled with its near
proximity to the Uranus Neptune

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
alignment in 1993,
coupled to its proximity

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to the Uranus Pluto
alignment in the mid '60s,

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
with Saturn there also, it's
going to take years, maybe

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
decades, maybe even
centuries, in order

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to grow into what this
particular shift is

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
really all about.

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
matter is that we

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:43.700 align:middle line:84%
have already begun to change in
the universe that we live in.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We used to live in a universe
that was apparently real.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:54.856 align:middle line:84%
The stargate that
we've slipped through,

01:05:54.856 --> 01:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
through the latter part of
the 20th century, in fact

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
has moved us into a wider realm
of electromagnetic frequencies

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that are infra and ultra to our
previous sensory mechanisms.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We are very
comfortable these days

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
in moving about in altered
time space dimensions.

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
My role as an astrologer is
an age old, honored role.

01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is that my job
is that of a magician.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The Magi, the
Zoroastrian Priests,

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
who found their way to the birth
of Jesus, were, in fact, Magi,

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
wise men.

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:45.040 align:middle line:90%
They were astrologers.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
They were studying
the sky at night

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
divine intervention

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:54.290 align:middle line:90%
manifested here on Earth.

01:06:54.290 --> 01:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
My job as an astrologer is too,
like the Magi, to do magic.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But the magic that I do, the
magic that we astrologers do,

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is not the cheap stage
tricks of making lions

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and tigers or cards disappear
or appear in the air.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Our magic is more subtle
and maybe more powerful.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Our magic is bending
space and time.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
What we are doing by this
little astrological journey

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
of our individual
minds is taking a trip

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state of reality
where time becomes something

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.440 align:middle line:90%
different than it normally is.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll return to our normal
lives and go about doing

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:38.940 align:middle line:90%
what we normally do.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
However, our perception
will have been altered.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's the role of
the astrologer, that's

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the role of astrology, is to
give us a framework, based

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
upon the movement
of the planets,

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see the mundane
world through a different set

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
of eyes, that once
and for all can

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.260 align:middle line:84%
help us on a path that moves
us into a new way of perceiving

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.830 align:middle line:90%
things.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
We have, in fact, moved
through the stargate.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.470 align:middle line:90%
We are in a different world.

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:11.760 align:middle line:90%
But we are not arrived yet.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
We, in some ways, are like
the children of Israel

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
wandering around in the desert
waiting for the old ways

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to die off before we can
really move into whatever

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.300 align:middle line:90%
it is that's next.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
We may not be the ones that
actually even move there,

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
but our children and our
children's children will.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's our generations,
however, that have dipped

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%
our toes into quantum pond.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.529 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
ripples in a quantum pond

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:47.689 align:middle line:84%
is that we do not know the
effects that they will have.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is not a
simple cause and effect

01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:55.319 align:middle line:84%
relationship, that was the
astrology of the Newton Empire.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
200 or 300 years ago,
astrologers believed in fate.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Fate is like the particle side
of the particle-wave duality.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We now know that planets
are not just particles.

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:10.620 align:middle line:90%
They're particles and waves.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Particle, fate.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.939 align:middle line:90%
Waves, free will.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So as we dip our toes
into quantum pond

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and watch these
ripples move out,

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
astrology, more
than anything else,

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
reminds us that our future
is not sealed in fate.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.569 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's sealed
in every little action

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that we take every time we
poke into that quantum pond.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Every action we
take has ripples.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.359 align:middle line:84%
And those ripples
have ramifications

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that build and come back
in the future in ways

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.979 align:middle line:90%
that today we do not know.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:47.029 align:middle line:90%
