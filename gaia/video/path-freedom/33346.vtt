00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
ROBERTA RICHMAN: This
is a tough-guy world

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and we have to control
all of their movement

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:10%
and their behavior
because that's

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.141 align:middle line:10%
the way you keep an
institution safe for everybody

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:10%
who lives in it.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We have everybody here,
murderers and rapists,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
sex offenders, drug
addicts, every body.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:90%
My name is Dennis.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm 52 years old.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.122 align:middle line:84%
I'm serving a 15-year sentence
for assaulting my wife.

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:90%
My name's Louis.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%
35.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Sold narcotics since
I was about 13 or so.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:90%
My name is Juan.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm 34 years old.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm here for a
second-degree murder.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Sadly, it's my charge.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:90%
My name is Salim.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm 39.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll be 40 soon.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was given a life term.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times what
lands people in prison

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and what brings
them back is a lack

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:10%
of good problem-solving skills
and good communication skills.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Fleet approached us asking if
he could do some work in here.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:84%
We were challenged
by our union wanting

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to know how we could possibly
bring an ex-offender in.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.231 align:middle line:84%
I served 14 and 1/2 years on
a 25-year no parole sentence.

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Having served for 14 years
boosts his credibility,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
boosts his credibility
with inmates.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.764 align:middle line:90%
How's your weekend?

00:02:30.764 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.216 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
When I got locked up, I really
hit a wall of just seeing

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the craziness of my
life path up until then

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and on the incredible selfish
decisions I've been making.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:90%
My son was nine years old.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
He was going to grow
up without his dad.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was just so deeply
full of remorse and regret

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that I just literally
started practicing meditation

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
like my hair was on fire.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.245 align:middle line:84%
So I became extremely motivated
to turn my life around.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I was living life
with this prison monk.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.405 align:middle line:84%
I was sourcing a meditation
group twice a week in a chapel.

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I started receiving
letters from prisoners

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
while I was in prison.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I had published some articles.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
People knew about me out
in the world a little bit.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And they started sending
some of these letters

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
to me thinking I would
know what to do with them.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the
education department.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I had access to a copy machine.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I would copy articles
out of books.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I put together
a little thing

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and I'd send it
off to a prisoner.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So it started off
that way, and I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
decided it was a much
bigger deal than I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
could do from my prison cells.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think we have
a co-creative relationship

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%
with our life.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%
We can't control other people.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't control life.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But is there is some
relationship between what

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:90%
we put out and what comes back?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Freedom before I came
here was just another word.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I had never been
to prison before.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
All you know is what
the media and the movies

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:90%
say about prison, you know.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Take care of yourself,
man, somebody

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to try to take
your manhood or something,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I thinking I'm going to come
in here and fight the world.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
In a prison like Marin,
there's a serious conflict

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
waiting around any corner.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's an environment
where people's

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
worst behaviors are just right
there, just under the surface.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
When I first came in,
fought with offices,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
would beat up anyone, would do
the unthinkable just because.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a vicious cycle because
once you come to prison,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
your life just keeps
tumbling, tumbling, tumbling.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a never-ending
wall that won't stop building

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
unless you find some way
to get over that wall

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
or at least in front of it.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
What circumstances did they
have to survive on the street

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring them to
where they are now?

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Do we want to save those lives?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Or do we want to discard them?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The crimes I committed, I
brought shame to not only

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:90%
myself but to those who I love.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm just really
trying to do something

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:90%
to get out of that cycle.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.375 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is giving us an
opportunity just to meditate

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
and connect ourselves.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's golden.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So sit up with
that good posture.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Just rest your
hands on your legs.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And just take a
moment to just feel.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought that
the people who survive

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
are so much stronger
than I could ever be.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I asked Fleet how he survived
and thrived the way he has.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
He credits meditation for
having given him the strength

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to live his life in prison and
come out not as much the worse

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:90%
for wear as most people do.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a release
date so I can only

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:90%
go home when they decide I can.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to live
day by day and that

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:90%
helped me to deal with prison.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And I could only do that
being in the moment,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:90%
being in the now.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.077 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like if I don't
like what's going on,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:90%
what can I do to shift it?

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:84%
If I don't like the
relationship I have with my boss

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
or with one of the
COs or something,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
could I approach that
person in a different way?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Can I get creative
about what I'm

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
doing to bring about a
shift in the way things are?

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, owning
my own situation.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:90%
So how do you resolve that?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I take a breath and
then I step back really--

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly get that
there's this whole thing there

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that they thought
was who they are.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reality they knew.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly they get to step
outside of that a little bit.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You just see the
lights go on and it's

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:90%
like this sudden illumination.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a mini
enlightenment of sorts.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's very powerful.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what keeps me coming in.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:10%
The reality of it is I'm living
life and meditation it has

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:10%
brought a new perspective in the
way that it gave me like a tool

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:10%
to really look inside myself
and change the way I am.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.630 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand
the value of what

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
they call the soft stuff.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes think
without the soft stuff,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much hard stuff
you have, you're bound to fail.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
You can live your life.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You can be yourself.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You can show others
that this isn't a place

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:90%
to breed a better criminal.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
This could actually be a place
to breed a better person.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:84%
You're here because the way
that you were didn't work.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.563 align:middle line:90%
So why not be better?

00:08:25.563 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
The people in prison are us.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
They're not monsters
and more importantly

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
whether we want them too or
not, they're getting out.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So do you want them
to come out angrier

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and meaner and more
dangerous than they

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
were when they came in?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to
do whatever you

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
can to change their
behavior while they're here?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
