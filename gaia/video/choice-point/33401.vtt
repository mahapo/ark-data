aligned themselves with

yourself what is it that

around us,

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:28.204 align:middle line:78%

think about the change, or
wish, or hope for the

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:32.275 align:middle line:78%
change; that we must become in
our lives the very things that
we choose to

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:36.646 align:middle line:84%
experience in our world. We
must become the healing

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:40.984 align:middle line:84%
we must become the cooperation,
we must become the peace, and

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:45.288 align:middle line:78%
to the best of our abilities

The fact is that change has to
start within
