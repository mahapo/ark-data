00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>On March 5, 1994,
Jose Escamilla

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
videotaped 16 minutes
of UFO footage

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight nine miles
south of Roswell, New Mexico.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
He thought this would be
the only UFO encounter he

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
and his family would ever have.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
14 days later, he
captured something

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
on videotape that would
forever change his life.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
He discovered something
flying in the skies that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
just didn't look normal.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
At first, he thought
they were insects flying

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:90%
close to the video camera.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
After a number of
tests, he found out

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
they were not insects.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He found out they
were not birds.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Instead, he discovered something
that will forever change

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:10%
the way we accept reality.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.787 align:middle line:84%
They are called rods, and they
are appearing everywhere all

00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:56.025 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:02:56.025 --> 00:03:00.975 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>What we found here at Midway
is an important discovery.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I think that
everyone in the world

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:10%
should realize that we
are being visited by--

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:10%
or we have among us
many objects that we

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:10%
feel are biological entities.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:10%
Although we've filmed a lot
of dome objects and things

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.146 align:middle line:10%
like this, there are objects
that are flying around,

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:10%
even over Roswell, called rods.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking everyone in
New Mexico, Texas, Arizona,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and people of all
over the world to film

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
on Christmas day,
a two-hour tape,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and put your time and date, as
you see on the screen there.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>And we're going to
see if these rods are

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:90%
found in other areas.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a rod right there.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:10%
These things are anywhere
from 50 to 100 feet long.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:10%
>>Incredible.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.362 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah.

00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:10%
At first I was kind of reluctant
to release information on rods,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:10%
because as you saw
there, I thought

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.102 align:middle line:10%
they were 100 feet long.

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And we just didn't know
enough about this phenomenon.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I had never
experienced it before.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the UFO object,
you see a disk shape.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.504 align:middle line:84%
All right, that
conforms with most

00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of the sightings that have
occurred over the last 50

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.797 align:middle line:84%
But rods were a total
different thing.

00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They looked like flying
snakes, and they were just

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.921 align:middle line:90%
kind of a little bizarre.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.336 align:middle line:84%
And I still had a little
doubt in the back of my mind

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
as to whether I was really
filming with the right shutter

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
setting and I was really
getting the right results.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until we got a hold
of a 1/10,000 shutter setting

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.395 align:middle line:84%
on the camera that we said, aha,
we now have absolute evidence

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
that these things are real.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Because now we've got insects
and birds shot at that shutter

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
setting, and now we have rods,
and there's a difference.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was born in
Wisconsin, grew up there,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:10%
moved out to Arizona,
been involved

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of crazy
things in my life,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.972 align:middle line:10%
managed to-- I'm a
pro skateboarder.

00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:46.245 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guys.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Jeff Ferris here for
Spohn Ranch, Incorporated.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:10%
Right now on the vert ramp.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Been making a living doing
that for most of my adult life.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But since I was a kid, I've
always been interested in UFOs.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had moved out
to Arizona and heard

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
about a convention,
a UFO convention,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:90%
that was coming into town.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to pack on
up and move on down there

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and check it out.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at a lot
of the different speakers,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.493 align:middle line:84%
the lectures and things
that were happening,

00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:23.874 align:middle line:84%
and I've always had an interest
in UFO footage, video footage,

00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
people that claim that
they've captured things

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:90%
on home video camcorder.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much
the only guy there

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be right
on the money with that

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
was Jose, the Midway
UFO sightings.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So I went, saw some fairly
amazing clips of daylight disks

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and little white
objects cruising around.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.064 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
showing me rods.

00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had never seen
anything like that.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It completely blew me away.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I was really intrigued.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely a complete
new phenomenon as far as

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
what I had seen
as far as UFOs go.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got involved
in the research.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:10%
>>I first got involved in the
phenomenon of rods back in '95

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:10%
when Jose Escamilla came up and
spoke for us at Colorado MUFON.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't able
to make his lecture.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And Galen Sharpe, one of
our section directors,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
had bought Jose's
video and brought it

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:90%
to the next directors meeting.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
After the meeting,
Galen said, hey,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I got something
really interesting I

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:90%
want to get your opinion on.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And he started playing
Jose's tape back,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and he basically fast-forwarded
through all this incredible UFO

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
footage and went straight
to the end of the video.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, what we
saw was these first rod shots

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%
that Jose had taken.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And with my background
and in the Army

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and looking at insects,
I thought that there

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
was something unusual there.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.907 align:middle line:84%
I definitely didn't recognize it
as anything I had seen before.

00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>And so I decided to
give it a shot myself,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
set up the camera
in the backyard

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:90%
for a period of two days.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
In December of 1994, I started
getting things, what I thought

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
looked really similar
to what he had captured.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So I sent off my
footage to Jose,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to scan
it, load into his computer,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.895 align:middle line:84%
and analyze it a
little bit better

00:07:01.895 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and basically told me that I was
capturing rods, the same thing

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that he had been taping,
which kind of brought up

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea that maybe
these are not unique to just

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:90%
one certain area.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.548 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is
something that can be

00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
found in other
countries, other states.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>The next state
meeting that we had,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Jose was there in the
audience, unbeknownst to me,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and I took the opportunity
to introduce myself to him

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.192 align:middle line:84%
and found out that he
had moved to Colorado

00:07:27.192 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and was now basically
a neighbor of mine.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.825 align:middle line:84%
He lived only about
10 minutes away.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So I took advantage
of that opportunity

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and asked Jose if I could
look at what he's got on rods.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.329 align:middle line:84%
And he was very gracious,
invited me over.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And that began a
period of time where

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.828 align:middle line:84%
I would go over about
two or three times a week

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
for about two or
three hours at a time

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and just had him start with
the very first rod footage

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and sat down over his
shoulder and looked at it

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:90%
all from the very beginning.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been very fortunate
in having James Peters work

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
with me, because up until
1995 when he came on board--

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was July
of '95 when he first

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
made the trip to my house
and he sat down with me

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and looked at all
the footage that I

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:90%
had accumulated at that time.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time,
I just had no clue.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm the type of guy who
just presents it as it is.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I tried to keep it, though,
in a biological sense.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Back as early as the
middle part of '94,

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I said it's a biological entity
of some kind, a living entity.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Jose was already getting
a little bit of flak,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:84%
particularly on the internet,
regarding the first rod shots.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the people
who were skeptics

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.524 align:middle line:84%
who were analyzing
what they were seeing

00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
were saying that
they were blurred

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:90%
images of insects and birds.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
some of the shots

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
were-- while I was convinced
that they were of rods,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
bugs and birds,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
they were so blurred that they
really didn't help the case,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't help the
argument otherwise.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>We wanted to make sure we
weren't just filming insects

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.203 align:middle line:90%
and birds from the get-go.

00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:53.292 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was back in 1994.

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
In the first video
that I released,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.375 align:middle line:84%
"Rods and Mysterious
Objects Among Us,"

00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I demonstrated how if you
shoot at a low shutter setting,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get an
insect that emulates a rod.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics have always come out,
and they try to debunk me,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:90%
and we covered every base.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.972 align:middle line:84%
Going in, I knew that
we would have to stay

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:90%
a step ahead of the skeptics.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they're going
to say, it's the planet Venus.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's always their out.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But that was eliminated
from day one.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Lens flares, we eliminated that.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.312 align:middle line:84%
We purposefully shot towards
the sun, and we let it roll,

00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, birds
would fly through,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
rods would fly through.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So we eliminated birds.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
We've eliminated
insects, of course.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And the critics today still want
to try to push that on this.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>So once we started
getting better footage in

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and the sky fishing
protocol started

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
being practiced by
more people and also we

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
started to get footage taken
by professional videographers

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
with better cameras,
then we started

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
getting more clarity and
resolution on the footage

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:90%
that we were getting.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it became very apparent
at that point that what we had

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.985 align:middle line:90%
was a very distinct phenomenon.

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>So once we got
that protocol set up,

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the sky-fishing protocol,
we started getting

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:90%
more and more people involved.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's been good,
because we now

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
have solid evidence
that these things,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting
to see a familiarity

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
in the way their flight
characteristics are.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.199 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they definitely have
a certain fly characteristic.

00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:90%
They don't fly through the air.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.129 align:middle line:90%
They swim through the air.

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
characteristic

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
than I'd seen before.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:90%
They're swimming.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're going
just as fast as fish.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call them
sky fish, because they're

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:90%
deliberate in their motion.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I started seeing
the footage of rods

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.907 align:middle line:84%
entering the water and coming
out of the water-- wow.

00:10:28.907 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:90%
That really did it for me.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.505 align:middle line:84%
It just totally blew me out
of the sky, so to speak.

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The Cave of the Swallow,
Sotano de las Golondrinas,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
amazing places

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I've ever been to in my life.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
This is definitely
one of the habitats

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:90%
that we know of in the world.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:10%
You have to fly to Mexico
City, catch a plane from Mexico

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:10%
City to Tampico Bay.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you drive two
and a half hours inland

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
towards the northwest to a
little town called Aquismon.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, Aquismon is
a little village.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's your typical
village of the Old West.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it's a one-hour
drive up the mountain.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
No matter how fast you go
up, no matter how slow it is,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it's always a one-hour
drive straight up.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
up from sea level

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
up to 2,900 feet
above sea level.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to take
another 20- or 30-minute jaunt

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
across rocky terrain and
an area where there's

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.254 align:middle line:90%
got wild dogs and things.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of Indian people

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.171 align:middle line:84%
that live out there
in the mountain.

00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.878 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
go another 20 minutes

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:90%
until you get to the cave.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you get there,
you can hear the swallows

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
as you get closer to the cave.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go
through this underbrush.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%
The underbrush is pretty thick.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like a jungle, you know.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And you get there, and
once you behold the scene,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
it's just like no other feeling.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.178 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just incredible.

00:11:48.178 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking up to an
unknown subterranean valley.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.797 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just get
this overwhelming feeling

00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
like you're in "Journey to the
Center of the Earth," you know?

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary pit in
Mexico called Sotano de las

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Golondrinas, which
literally translates

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
to Pit or Cave of the Swallows.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It in and of itself is just
an awesome geologic formation.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a vertical pit.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It has a sloped bottom.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
It is so immense that you can
literally take the Empire State

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Building and set
it inside this pit,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and no part of the
Empire State Building

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
would touch any of its sides.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And just as they leap off
of towers and buildings

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and bridges and
things like that,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
base jumpers are now leaping off
the lip of the cave as sport.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:10%
When I first got there for
the first time in 1999,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:10%
I was expecting to see rods
zipping by but in slow motion.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time, I'd
been looking at rods

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.459 align:middle line:90%
at the cave in slow motion.

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And I got there, and I
was disappointed because I

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.416 align:middle line:90%
couldn't see anything.

00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
All I saw was insects
and parrots and birds.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I started going, maybe
we misidentified this thing

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
after all.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.334 align:middle line:90%
I don't see rods.

00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the camera man that

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
was with me, the
TV camera guy, he

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
called me-- I had a
video camcorder here.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.539 align:middle line:90%
And he says, Jose, look!

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I glanced at him, and out
of the corner of my eye

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw this thing fly right
in front of me, just whoom!

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just reeled back,
and it was a rod-- not

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.306 align:middle line:90%
a bird, not a parrot.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:90%
It was not an insect.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.617 align:middle line:90%
It was a rod.

00:13:27.617 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
remembering and recalling

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:90%
how fast these things are.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're like bam,
bam, zipping right by me.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was just not
even registering

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that because I was so
used to and conditioned

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to seeing them in slow motion.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>What we want to
show you now are

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:10%
some of the specific video
clips that we show the best

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:10%
evidence for rods, showing it
as being a unique phenomena

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:10%
and not just a blurred
insect or a bird

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and in particular showing the
speed in which they travel

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:10%
and some of their flight
dynamics, which are not

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:10%
shared with bugs or
birds, which again

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:10%
is more evidence
for my hypothesis

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:10%
of what we're dealing
with here is a creature

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:10%
that's unique on this planet.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fly like
any other creature.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fly like insects.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fly like birds.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And it has a unique physiology
and physical structure

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.138 align:middle line:90%
unlike anything else we see.

00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
One shot that I like a
lot at the very beginning

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
when the very first cave
footage that we were getting

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
from Sotano de las Golondrinas
is a shot where a rod flies

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
over the shoulder
of the videographer

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and for a short while is flying
directly away from the camera.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's important in that is
that you see the rod maintains

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
its long shape
through the entire arc

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and curve of its
flight, which precludes

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
that its long shape is
actually a blurred insect.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not going
to get that blurring--

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
there's no motion blur
flying away from the lens

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:90%
or towards the lens.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And as the rod is
banking, it also

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
shows that it's actually
using aerodynamics.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It's pressing against the air.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It has to bank to make the turn.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can see some physical
features from this shot also

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that preclude it from
being an insect or a bird.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
When you see it
directly from the end,

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
you can see that its body, in
cross-section, in other words,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:90%
would be spherical.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the wings are
mounted directly

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:90%
out of the side of the body.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, both birds and
insects, their wings

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:10%
are mounted on the upper part
of the thorax near the top

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:10%
of their back, in other words.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And here, we see that these
wings are coming straight

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:90%
out of the side of the body.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So there you have
strong evidence

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
of the physiology of the rod
is different from an insect

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:90%
or a bird.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Also you notice that there
aren't any legs dangling

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:90%
down off of it, either.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The shot is clear enough that
if you had any antennae sticking

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
off the top or legs
hanging down off of it,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
as all insects do when
they fly, that they would

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
be very clear in the shot,
because the rod is brightly

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
lit in the sun, and
yet it's contrasted

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
in the dark background
of the cave,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and any legs would
be clearly seen.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
We have no problem
making out the wings.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And the rod finishes the turn in
this graceful bank in the shot

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and zips on out of the way.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it even gives you an
idea of its size because

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of its proximity to the camera.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So that one shot has
a lot of information

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can use, showing
that rods again are unique

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and to answer the
questions regarding

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
motion blur and misfilmed
insects and birds.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Another shot that we have
from the cave in Mexico

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is where the rod is
actually entering

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
the shadow of the cave.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, why this is
important is that we

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
have the base jumper
in the background,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
and so we have him as one
of our reference points.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that he's approximately
six foot in height.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that his speed is going
to be right around terminal

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
velocity, so anywhere
between like 90

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and maybe 120 miles an hour.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And at the same token, this
was taken in the afternoon,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:10%
and we have a shadow that's
being cast by the leading

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:10%
edge of the cave on the leading
edge that's closest to the sun.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And this shadow
is leaving a line

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
across the back
wall of the cave,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
so you can clearly see the
angle of the shadow falling

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:90%
through the mouth of the cave.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the base
jumper is in, like I

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
said, kind of in the
rear 2/3 of the cave

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
from the point of
the videographer.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can see him, that
he's still in daylight.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And between him and
the camera is a rod.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And yet the rod breaks
through the shadow

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:10%
that the cave is being cast.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is
significant because it

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:10%
means that the rod had to be
some distance from the camera.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
If it was too close
to the camera,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
it would not have been even
in the field of view at all.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:10%
For this rod to have been
caught in the shadow,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:10%
it had to be some
distance, most likely

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:10%
at least halfway the
distance between the camera

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:10%
and the base jumper for it to
even be seen entering a shadow.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.055 align:middle line:10%
Also, with the rod
entering the shadow,

00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:10%
we have one frame where you
can see about 3/4 of the rod

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:10%
is in shadow, and just a
last little section of it

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:10%
is still remaining
in the sunlight.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that was motion
blur, you would not

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
be able to get that effect.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
You would get a streaking
effect out of it.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:10%
So what we see is
basically we know

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:10%
we have a snapshot of a
cylindrical-shaped animal

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:10%
in this case.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:10%
And again, we also have the
base jumper in the background.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
He's not unusually
blurred, and we

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
know that he's traveling at
a high rate of speed also.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Maccabee was able to
make some calculations of this,

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and his rough calculations
were able to give us

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
an approximation to
the size of this rod.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And we filmed this particular
shot that on the small end,

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.572 align:middle line:84%
the rod was maybe
two feet in length.

00:19:13.572 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And on the large end, it
could have been easily

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:90%
four feet in length.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.472 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Another one of
our favorite shots

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
is where a swallow
gives chase after a rod.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sequence in
two different clips.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The first clip shows the
agility and the speed

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.341 align:middle line:90%
in which a swallow can fly.

00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
As you can see here,
the base jumper

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
takes a dive into the cave,
and here you see the swallow

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
as it emerges out
of its nest, which

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
is located at the side of the
cave wall there, the rock wall.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You can see the swallow
emerge out of its nest,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and it catches up,
almost catches up,

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to the base jumper, where
it nearly pecks its foot.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, what this shows us
the agility and the speed

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:90%
in which swallows can fly.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
As you can see here,
the base jumper

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
is probably reaching
terminal velocity,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
which is close to 90
to 100 miles an hour.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And a swallow is
able to go from zero

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to 90 practically and
within four or five seconds.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.937 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
fast and agile bird.

00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next sequence is
the full sequence, where

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:90%
the swallow chases after a rod.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, why this shot
is important is that,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
for one thing, we actually
show a bird and a rod

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:90%
flying side by side.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So obviously the rod is
not in this film a bird.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, you can see
the size of the rod

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is very close to the
size of the swallow.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So that means that it's not
an insect as we know it.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Swallows will eat insects, and
they catch insects on the wing.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
That's how they live.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, as you can see here, the
swallow comes out at an angle.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It leaves its nest,
which is located

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:90%
right under the bush here.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:10%
That's the swallow going to
the left, where the arrow is

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:10%
pointing, and there you
see the rod coming in,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
two total distinct shapes.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you see the rod travels
continuously under the bush.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The swallow all of a
sudden makes a U-turn

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and goes back towards
where the rod is flying.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.115 align:middle line:84%
And right about here
is where the rod senses

00:21:04.115 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:84%
it's being chased
and where the swallow

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
takes a dive at the rod.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And here you see
them both on the run.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>But here we have a rod that
actually changes its flight

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
path and is actually able
to out-fly, out-maneuver,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and out-accelerate the swallow,
which also precludes it

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
from being an insect, because
those are regular parts

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.847 align:middle line:90%
of a swallow's diet.

00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
naturally be able to catch

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:90%
an insect on the wing.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:33.922 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.922 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Another one of
our favorite shots

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
is where the base jumper
is falling into the pit,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and the rod flies in between
the camera and the base jumper.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:90%
The rod is in perfect focus.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So we get a lot more
clearer detail of the rod

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.437 align:middle line:90%
as it passes by.

00:21:48.437 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
our favorite shots,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
because we can actually
see the membrane

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
along both sides of the torso
that we've talked about.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is definitely
one of our best shots

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen of a
clear image of a rod.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:10%
>>What we have is a
professional videographer

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:10%
who is taking some
footage for the military,

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:10%
the Swedish military in Sweden.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was a proving
grounds where

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:10%
they're developing a new type
of rapid-firing light tank.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:10%
And this tank is capable
of firing rounds,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.092 align:middle line:10%
four rounds per second.

00:22:36.092 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:10%
And some of the
footage that he had

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:10%
taken, he had caught
rods at various times

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:10%
during the proving
grounds, where

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:10%
he's focused on this light tank
and rods were flying around.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:10%
But in this particular shot,
you have the tank at rest,

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:10%
and it's just a
firing demonstration.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:10%
And it fires off eight
shots in two seconds.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And as the tank
is firing, we can

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
see the shell casings
being ejected out

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
of the top of the
turret of the tank.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're very clear.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:10%
And while the projectile
itself is too fast

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:10%
to be caught by the motion, we
can see the dust being raised,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:10%
we can see the
recoil of the barrel,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:10%
and we can see these casings
flipping up and arcing

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:10%
through the air.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:10%
And while this
firing is going on,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:10%
we have a rod that
flies completely

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:10%
through the field of
view from left to right.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:10%
And it is so fast that
the casings are only

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:10%
moving probably about 8
inches to 12 inches in the air

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:10%
while the rod flies through
the entire field of view.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, why that's
critical is, number one,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:10%
we have a professional
videographer,

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:10%
who obviously knows his camera.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:10%
We can trust his
information that he gives us

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:10%
regarding his camera, his lens,
the speed, the conditions that

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:10%
were taken at the time.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:10%
We have information
regarding the tank, the speed

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:10%
of the film, frames per second.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:10%
And this is something we don't
normally get from an amateur

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:10%
with his camcorder
in his backyard.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:10%
So we have a quality camera
with a high resolution.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:10%
We have film that was actually
shot purposefully at high speed

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:10%
to capture the action of this
barrel and the shell casings

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:10%
as they're ejected
from this tank.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the rod flying
by the entire field of view.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So we get it in many
frames and many fields,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and it travels through
the full length of it.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Also another interesting
thing about this

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:10%
is that the object, the rod, is
flying by very near proximity

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:10%
to this cannon,
which is very loud,

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:10%
not only in decibels loud,
but also the actual pressure.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:10%
You can feel the pressure coming
off the barrel of this thing.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:10%
It's kicking the dust up off the
ground in front of the cannon.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:10%
It's rocking the tank
back with each shot.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet whatever this
is decides to fly

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:90%
right by the barrel of this gun.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I dare to say
what kind of bird

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.828 align:middle line:84%
would be attracted to
that kind of situation.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>One of my favorite
rod shots, of course,

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
is of the rods
entering the ocean

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and again showing the
uniqueness of the phenomena.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
There is no insect that
we know that will dive

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean of one thing.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Most aquatic insects, their life
cycles are with fresh water.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, this is the deep
ocean out near the Sargasso Sea.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And in this shot, we have
a loggerhead sea turtle,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
a juvenile that's
swimming about four feet

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:90%
below the surface of the water.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the cameraman is below
him and looking upwards.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>And you could see
a rod coming in,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming in like
this outside of the water.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.226 align:middle line:90%
And you see it hit the water.

00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It leaves a bubble
trail and enters in.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's about three or
four of them that just zip by.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're going just as
fast as rods do in the sky.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>And in rapid
succession, we see

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the water
break with these splashes

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and these pencil-thin
bubble trails

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
zipping through the
water, it looks almost

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:90%
like bullets hitting the water.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then coming down to about
the level of the camera,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
we see them level off and
shoot out to the right.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you slow them down,
what we're seeing in the ocean

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
we see in the air.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And basically, we have rods.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're catching them actually
entering from the atmosphere

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
peculiar that we

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
saw this, because
everything we saw

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.160 align:middle line:84%
about their physical
structure and how

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
they swim through
the atmosphere now

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
correlates with them actually
swimming through the ocean.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:10%
>>They're going just as fast as
rods do in the sky under water.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:10%
So it's an incredible phenomena.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Whatever these things are,
they have mastered the ability

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:10%
to travel through both
mediums as if there's

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:10%
nothing really there, just like
traveling through dimensions.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.113 align:middle line:84%
No telling what these
things are going

00:28:30.113 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to teach us once
we catch a specimen

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and investigate
what its makeup is.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>I think what we have here
is an example like we've

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:90%
seen with the penguin.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And we know in a penguin that
what it uses for flippers today

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
were structures that
were originally developed

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:90%
for flight in the air.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And as it's now evolving into
a more aquatic lifestyle, what

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
used to be wings for
flying in the air

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
are now turning into
flippers or wings

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:90%
for flying through the ocean.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And I think with the
rod, what we have here is

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:10%
a species that at one
time was purely aquatic,

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:10%
but as it became
airborne through more

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:10%
of its lifecycle, what it
used as fins for swimming

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:10%
through the ocean it is now
using its fins for swimming

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:10%
through the air.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that
its structure,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:84%
its physical structure, serves
equally as well in the water

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:90%
as it does in the air.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>This was a critical
thing for rods,

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:84%
because when I was
first looking at rods,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing what
we were calling

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
the centipede rods,
which usually had kind

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:84%
of almost like balls
of light running down

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:90%
the side of the body.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And then others rod
shots where we'd

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
get like four bright areas on
one side of the body and three

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:90%
on the other.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.770 align:middle line:10%
And then in the next frame,
there would be different ones.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going like--
at one time we thought

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:10%
that they had fins running
out going through their body

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:10%
or wings running down
the length of the body.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going, that's not
what the data is telling us.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we look at
this, one frame to the next,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the physical structure
was being different.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I
mean, I knew there's

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
got to be something
that would explain

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:84%
what we're seeing in every
shot no matter what angle,

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the
light was like.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
There had to be something there.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting behind Jose, and
next to his computer monitor,

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:90%
he had an eagle feather.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
that eagle feather,

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and I saw how the feathers
in the quill were aligned.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's it.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:90%
That will do it.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
That will explain what
we're seeing-- not that it's

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
a feather, but that
outline of the structure,

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you had
a cylindrical body,

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and then from the body
coming out along the sides,

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
you had one single
fin, not a bunch

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of individual little
fins, but one single fin.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And if that fin was translucent,
which was basically invisible,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
allowed the light
to pass through it.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.347 align:middle line:90%
But it was an undulation.

00:30:54.347 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Then what would happen
is that it would just

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.837 align:middle line:84%
catch the light
from certain angles

00:30:57.837 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
so that you would
get a reflection off

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:84%
of it just through
certain parts of the humps

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of the undulations.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if the light was
passing through the fin,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:84%
it would be a little bit more
opaque because of the angle

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and the amount, the
refraction of the light.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.342 align:middle line:84%
From another angle,
the fin would overlap,

00:31:15.342 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and so it would show
up as a bright spot,

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.925 align:middle line:84%
too, because now you
were looking through two

00:31:18.925 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:90%
fins instead of one.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Finally we had a
model for a rod that

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
would explain all of the
shots that we were getting.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
No matter who took it
and where it was taken

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and what the lighting conditions
were, we could now make it fit.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Searching back in
history, the closest analog

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.995 align:middle line:84%
in which an animal
kept its body stiff

00:31:49.995 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and had wave fins on
the side that moved

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
would be Anomalocaris, which
was the dominant predator

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.841 align:middle line:90%
during the Cambrian period.

00:31:57.841 --> 00:32:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The phylum died out at the
end of the Cambrian period,

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and people thought
it was extinct.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But it might just possibly
still be alive in rods.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Anomalocaris was a large
creature that was a predator.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
It was on the top
of its food chain.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It was very agile, and it
swam using the same method

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:84%
of propulsion that
we see rods use

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to not only swim
through the ocean

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:90%
but to swim through the air.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It had a series of
paddle-like appendages

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and ran down a body that
overlapped each other.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And it used this undulatory
method of propulsion

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.557 align:middle line:84%
that we see also, for
example, in cuttlefish today

00:32:33.557 --> 00:32:34.720 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Anomalocaris was
large and also seemed

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to be almost the same
size that we do see

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
rods, one, two feet in length.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
thing about Anomalocaris

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is that some believe that it is
a phylum that became extinct.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.270 align:middle line:84%
What we might see, actually,
is that Anomalocaris,

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
while being a very
successful life form

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that existed for over 100
million years in our oceans,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
actually didn't become
extinct but maybe evolved

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.070 align:middle line:90%
into another form.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
The one reason why we're
intrigued about this idea

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is by the work of a Dr.
Robin Wootton out of Exeter

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:90%
University in England.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.787 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wootton came up with
a hypothetical creature

00:33:13.787 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:90%
called the protopterygote.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm of the opinion
that what rods are,

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:10%
are the world's
first flying organism

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:10%
and an ancient, long thought to
be extinct insect that actually

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:10%
represents a missing link
in the world of entomology

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:10%
and paleontology.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
What you basically
have is when people

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:84%
look at the evolution
of insect flight

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and how insects went from just
being terrestrial creatures

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that crawled with legs to
aerodynamic creatures that

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.560 align:middle line:84%
actually could take and make
the atmosphere their domain,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
the question exists of, how
in the world did that happen?

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Wootton out of Exeter
University in London,

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:84%
he's come up with a hypothetical
creature, what he thought

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:84%
would be the ancestor
of today's insects.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:10%
He calls it protopterygote.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:10%
This is a creature that
he says existed probably

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.190 align:middle line:10%
350 million years ago.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:10%
>>We have the
protopterygote model,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:10%
which is a hypothetical
creature that

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:10%
could show you the physical
form, the physical type

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:16.050 align:middle line:10%
of the ancestor of winged
insects as a viable shape

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:10%
for an organism.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it's
viable aerodynamically.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:84%
They actually made gliders and
have flown these little models

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of the protopterygote to
show that they do glide

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and they have stability
and they're aerodynamically

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:90%
worthy of flight.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>This missing link actually
was aerodynamic but not winged.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:84%
So the idea there
is that rods could

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
have taken to the atmosphere
since they're the longest

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.553 align:middle line:84%
and most evolved aerodynamic
species in the world,

00:34:44.553 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:84%
that they quite
possibly could have made

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere their
domain and never

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:84%
had a reason to come back to
being a terrestrial creature.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>And when you apply
evolution to the equation,

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.790 align:middle line:84%
protopterygote could have
started with little winglets

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:84%
but evolved into
a solid membrane.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>And I believe that that's
where the rod's mystery lies

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
in the world of pragmatic
science and evolution,

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.056 align:middle line:90%
paleontology.

00:35:07.056 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And that those
are the people who

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:84%
have to really help answer the
question of what rods might be,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
because I really think
that that's the key.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>In any circumstance,
one thing this does

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
show that this is
a model that nature

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.910 align:middle line:90%
has engineered in the past.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not too far-fetched
that something like this

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
could still exist in
our environment today.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.960 align:middle line:10%
>>Oh, well, the impact
for human technology,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.150 align:middle line:10%
if we find that these
creatures fly in the manner

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:10%
that we think they do, it opens
up a whole other possibility

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:10%
for flight surfaces.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally
different from birds.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It's totally different
from insects.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
They use a basic thing.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
swimming through the air

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
through very fast action of
the membrane along the sides.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.272 align:middle line:84%
It allows possibilities for
technological development.

00:35:56.272 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Since most of the technology
we have right now is basically

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
imitations of natural
phenomena or natural things,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:84%
we would have another
model on which we could

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:90%
develop future technologies.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>At the Georgia Tech
Research Institute,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:84%
a Dr. Robert Michelson
and his design team

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
are working on a micro,
unmanned, aerial vehicle that

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
could actually be used
as a robotic probe

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.840 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere of Mars.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
This micro vehicle,
aerial vehicle,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a
long, cylindrical body,

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be powered
by a chemical muscle.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And this chemical
muscle is going

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.084 align:middle line:84%
to drive a pair of wings,
one pair of wings mounted

00:36:36.084 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
at the front of the body and
another pair of wings mounted

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:90%
in the back.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But you have basically the
same design of the rod model.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that
we have a long, undulatory fin

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.675 align:middle line:84%
running down the
side of the body,

00:36:47.675 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%
while they have these
two separate wings.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look at
the surface area of their wings

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and rand them down the length
of the side of the body,

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
you would basically have same
surface area or wing area

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.270 align:middle line:90%
that we're showing with rods.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And what they're saying
is that this model,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:84%
this aerodynamic
model, is so efficient

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that it would be able to propel
this robotic probe in the very

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
thin, rarefied
atmosphere of Mars.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
that model has

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to be a very efficient
mode of flight.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think that also gives
more credibility and showing

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.060 align:middle line:90%
that the rod model is viable.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>I have seen the films.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I've seen the evidence.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.950 align:middle line:10%
I've talked to
several people that

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:10%
have been involved with rods.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
belongs in this study.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:90%
The UFO mystery is broad.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of things
causing UFO sightings,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:90%
sighting reports.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Rods is probably one of them.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:10%
The evidence I've seen
is kind of overwhelming.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:10%
You get video after
video after video

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:10%
of very strange things flying
around in our air, some of them

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.577 align:middle line:10%
very rapidly, some of them
large, some of them small.

00:37:52.577 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:10%
We're dealing with
a mystery, and it's

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.430 align:middle line:10%
part of the science of
studying these things.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And rods are important
to us as a result.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:10%
>>We could go into the
background of eliminating

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:10%
certain things, but
the bottom line for me

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:10%
right now is I think that they
are a newly discovered type

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:10%
of living organism
that's kind of flying,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.904 align:middle line:10%
or maybe a better
word is swimming.

00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if they're
very light or what they are,

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.680 align:middle line:10%
but they seem to be
swimming like fish

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:10%
swim in water, except
they're swimming in the air.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.118 align:middle line:84%
They go very fast so that
people don't see them.

00:38:21.118 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:10%
>>So in your personal
opinion, Roger,

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:10%
what do you believe this
discovered life form to be?

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:10%
>>As to what a rod is,
my own personal belief

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.950 align:middle line:10%
is that it's a
life form, and it's

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:10%
a life form that has
not been described

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:10%
in our own earthly
environment before,

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:10%
primarily because it's very
difficult to see and maybe even

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:47.922 align:middle line:10%
capture.

00:38:47.922 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>It's also been reported
that some of this rod activity

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
has been seen during
UFO sightings.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there could
be in connection with this?

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just
purely coincidental?

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:10%
>>If the major
premises is that rods

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.720 align:middle line:10%
are part of our
natural environment

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:10%
and UFOs are craft
that are piloted

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:10%
by pilots from somewhere else,
it's two different things.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps more rods are seen
during periods of UFO activity

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's some kind
of electromagnetic changes

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere which cause
our visual acuity to reach

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we can see them.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Investigating
the rod phenomenon,

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
it's been very important
to keep an open mind

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and to take in the totality of
all the evidence that we have.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to the
video footage that we have,

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:90%
we also have moving film.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We have still film showing that
it's not just a video artifact,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:84%
a trick of the CCDs and
the video cameras that

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.210 align:middle line:90%
are causing this.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not an electrical
artifact of any kind.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether the camera
is film or video

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
has no change in the
phenomena showing up

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.380 align:middle line:84%
or the types of lenses
that are being used.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:10%
The evidence shows that
rods exist in both mediums.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is also
the eyewitness testimony

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have, not only in
our personal sightings,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
but those unsolicited
reports that

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:84%
have come in where we
see unique features,

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
physical features of the
rods, unique characteristics

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:84%
about how they move,
things that we've

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:84%
suspected privately but
never released publicly

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and yet people are reporting
on a consistent basis, which

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
just is more evidence to me
that we have a real creature

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:84%
out there that these
people are coming across

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:90%
in their day-to-day lives.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
We have numerous accounts
of people seeing things,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.140 align:middle line:84%
running across
strange creatures.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And they've wondered
what it is they've seen.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And these accounts go
many years back and even

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to include petroglyphs
that we have

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
found reports of in Argentina.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, these petroglyphs
are easily 1,000,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.040 align:middle line:90%
maybe even 1,500, years old.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And side by side,
these rock carvings

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
are next to other carvings of
where the shaman of that area

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:84%
would go up and have
their vision quests.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And we see some of
the classic spiral

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:84%
patterns and other designs and
anthropomorphic figures carved

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:90%
in the rocks.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And then right next
to them are what have

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:90%
to be basically rod shapes.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
If anybody was to draw a rod,
we have many different versions

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.126 align:middle line:84%
of rods being drawn
on these rocks.

00:41:34.126 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:10%
>>I know these films are totally
authentic and well taped,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:10%
well researched.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The teams that have gone in and
done them are excellent teams.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.455 align:middle line:84%
So I say, yeah, we got a mystery
here that's worth following.

00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:10%
>>The secrets and the answers to
this whole mystery, I believe,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:10%
lie in the proper use
of high-speed cameras,

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:10%
proper knowledge of the
history of ancient insects

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:10%
and the evolution of insect
flight, and the identification

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:10%
into this kind of missing
link in the biological world.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where the keys will

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:90%
be to unlocking this mystery.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>>What you found is
really what's out there.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:10%
And what's out there seems to
be maneuvering and changing

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.080 align:middle line:10%
direction and seems
to be some kind of-- I

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:10%
don't know if what you'd call
is intelligence, but at least

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:10%
some kind of living organism
that follows its instincts.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you've come
across a new life form that

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:84%
swims in the air,
that usually flies

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:90%
so fast that we can't see it.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>>For science to accept
rods as a real thing,

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.392 align:middle line:10%
we basically need a specimen.

00:42:35.392 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cameras
are good, and I've

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:84%
seen many, many videos in
the right situation that

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.850 align:middle line:84%
show that there's something
there that really can't be

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.810 align:middle line:90%
explained by birds or insects.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But science really demands
the ultimate proof,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and that would be a specimen.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>>The end will come.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:10%
This will culminate when they
actually have a rod, perhaps

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.720 align:middle line:10%
a dead one to start
and then a living one,

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:10%
so that it can be studied.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
information will be out,

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we get
the acknowledgements

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that they deserve for
discovering a new life

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:90%
form in our environment.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:10%
>>I think probably
in the coming year,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:10%
we're going to make
huge breakthroughs.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:10%
And that's all going to
be in part from everyone

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.370 align:middle line:10%
out there, people
that are joining us.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an interest in
this, tell everyone about it.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Make it known.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.164 align:middle line:90%
Tell your friends about it.

00:43:26.164 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Start videotaping on your own.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:10%
>>I'd like to see the
rod's research progress

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.700 align:middle line:10%
to the point where not only do
we have individuals who pursue

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:10%
this and with their own
ideas, their own equipment,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:10%
trying out new ways
to capture rods,

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.750 align:middle line:10%
not only with video technology,
but also to physically capture

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:53.745 align:middle line:10%
one, coming up with ideas to
build traps or other devices

00:43:53.745 --> 00:43:55.235 align:middle line:10%
to where we can get a specimen.

00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And we're hoping
that people will

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:10%
be able to go out and on their
own find a little bit of nature

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:10%
in their backyard, so to speak,
with this strange phenomena

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:10%
that seems to have been living
right under all our noses

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:10%
all these years.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And who knows that somebody
who is seeing this video

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:10%
will be the next one to
actually capture a rod

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.880 align:middle line:10%
or get the next big
breakthrough in rods research.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And we'll all benefit from it.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.006 align:middle line:10%
>>So the rods are an
incredible phenomenon.

00:44:22.006 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:10%
It's something that definitely
has to be addressed.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The scientific
community is going

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:26.618 align:middle line:90%
to wake up one of these days.

00:44:26.618 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I do think there's probably
a possibility of a specimen

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:84%
actually in some jar somewhere
and classified as an unknown.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to definitely get
a specimen in our possession,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be
the coup de grace for us.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.636 align:middle line:84%
>>During the production
of this program,

00:44:42.636 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:84%
an alleged rod specimen was
submitted to Jose Escamilla

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:50.364 align:middle line:84%
by an eyewitness who claimed to
have killed a rod in her home.

00:44:50.364 --> 00:44:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Although we have
searched for a specimen

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of a rod for many years,
until further tests are

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:84%
done with DNA and
other types of study,

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.210 align:middle line:84%
this particular specimen
remains as an unknown.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The following is
coverage of the specimen

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
as it was delivered
to Jose Escamilla

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.323 align:middle line:84%
and a preliminary examination
being done by James Peters.

00:45:10.323 --> 00:45:13.221 align:middle line:84%
The narrative is of
the original email

00:45:13.221 --> 00:45:14.831 align:middle line:84%
sent to Jose
Escamilla describing

00:45:14.831 --> 00:45:18.051 align:middle line:90%
how the specimen was acquired.

00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>"When I first saw it,
I was in my living room,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and as most of my
furnishings are dark in color

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and this thing is
light in color.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It would zip past
my line of sight,

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and it was way faster
than a housefly.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:84%
What convinced me was
on the third evening.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I caught its movement out
of the corner of my eye.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself,
just sit real still

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and see what this
thing's going to do.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:84%
"The next day, I sat down with
my dinner to watch the tube,

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and I felt something flutter
up the side of my knee.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I brush-swatted it
in an upward motion.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:84%
There on the top of my
knee was this thing.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.615 align:middle line:84%
One end looked like it
had a suction cup on it.

00:45:56.615 --> 00:45:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I had mangled it up pretty good.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I knew the second I saw it that
I had killed this living thing.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.240 align:middle line:90%
"I just sat there looking at it.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was important
to save, so I put it

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:84%
in the freezer for
three days until I

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:90%
contacted Jose Escamilla."

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The first thing you can see
is this is a medical sampling

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.375 align:middle line:90%
container.

00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:90%
It's used for specimen samples.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is marked
as being sterile,

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.700 align:middle line:84%
so we shouldn't worry about
any contamination of anything

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.100 align:middle line:84%
else other than the
specimen itself.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.554 align:middle line:84%
And you can see there's
nothing inside the lid.

00:46:33.554 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the container
itself, apparently it's

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:90%
wrapped in this gauze.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go ahead
and pull the gauze out.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can see there's
nothing left in the container

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and there doesn't seem to
be any liquid or any pieces

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.360 align:middle line:90%
of any kind.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.980 align:middle line:90%
So open this up here.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going to go ahead
and start my recording on this.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:07.060 align:middle line:90%
So specimen is open now.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It's brownish in color.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Really hard to say at first
look what it might be.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet according to the
person who captured this,

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:25.630 align:middle line:84%
it landed on their leg, and
they rubbed it with their hand.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.774 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.774 --> 00:47:31.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to go ahead
and take this sample

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and put it on the paper.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.905 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a small,
brown speck still here.

00:47:47.905 --> 00:47:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if I can get that off.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle line:84%
You can see the gauze
seems to be clean

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:84%
now, nothing on the other side
of it or on the other piece

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.600 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:10%
OK, well at face
value right now,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.634 align:middle line:10%
we are working off
of one assumption,

00:48:02.634 --> 00:48:04.300 align:middle line:10%
and that is that
according to the person

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:10%
that sent us this specimen
that it's the entire organism,

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:10%
what's left.

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And so as long as it's not
just a part of something

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.360 align:middle line:84%
larger, what we
can see is a lack

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
of any physical
structure that would

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.330 align:middle line:90%
indicate that it's an insect.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It is rather desiccated.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It's rather dried out.

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But we can see that the
exoskeleton of an insect

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:32.850 align:middle line:84%
should still be identifiable,
either with a head, thorax,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.490 align:middle line:90%
abdomen, legs, wings, antennae.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't see any of
those physical structures

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:90%
here at all.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, on the graph paper,
what we're looking at here

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is the grid is in
one-inch increments split

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.700 align:middle line:90%
into tenths of an inch.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So the large squares
are one-inch square.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The small squares are ten
small squares to inches.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.710 align:middle line:90%
So those are tenths of an inch.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to the
witness who captured this,

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:05.350 align:middle line:84%
this object was originally
2 and 1/2 inches long.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
witness, this pen cap

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:13.060 align:middle line:84%
here would have been very close
to the original length of what

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.450 align:middle line:84%
we are seeing now in this
dried-up, desiccated sample.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's gone from
this to this, which

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:25.970 align:middle line:84%
would indicate that if this was
the entire specimen, that there

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:32.162 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a whole lot as
far as its original mass.

>>A Japanese
television network had

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.100 align:middle line:84%
agreed to do a DNA test
on a part of the specimen,

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.700 align:middle line:84%
but they were unable
to get results

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.940 align:middle line:84%
done in time for the release
of this presentation.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:84%
The specimen is
in the possession

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of Jose Escamilla
and James Peters,

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as the
tests are done,

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:07.829 align:middle line:84%
we will publish the results with
all materials on the Roswell

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:08.629 align:middle line:90%
Rods website.

>>So the only thing
that's left, Jeff,

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is to find a good
position to put the camera

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and let her roll.
