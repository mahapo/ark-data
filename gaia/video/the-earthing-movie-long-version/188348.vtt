00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In simple terms, grounding
is literally putting your bare

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:90%
feet on the ground.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you're
in contact with the Earth,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and Mother Earth is
endowed with electrons.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And these electrons
are literally

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:90%
absorbed through your feet.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:10%
It's like taking
handfuls of antioxidants,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:10%
but you're getting
it through the feet.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Grounding means connecting
to the Earth to support

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
the specific function of
the organs of your body.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:10%
It supports the body as a
whole, but it specifically

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:10%
supports organ systems
down to the tissues

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:10%
and the cellular function
of the entire body.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Grounding provides a steady--

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:10%
we call it a ground plane.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:10%
It's like lying
naked on the Earth.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But where I come from, in the
winter, you can't do that.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
All the systems in the body, all
of them that we've measured--

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and we've measured just about
everything you can think of--

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
everything goes to balance, to
normal, when you're grounded.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%

is Clint Ober.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, Clint, first of all, we're
super honored to have you here.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Your book has been
everywhere, and everyone

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:90%
has been telling us about it.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a phenomenon.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's also kind
of hard to believe.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:10%
I have to confess, when I
first heard about earthing,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:10%
I was super skeptical.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:10%
So is that a common reaction
that you get from people?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.142 align:middle line:90%
And I was myself.

00:06:18.142 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It took me 20 years to
dig this out of the dirt

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.592 align:middle line:90%
and get it to the world.

00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And I questioned it all
the way because it just

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
didn't make sense.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the main reaction
you get from people when they

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.965 align:middle line:90%
get this information?

00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The response has been pretty
much a lot of skepticism,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds absurd.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
How can I just take my shoes
off, put my feet on the ground,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:90%
and reduce inflammation?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the world has been
about everything from oatmeal

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.957 align:middle line:90%
to blueberries to you name it.

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things
you can talk until you're

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.328 align:middle line:84%
blue in the face, but
until you experience it,

00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to believe it.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But once you experience it,
then the biggest trouble you

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
have is trying to explain
it to somebody else.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.412 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
naysayers, like most

00:06:58.412 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of the guys say, well,
if this were true,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I would have known about this.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I would've heard about this.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.155 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would
have told us this.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
This can't be something brand
new that we don't know about.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just say, I'm sorry,
it is something new.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something--
we accidentally

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from the
Earth, meaning for everybody

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to be able to wear shoes.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.207 align:middle line:84%
Inexpensive shoes, that
was a real advancement.

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
nobody knew the consequence

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
for the side effects
of losing our ground,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
losing our electrical
ground with the planet.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I grew up around Native American
people, primarily the Cheyenne

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and the Crow.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:84%
My dad died when
I was quite young,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
but I remember even
before he died,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have a lot of money
or a lot of material things.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.252 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But in the Native
American culture,

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
it was very interesting
that nobody owns anything.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:90%
You can't own land.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't own trees.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.685 align:middle line:90%
How can you own this?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And then there
was an event where

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
one of my friend's sister,
a little Indian girl had,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was scarlet fever.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.172 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.172 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
She'd been to the doctors
and all that kind of stuff,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.063 align:middle line:90%
and she wasn't getting well.

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And they brought her
home, and there was

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:90%
nothing they could do for her.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.916 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was real
traumatized by it.

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of the
elders, they dug a pit.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And put a little bit of
straw in it, whatever.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And they put her in the
ground, on the Earth.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Built a fire there and
just sat with her for days.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing we knew,
she was up, running around.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:90%
She was OK.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.565 align:middle line:84%
It was just awesome,
just totally awesome.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:10%
There are many things that
kind of stuck in my memory

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:10%
as I got older,
and one of them was

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.665 align:middle line:10%
I remember coming
home one day, and we

00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:10%
were going to go into one of the
kid's teepees with his parents.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said,
take your shoes off,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.198 align:middle line:90%
they'll make you sick.

00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Why she would say they
would make you sick,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.657 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have had
a clue at that time.

00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out that today, we
Americans don't spend a whole

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
lot of time grounding.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
That may have something to
do with our love of shoes.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about your relationship
with your feet and shoes.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I wear them.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Shoes?

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:90%
I love shoes.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more of an addiction.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.207 align:middle line:10%
>> Pretty much need
them for everything,

00:10:39.207 --> 00:10:41.273 align:middle line:10%
unless you want to stub
your toe everywhere.

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like your shoes
kind of represent you.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
How I feel anyway.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.067 align:middle line:84%
>> You got to get
the shoes first,

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
then that matches the outfit
that's going to go with it.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You can never just--
it's not clothes first,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:90%
then shoes later.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's shoes first, then clothes.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my biggest thing.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:10%
I stub my toe every day.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How many pairs do
you think you have?

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of Doc
Martens alone, I have 10.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god, no.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe 10, but only a
few pairs that I like.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say 50 or
60 pairs of shoes.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you guys ever
heard of grounding?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Do I know much
about grounding?

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.816 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I have two kids.

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I ground them all the time.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Grounding?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's like, um--

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:90%
spiritually--

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Connecting?

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Becoming more grounded
and connected to the Earth.

00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some people who
think that walking barefoot

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
could bring some
health benefits.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh, I agree but disagree.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a load of baloney.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.728 align:middle line:84%
>> When you go barefoot,
and you touch the warm sand,

00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
or you go to the ocean,
it just feels better.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Your body feels more
calm or something.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the benefit, if
we could, would give me,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.645 align:middle line:84%
me personally, more a
connection to my life,

00:11:56.645 --> 00:11:58.645 align:middle line:84%
to all the life around
me, you know what I mean?

00:11:58.645 --> 00:12:00.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that you
think of it, I mean,

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
when I go barefoot maybe
at the house or something,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:90%
it feels nice.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe that's this
thing that we have,

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
is things that we don't
even recognize, like shoes,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.947 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel like more
people could benefit from being

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:90%
grounded?

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, for sure.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's healthy.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It's healthy.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually got yelled at
a lot by my parents because I

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:84%
would try to go barefoot
everywhere, even in the snow.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Barefoot's, like-- for me,
I just don't feel comfortable,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I guess you can say.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just not really my trend.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I went through a mall
barefoot because my shoe broke.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> He loves to try to
sleep with the shoes on.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.118 align:middle line:90%
Like, shoes off the bed.

00:12:42.118 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> What helps you get grounded?

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Good shoes.

00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:48.916 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.415 align:middle line:84%
>> But shoes haven't always been
such a big part of our culture.

00:12:56.415 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.155 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:90%
What's the deal with these?

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:10%
>> America makes
synthetic rubber.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
This kind, one of two principal
types, is called Buna-N.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Mix the chemical
thoroughly and--

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1960, we invented
synthetic materials.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
we did was we put

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
rubber sole, or synthetic
soles, on the shoes.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Come on, boys and
girls, and follow me.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm Swifty Flyer.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:10%
I jump 10 feet in my PF Flyers--

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:10%
the shoes that winners choose.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A big event happened, and
I call it the Nike generation,

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.143 align:middle line:84%
the Adidas generation, the
tennis shoes generation.

00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
We started wearing sneakers.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
95% of people walk
insulated on the Earth.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the most common sense
thing that we are organisms

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that live, and grow, and depend
entirely on the Earth while

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:90%
we're alive.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have completely
isolated ourself from it.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
We're so disconnected that it
becomes this weird thing if we

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:90%
actually slip our shoes off.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> You've heard it before,
celebrities are just like us.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:10%
Or are they?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:10%
Elle Fanning did
something the other day

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:10%
that probably a lot
of you may not do.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:10%
The 18-year-old actress landed
at LAX airport late one night,

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:10%
looked pretty comfortable.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.615 align:middle line:10%
But it was what she
wasn't wearing that was

00:14:43.615 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:10%
getting people's attention.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:10%
She walked barefoot
throughout the airport.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the single thing
that happened that probably

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
caused the proliferation of
inflammation-related health

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.036 align:middle line:84%
disorders, far and
above anything else.

00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoo.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most destructive
invention that man ever made--

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:90%
the synthetic sole shoe.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> This is so incredible.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.942 align:middle line:90%
This is Nobel Prize material.

00:15:18.942 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, what we're
trying to demonstrate,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.442 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to
demonstrate here,

00:15:22.442 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is to show that when you
stand barefoot on the Earth,

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and you touch the Earth,
that your body is conductive.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And what this is is
basically a continuity meter.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is
plug it into the Earth like so.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
put my hand on it.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here, my
finger on the back of it,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:84%
you can see that the
light turns green,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and that means
that I'm grounded.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate this, Sam here is
wearing a pair of tennis shoes.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And when he puts it
on, he turns it on,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
he's not grounded.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But because I am grounded,
I am barefoot on the Earth,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
when I touch Sam, he
is naturally grounded.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:90%

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> December 7, 19--

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Like many great discoveries,
Clint Ober stumbled onto

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
grounding as a result of an
unusual sequence of events.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.985 align:middle line:84%
>> I got involved in the cable
industry in the early '60s.

00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I first learned the need
to ground cable signals

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
as we were developing
the industry.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
When you run a wire
into the house,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
before you can go
into the house,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
you have to ground the cable.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:10%
Grounding is to maintain
the entire system

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:10%
in a stable electrical
environment.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
You have miles of wire
hanging up there in the air.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
If there's lightning in the air,
it's going to hit the cable.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:10%
And so what you want
to do is create a path

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:10%
to ground for the
lightning so that it

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:10%
doesn't enter the house, or blow
up the TV, or create a fire.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:10%
So any electrical event is
maintained at Earth potential,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:10%
automatically equalized with
the Earth and eliminated,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.155 align:middle line:10%
neutralized.

00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Clint had a background
in the cable TV industry,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and he knew that cables that
come to your home with TV

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
programs have to be grounded.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
If they're not, two
things can happen.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:90%
You get snow on the screen.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:90%
The picture is terrible.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other is you get a knock
on the door from the Federal

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Communications Commission
because the signal is

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
disturbing aircraft
communication.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:10%
It leaks into the environment.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Just as ungrounded
signals wreak havoc on radio

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:10%
communications, there's growing
concern that because we are not

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:10%
grounded, we absorb tremendous
amounts of electromagnetic

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:10%
radiation from our
modern devices.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
EMF stands for
electromagnetic field.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all immersed in
electromagnetic fields,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
from Wi-Fi, from the
wiring in our homes,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and it disturbs our
electrical balance.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.198 align:middle line:84%
We get charged
inside of our bodies.

00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:16.365 align:middle line:90%
We get electrically charged.

00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people have as much as
20 volts on their bodies,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and that's not good for you.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But in our natural state,
the Earth has a built-in system

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:90%
to ground our bodies.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Unbeknownst to us, we
live inside a battery.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The surface of the Earth
is charged negatively.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And the ionosphere, which
is a layer of the atmosphere

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
about 60 miles up, which
is ionized by the sun,

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the
rays of the sun are

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
so strong that they split
the molecules in two--

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
a positive charge and
a negative charge.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The sun spews out electrons.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:90%
They come to the Earth.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:90%
They hit the ionosphere.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:90%
They charge the ionosphere.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And periodically, the ionosphere
releases lots of electrons.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.895 align:middle line:90%
It's called lightning.

00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDERCLAP]

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The negative charge are
transferred to the surface

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth through
lightning mainly,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and the positive charge
stay 60 miles up.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The surface of the Earth
is electrically conductive.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you are,
standing barefoot on the Earth

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
or connected to the Earth,
you are collecting electrons

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
that came from the sun.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem arise when we
don't have negative charge.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.525 align:middle line:84%
We need grounding just as we
need air and we need sunshine.

00:19:50.525 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So the TV industry, Clint, he
had to make sure all the cables

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
were very well grounded.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he started to wonder
if people need to be grounded.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I saw with cable
TV was it was bigger than

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Billings, Montana.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The world was bigger
than where I lived.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in Denver,
Colorado, working

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
for Tele-Communications,
Inc. One day,

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I was home with my children.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And I had bought them computers.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We could do checkbooks
and play games.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:84%
That was all we could
do with them back then.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:90%
It just dawned on me.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's a TV
set without a signal.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:10%
So I had this brainstorm,
and I thought, well,

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:10%
let's go get all these wire
services together and put them

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:10%
into a unified data stream,
feed them over the satellite

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:10%
and down the cable system,
feed them into a computer.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.052 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that happened
at that time that was probably

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
very significant for the
cable industry was we

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:90%
created the first cable modem.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.965 align:middle line:84%
It had changed the world
in a day, in a moment.

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I was living in
5,000-square-foot, A-frame,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
log cabin on the top of
a mountain in Evergreen,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Colorado.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I was 49 years old, playing
king of the mountain, and I won.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I had everything
you could imagine--

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
cars, home in Breckenridge,
skiing, most of all,

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of art.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.877 align:middle line:90%
I probably had--

00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it-- but a quarter
million dollars' worth of art

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.662 align:middle line:84%
hanging in my bathroom
over the commode.

00:21:41.662 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Because there was no
place else to hang things.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:84%
About 1994, '95, I was attending
a lot of Christmas parties,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and I got sick.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
One Sunday, I couldn't
get out of bed,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and I was turning yellow.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:90%
My eyes were yellow.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Everything was yellow.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they took me
to an emergency room.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure
out what was wrong,

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.097 align:middle line:90%
but I was losing everything.

00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:90%
My liver was shutting down.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I was only 49 at the time.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you need
to think about getting

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
your house in order,
because you're

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.785 align:middle line:84%
young enough to get a new liver,
but you may not have time.

00:22:26.785 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I was on every IV, every
type of antibiotic you

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
can probably inject
into a person.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
they had a surgeon that

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted to experiment and see
if there was a way they could

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
go in and cut out all the
liver that had been damaged,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
which was the majority of it.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to that because
I really had no option.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I remember, I was in surgery.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was the
last time I would see--

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up a few
days later in ICU.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my secretary
was right here in my face.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
My first thought was, I
didn't know that you had died.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
The pain started
coming on, then I

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:90%
realized that I was still here.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It took about a year for
my energy to recover.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
One morning, I woke up, and
I looked out the window,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that everything
was more energetic.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.247 align:middle line:90%
The sky was vibrant.

00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:40.205 align:middle line:90%
Everything was vibrant.

00:23:40.205 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
leftover from drugs.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But I looked around the
room that I was laying in,

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and I said to
myself that this is

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:84%
all crazy, this house,
everything is crazy,

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:90%
because I almost died.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:10%
All I had ever done was
collect these things,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:10%
and I spent my life
taking care of them.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:10%
I didn't own any of this stuff
because when I die, I go away.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:90%
They really owned me.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:90%
They owned my soul.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I went through this
feeling that I just

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
had to get rid of everything,
push everything away from me,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
anything that was material,
even though I loved it,

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and I spent my life collecting
it and taking care of it.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I had to push it away.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So I called my
children, and I said,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to come and take
whatever there is in this house

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them called
the doc and said,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong with my dad.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.535 align:middle line:90%
He needs to see a psychologist.

00:24:37.535 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing
the psychologist.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with me.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
After disposing, and giving,
and getting rid of everything,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I decided I wanted
to change my life.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I bought an RV, and
I went on a road trip.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.598 align:middle line:10%
And I ended up in
Sedona, Arizona.

00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:10%


00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:10%
One day, I was
sitting at a computer,

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.195 align:middle line:10%
and the computer kept crashing.

00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was
static electricity,

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
so I put a piece of tape
across my desk and grounded it.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized in that
process that the outlet wasn't

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
grounded, so I fixed it
so that I could get rid

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
of the static electricity.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
too much about it.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I walked outdoors,
and I sat on a bench.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:10%
And this tour bus
pulled up, and it

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:10%
looked like they had just been
to one of these outlet malls.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And white Nike
shoes were on sale.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:90%
It just dawned on me.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question,
I said, I wonder

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:84%
if it's possible that humans are
no longer naturally grounded.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.925 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if these shoes
could be interfering with us.

00:25:50.925 --> 00:26:02.367 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So that night, I went
to the hardware store,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and I bought a roll
of metal duct tape.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just taped
it across the bed.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I threw a wire out the window
and had a ground rod outside.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.865 align:middle line:84%
I connected to the
ground on one side

00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and connected to
the metal duct tape

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:90%
that I had laid on the bed.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So when I laid down
on the duct tape,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like grounded because
it was connected to the Earth.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up the
next morning, and I

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
thought, holy cow, there's
something going on here because

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:84%
normally, for me to go to
sleep, I had to take Advil.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to find
out what I could.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
The internet was
hardly anything.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:90%
This is back in '99.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I went down to
University of Arizona,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
into one of their
medical libraries,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I even tried to
find the cause of chronic pain.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:90%
The cause of MS was unknown.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:90%
The cause of arthritis unknown.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
I'll go out to LA.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to UCLA and ask them.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much
laughed me off campus.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They said you expect us
to believe that somebody's

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
going to put a
nail in the ground,

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.485 align:middle line:84%
tie a wire around
somebody's toe,

00:27:14.485 --> 00:27:16.193 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make
them sleep better?

00:27:16.193 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:90%
They said, get out of here.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:90%
You're nuts.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up having to
put together my own study.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I found an anesthesiologist
in San Diego.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I
don't think there's

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:90%
anything to what you're doing.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
This has got to be
an anomaly here.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:90%
But I'll entertain you.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
He says, I will prove
that you're wrong.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And we grounded 60 people.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reports that came
in were unbelievable.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:90%
TMJ disappeared.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:10%
PMS disappeared.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation, reduced pain,
everybody slept better.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:10%
It's the first study that I did
that was a legitimate study,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:10%
where we had quantifiable data.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:84%
When they saw the
study, everybody

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
said, wow, this is really
pretty interesting.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:10%
And we ended up attracting
scientists, physicists.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Like any important discovery,
nobody was interested.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:90%
They thought he was crazy.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are a lot of
scientists who are interested.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.170 align:middle line:10%
Researchers, MDs,
MD-PhDs, PhDs like me.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in
biological questions.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Earthing brings up some really
profound biological questions.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> While these grounding
studies were positive,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
what was groundling actually
doing inside the human body?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:90%
The answer may surprise you.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Stephen Sinatra, who is a
cardiologist from back East,

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:90%
was attending a convention.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down with
Stephen and told him

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:90%
the story of what I was doing.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, if you're
affecting pain, he says,

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:84%
you need to be
researching inflammation.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't have arthritis.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't have cancer.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't have all
these health disorders.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What you have is
chronic inflammation.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
To me at the time, inflammation
was you sprain an ankle,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and it balloons up, and gets
red and sore, and it's inflamed.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
He says, inflammation
is different than that.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We have so much
inflammation in the body,

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and it comes out in illnesses.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We go to a doctor with all these
complaints, but a lot of it

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is silent inflammation,
including my specialty-- heart

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is an
inflammatory process.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So how do we reduce
inflammation?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The most abundant protein
in the body is collagen.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the building
block of our tissues.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have gazillions
of collagen molecules

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:10%
They are all embedded in a gel.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:10%
This gel has a
huge surface area,

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:10%
and it absorbs electrons
and releases them

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:10%
when you have an injury.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Inflammation is
produced by neutrophils,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.620 align:middle line:10%
which is a white blood cell.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
You have an injury, you
have a damaged cell.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And so these white
blood cells come over,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and they encapsulate
the damaged cell,

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and they release reactive oxygen
species, which rip electrons

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
from the damaged cell, and
that destroys the damaged cell.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> White blood cells release
free radicals at the injury

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They chew up any pathogens,
bacteria, or dead cells.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:90%
They clear the area.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:90%
It's called the repair field.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the place that
needs to be repaired.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Without earthing, some
of the free radicals

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that are released
into the repair field

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.420 align:middle line:84%
leak into the
surrounding tissue.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's not enough free
electrons there to reduce

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the remaining radicals, they're
going to steal an electron from

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:84%
a healthy cell, and in
the process, damage it.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the message goes
out to the immune system,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and another neutrophil does
the same thing-- eliminates

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:90%
that cell.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up
with a chain reaction.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And this can create
chronic inflammation,

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:90%
silent inflammation.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
You may not even
know it's there.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.405 align:middle line:90%
And it continues for years.

00:31:26.405 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If inflammation is the cause
of all these health disorders,

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
then I know that not enough
grounding is the cause

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
of inflammation.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.618 align:middle line:84%
Because if the body is grounded,
you can't have inflammation.

00:31:40.618 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The initial grounding
studies showed promise.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was still
a big question.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Was grounding really
achieving these results

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, or
was it something else?

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:90%
A placebo effect of some kind.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I am Senior Research Medical
Scientist at North American

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Science Associates.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:10%
I spent about 10 years working
in the environmental area, five

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:10%
of those at the Environmental
Protection Agency.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:10%
And in 1980, I started
working at the Food and Drug

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:10%
Administration, where I led
a team of biostatisticians,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:10%
and we reviewed clinical
trials for new medical devices.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I would guess that
approximately 10%

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of the medical devices that
FDA sees from inception

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
would end up getting approval
at the end of the day.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So I would review
them very critically.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago,
my 92-year-old mother

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
was suffering from
peripheral artery disease,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and that would require
them to do an intervention.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They would go in and have to
clean out her femoral artery,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:90%
put in a balloon or stent.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They usually have to go in
every six or nine months

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:90%
to clean out the artery.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And I felt at that age, they
couldn't keep doing this.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I tried most everything.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking around, and
I saw this thing on earthing,

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that earthing might be helpful
for peripheral artery disease.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, it's
not going to hurt her.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
will really help her.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So I purchased her
an earthing sheet

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and had her sleep
on it for one night.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
She was also having
trouble hitting a forehand,

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is a lady who
played tennis for 70 years.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And she just couldn't
remember how to hit it.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Next day, she had no trouble.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So I said, there's
definitely something here.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:84%
In all my years in the
medical device field,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen any
responses like this

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.580 align:middle line:90%
for any device or any drug.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:90%
She's now 94.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We play tennis five
or six times a week.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:84%
She leads a fully active
life, cleans her house,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
does pretty much
everything for herself.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
And we attribute
this to the earthing.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's done a great deal.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I was having problems
with my legs.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard for me to walk.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite
certain I would never

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
be able to play tennis
and do other things that I

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And it improved greatly.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I went back
to playing tennis.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Not as good as before,
but pretty good anyway.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It just changed my life.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
worries that I had

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
before that something
bad might happen

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:90%
if I kept trying to do things.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I should just go ahead
and try everything.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the biggest
development I've seen

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.520 align:middle line:84%
in the medical field in my
five decades in public health,

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and my three decades in
the clinical trial field

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and medical devices.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I just have a hard
time believing

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:90%
this is a placebo effect.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You need
electrons for energy.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
electron transport chain

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.390 align:middle line:90%
in mitochondria.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
It generates adenosine
triphosphate, or ATP.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:10%
It's the energy
molecule in the body.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I tell athletes that
before an event,

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
stand 15 minutes in your
bare feet on the grass,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and you will charge up
your electron stores.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And should you fall down--

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:90%
and athletes fall down--

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:84%
you will not have
inflammation at all.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:10%
>> If you think about the
last time you were barefoot

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.060 align:middle line:10%
in nature, it probably
wasn't very recently.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you walk us through it?

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:10%
Let's earth.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.283 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's do it.

00:35:59.283 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Take the shoes off.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:10%
Take the shoes off.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.620 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I first learned about
grounding maybe 12,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.700 align:middle line:10%
13 years ago through one of the
trainers for the Tour de France

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.802 align:middle line:10%
team from the US.

00:36:12.802 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was using it with
many of their athletes

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and with surprising results.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that "surprising"
best summarizes my response

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to it, because it didn't
seem to make sense.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I think I became
a believer once I

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:90%
started to explore the science.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:84%
ATP is short for
adenosine triphosphate.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy
currency of the cell.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.883 align:middle line:90%
We're bioelectrical beings.

00:36:33.883 --> 00:36:35.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the currency
of our bodies.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.133 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:36:36.133 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how we run our biological
systems, is by generating

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
this electrical energy
that's transferred.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we connect to the Earth
through a conductive surface

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:84%
in some way, there's a
transfer of electrons

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:90%
that slowly go into our body.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We tried to figure out how
much charge the body takes

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:90%
in when you touch the Earth.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:10%
What happens is the body
saturates with electrons

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:10%
practically instantaneously.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.550 align:middle line:84%
It's so fast that
you can't measure it.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Electrons from the Earth
enter the body right away,

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and they coat the
red blood cells

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
so that the cells
repel each other,

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and then they can't clump, and
the blood viscosity goes down.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for the
heart to pump the blood.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:90%
The blood pressure goes down.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of cardiovascular
issues, they go away.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> In situations where we are
insulating ourselves from this

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:84%
surplus of electrons
into our body,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
the absolute opposite.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.862 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having low
levels of inflammation

00:37:53.862 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and a thin blood, we'll
have thick blood that's

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.700 align:middle line:84%
more likely to clot, and
our levels of inflammation

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:90%
tend to increase.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm just thinking
on the way here,

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:10%
I was thinking about how maybe
the thinning of the blood is

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.245 align:middle line:10%
the reason that all the
physiological systems go

00:38:13.245 --> 00:38:14.045 align:middle line:10%
into balance.

00:38:14.045 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the grounding
studies, the one that really got

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.390 align:middle line:84%
our attention is called
"Electric Grounding Improves

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.535 align:middle line:90%
Vagal Tone in Preterm Infants."

00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In the study, 26 premature
babies in an NICU

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:84%
were connected to
grounding wires.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The heart rates of the
grounded infants stabilized.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And their vagal tone, a critical
measure of infant health,

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:52.798 align:middle line:90%
increased by 67% with grounding.

00:38:52.798 --> 00:39:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So there are two things.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:84%
There are the electrons
from the Earth,

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's the electrical
rhythms of the Earth.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.685 align:middle line:84%
And that's very important for
setting our biological clocks.

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For thousands of years,
spiritual masters have taught

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
the benefits of meditation
and sitting on the Earth.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why some people believe
that earthing and meditation go

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.140 align:middle line:90%
hand-in-hand.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The world is constantly--
every situation, every event,

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:10%
every relationship--

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:10%
is really a reflection
of yourself.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I would like if--

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.050 align:middle line:90%
you agreed to it earlier--

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you do a guided
meditation with us?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Two minutes?

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So would you all put your
feet firmly on the ground.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Keep your hands in your lap.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we
call the environment

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.260 align:middle line:90%
is actually our body.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
If everything wasn't as
is in the solar system,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:84%
the Earth wouldn't
spin on its own axis,

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and it wouldn't
go around the sun.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:90%
There would be no seasons.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So your biological
rhythms, circadian rhythms,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:84%
are the Earth spinning
on its own axis.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Your seasonal rhythms is the
Earth going around the sun.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're programmed
into your body.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:84%
If you disconnect from
your cosmic body--

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the Earth
is, part of our cosmic body--

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:43.130 align:middle line:84%
you, in a sense,
create the separation

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.655 align:middle line:84%
that results in disruption
of your biological rhythms.

00:40:46.655 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything linked from dis-ease,
discomfort, to inflammation,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.340 align:middle line:90%
starts with this disconnect.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that if
somebody walks barefoot

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:84%
on grass, or the
Earth, or on the beach,

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
at a very fundamental
level, basically,

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
the free radicals that
are built up in your body

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
as a result of stress
and inflammation,

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:90%
they are neutralized.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But what is really happening
at a fundamental level

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is you're restoring
your biological rhythms

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them in alignment,
or you might say synchrony,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.790 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth, which is
connected to the entire cosmos.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And slowly open your eyes.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That was so cool.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I am so grateful for you.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The analogy would
be a good orchestra.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:84%
If they're all playing by
themselves, what you hear

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:90%
is noise.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a
conductor, there's

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a coherence,
entanglement

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.095 align:middle line:84%
of these frequencies,
you hear music.

00:42:09.095 --> 00:42:11.075 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:11.075 --> 00:42:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's a cosmic symphony
that is playing itself out

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:90%
in your body right this moment.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't hear
the tune, but you're

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:90%
dancing to it anyway.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take a microscope,
and you look at a piece of wood,

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.503 align:middle line:84%
and you go down, down,
down, all of a sudden,

00:42:32.503 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:10%
There's molecules, but
they're not even connected.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:90%
What's holding them together?

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.970 align:middle line:84%
What's the force that's
holding everything together?

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Electromagnetism.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Our body is electrical.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
This is all
electronic equipment.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.660 align:middle line:84%
The heart, the
lungs, the brain--

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:90%
this is electrical equipment.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all electrical.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.982 align:middle line:90%
Everything is electrical.

00:42:57.982 --> 00:43:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we measure the
effects reproducibly?

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:90%
The answer to that is yes.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.240 align:middle line:90%
We now have 20 studies.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There's like, yeah,
20, 21 published studies

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
in the medical literature
on earthing and grounding.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is peer review stuff.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.090 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms,
what earthing does

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:84%
is literally it squenches
the fires of inflammation.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And if inflammation is the
source of all root illnesses,

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.390 align:middle line:84%
including Alzheimer's disease,
cancer, heart disease,

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:90%
diabetes--

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.770 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:40.940 align:middle line:84%
If you can impact inflammation,
and squelch it, kill it,

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:84%
stop it, we're going
to be healthier babies.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know
anything about grounding.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard of it at all.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:10%
But I became a new mom,
and I had my first child,

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:10%
and she had colic, and she
cried, and cried, and cried.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.285 align:middle line:84%
First thing I did, being
a physician myself,

00:44:02.285 --> 00:44:03.660 align:middle line:84%
was take her to
the pediatrician.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.617 align:middle line:84%
And remember distinctly leaving
that pediatrician's office

00:44:06.617 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:84%
with a knot in my stomach,
because the first thing

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.250 align:middle line:84%
they told me is, it's
a baby, let them cry.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the
only time I noticed

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't in pain, and the
only time I could soothe her,

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.330 align:middle line:84%
was when I was outside,
and I was barefoot,

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and I had her in my arms.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And every time we were
outside, she relaxed.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I noticed if I did
use a stroller,

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or if she was in a
car, she was still

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.310 align:middle line:90%
in pain and uncomfortable.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:90%
This is not placebo effect.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.323 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea if I was
wearing shoes or not.

00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know that.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding her either way.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And I just slowly
started realizing,

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:10%
this child can only take
a nap and feel comfort

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:10%
if she was on my skin,
held skin-to-skin,

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:10%
and I was barefoot.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.440 align:middle line:84%
She'd be dead asleep, and
if I stepped in the house

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and took both my feet off the
ground, she would wake back up,

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.368 align:middle line:84%
and the pain response
would come back.

00:44:55.368 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what it was called,

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't at that time
feel comfortable thinking

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.410 align:middle line:84%
about using it in my
conventional medical practice.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew that
this is what I'm

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:90%
going to do to help my child.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
a mentor of mine,

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and she recommended
that I ground my energy.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what she
meant by ground yourself,

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:84%
so the first thing
I did was go home

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.182 align:middle line:90%
and look it up on the internet.

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And through doing a
search about grounding,

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I found Clint Ober's work,
and the book about earthing.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that it's a
real thing and a real healing

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.560 align:middle line:84%
modality with tons of
medical literature behind it.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:90%
The light switch went on.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we're doing
things completely backwards

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.760 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.330 align:middle line:84%
A typical day for a child
is completely ungrounded.

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Most children wake up, sleeping
on a bed that was not grounded,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in a house, or a building,
or on a floor that

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:90%
was insulated from the Earth.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
immediately into a classroom

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.140 align:middle line:90%
that's insulated.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.580 align:middle line:10%
And even on recess,
in the recess period,

00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:10%
they go outside and are
literally fenced in,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.335 align:middle line:10%
and they're paved
with asphalt. And then

00:46:02.335 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:10%
they have after school
activities, which are either

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:10%
indoors, or if
they're outdoors, they

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:10%
are literally required
to wear protective gear.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And even if they're exercising
for two hours after school,

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.020 align:middle line:84%
100% disconnected
from the Earth.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they go home, and they
go inside, and they eat dinner,

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and they do homework
all hours of the night.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they pass out
in a ungrounded bed.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's a 24-hour period of
time completely ungrounded.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And that goes on day
after day after day.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:35.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I was at a retreat
weekend for a group of women.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.530 align:middle line:10%
It's called Inspire through
our National Association.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.610 align:middle line:10%
It's for teachers who don't
take care of themselves.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Teaching us how to.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.693 align:middle line:84%
The first day I got there,
and our leader said,

00:46:50.693 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:90%
you need to go ground.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, O-- OK.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.580 align:middle line:90%
They grounded us.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And within that half hour, there
was no need for medication.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had been taking two
Motrin every four hours

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.590 align:middle line:90%
for almost three weeks.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The district that
I am in already

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.080 align:middle line:84%
actually has, with
Clint, a school

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.170 align:middle line:90%
that has a grounding classroom.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that
the other teacher pushed

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:84%
so hard to get
this room, she had

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.630 align:middle line:84%
a group of students that had
significant behavior issues.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would rip
their shoes off

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.422 align:middle line:90%
and go running out of the room.

00:47:28.422 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they went all over
campus looking for them.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.130 align:middle line:84%
They would always find them
in the planters by the trees.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But I had one teacher tell me
in a special ed class that they

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:90%
had runners.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:10%
And what a runner is is
a kid who just runs out

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:10%
of the classroom,
and they take off,

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:10%
and everybody has to go
find where the student is.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.960 align:middle line:10%
I realized that these
kids who are the runners,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:10%
they're running out to the
far back corner of the school

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:10%
campus.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
place that has grass.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.852 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting
down on the grass.

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I went back, and I
talked to my special education

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:12.150 align:middle line:90%
director.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, can we try this?

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Can we try this with some
of our students with autism?

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I brought it into my room.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I have a student with
autism, very severe autism.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:90%
He's completely nonverbal.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good day when
I can get this child

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:90%
to sit for 10 seconds.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I pulled my mat out.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I cleaned it off.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I took his socks and shoes
off, put his little feet on it.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.400 align:middle line:84%
That boy sat for seven minutes
straight and played with me.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:84%
He sat for seven
minutes straight.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:90%
So I took that back to my boss.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.615 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
our school district is looking

00:48:45.615 --> 00:48:48.783 align:middle line:84%
into, is getting more
schools with classrooms

00:48:48.783 --> 00:48:49.950 align:middle line:90%
that have grounding in them.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I have heard stories from
teachers in classes where

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.070 align:middle line:84%
their students are grounded
that they have half the level

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.020 align:middle line:90%
of referrals for discipline.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Some students who were
in tears because they

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.030 align:middle line:10%
were experiencing
success when before, they

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:10%
were experiencing failure with
their behavior and discipline.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I've heard stories from
teachers with autistic children

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.880 align:middle line:84%
who have been grounded,
where they have less of what

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.470 align:middle line:90%
they call the meltdowns.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And the meltdowns are
less frequent and shorter,

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and they come back
into the classroom,

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're learning
more than they had

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.170 align:middle line:90%
learned prior to the grounding.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> How much of it is that
they're just so out of control

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in their mind, and there's
so many things that they--

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and these kids-- our
campus is concrete.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.052 align:middle line:90%
There's no place.

00:49:39.052 --> 00:49:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Even when they're in PE,
they've got tennis shoes on.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no place for
them to be grounded.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.335 align:middle line:84%
>> It's amazing what happens
not just with the teacher

00:49:51.335 --> 00:49:53.460 align:middle line:84%
at the front of the class,
but what can happen with

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:84%
the student sitting
in the class.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And just think if
every single student

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and every single teacher
in every single classroom

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and every single school across
this whole world was grounded.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out there's a reason
kids love to put their feet

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.710 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And these guys
claim to know why.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, my name is Finian.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Lauren.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And my name is Ryland.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're Kiss the Ground.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:24.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And our mission is to
inspire participation in global

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.580 align:middle line:10%
regeneration,
starting with soil.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We evolved very
connected to the soil,

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.550 align:middle line:84%
with our feet in the soil,
our hands in the soil.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And what this means, when
you're connecting with it,

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:10%
is just starting
to be discovered.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.380 align:middle line:10%
There are papers and
things in science

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.750 align:middle line:10%
that are just very recent,
coming out, telling us

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:48.100 align:middle line:10%
that actually, touching
soil is helping to make

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:10%
your immune system stronger.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.795 align:middle line:84%
When you're working in that
regenerative relationship

00:50:53.795 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:90%
with nature, it feels different.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.430 align:middle line:90%
It changes lives.

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:10%
>> And one of the biggest
sources of suffering in life is

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.100 align:middle line:10%
the experience of
being disconnected.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:10%
And disconnected from what?

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Nature.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And the basis of
nature is our soil.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The coolest thing
about connecting to soil

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.830 align:middle line:10%
and the planet is it
really makes you happy.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we have science
that shows that it's

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.218 align:middle line:90%
a cure for depression.

00:51:20.218 --> 00:51:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.623 align:middle line:84%
>> So which one of you was the
first one to discover earthing?

00:51:32.623 --> 00:51:34.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to
say it was Mariel.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.050 align:middle line:10%
She was born before me.

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:37.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, wow.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.400 align:middle line:84%
She got 18 months of
bare feet on the ground

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.942 align:middle line:84%
before I even hit
the ground running.

00:51:41.942 --> 00:51:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That might be an insult.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we actually went to
the track when we first got

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.270 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.853 align:middle line:84%
We went over to
Pepperdine University.

00:51:48.853 --> 00:51:50.760 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't run since--

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.560 align:middle line:90%
well--

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> A long time.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.905 align:middle line:90%
And she's, I do yoga.

00:51:53.905 --> 00:51:55.947 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, we
need to go to the track.

00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:58.333 align:middle line:84%
We went to the track, and
we ran barefoot in the grass

00:51:58.333 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of hours.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.080 align:middle line:90%
She loved it.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.577 align:middle line:90%
That was for fun.

00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That was for fun.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we didn't
talk about grounding.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.157 align:middle line:84%
It was just something
that you do.

00:52:05.157 --> 00:52:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So we get up.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:90%
We watch sunrises.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we usually
go out for a hike.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.302 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time, he
stopped, and he took his shoes.

00:52:16.302 --> 00:52:17.260 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say anything.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.730 align:middle line:90%
He took his shoes off.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, what are you doing?

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.795 align:middle line:84%
And he just started walking
and didn't do anything.

00:52:22.795 --> 00:52:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And he also closed his eyes.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.450 align:middle line:90%
That was a whole other terror.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I came from a very
dysfunctional home.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I loved my family
tremendously, but there

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:37.358 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of mental illness.

00:52:37.358 --> 00:52:39.400 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, being one
of the greatest writers

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century, he suffered
tremendous mental health

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.500 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:52.350 align:middle line:84%
He also took his life in 1961,
three months before I was born.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:10%
I lost a great grandfather,
two great grandfathers,

00:52:55.830 --> 00:53:00.030 align:middle line:10%
another great uncle, an uncle,
a cousin, and my own sister

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:03.480 align:middle line:10%
took her life.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.880 align:middle line:84%
This house was filled
with people that

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.360 align:middle line:90%
were tremendously tortured.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.333 align:middle line:90%
A lot of yelling.

00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of drinking.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.958 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
self-medication.

00:53:12.958 --> 00:53:16.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of craziness
that was happening.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.580 align:middle line:10%
To sort of survive was, for
me, getting out in nature,

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:10%
just any time I
could be outside.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd find myself lying on
the grass, or lying in a field,

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:32.930 align:middle line:84%
or lying in a meadow, that
would make me feel better.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't
until I met Bobby

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that what I was
instinctually doing actually

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:46.730 align:middle line:84%
was a very real way to address
all kinds of inflammation.

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation isn't
just physical.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:50.540 align:middle line:90%
There is neuro-inflammation.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.860 align:middle line:90%
That's brain inflammation.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Brain inflammation
causes depression,

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
causes all kinds of
serious problems.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a much bigger thing
than just walking barefoot

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.950 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:84%
This is helping--
well, especially me--

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.710 align:middle line:84%
helping me have a way
more balanced life.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.140 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, you think
of great artists, some

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.180 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest
writing that they do

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.110 align:middle line:84%
comes from when they were at
some beautiful and specific

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.240 align:middle line:84%
place, and their
description of it.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.860 align:middle line:84%
That comes from
an understanding,

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.360 align:middle line:90%
from a connection to it.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:84%
To know that there
are solutions,

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and they're solutions in nature.

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest solutions
is that connection to nature.

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And people forget that first.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's sad because it
is so accessible,

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and it is so real to
know that a grounded me,

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Mariel, or a grounded
you, or anybody else,

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is different than the
one who's not connected.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's what grounding does.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It pulls you into
you, to who you are.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
always the same thing.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that your mom
said when you were a kid.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Go outside and play.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Go outside and get
some fresh air.

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:16.500 align:middle line:84%
By the way, a lot of
grounding from this guy.

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.280 align:middle line:90%
19 years old.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.208 align:middle line:90%
Look at the feet.

00:55:19.208 --> 00:55:20.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.792 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one grounded
dog right there.

00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:32.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I first heard about
grounding, I want to say,

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.140 align:middle line:90%
about seven years ago.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It immediately
changed my mindset

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:43.470 align:middle line:90%
to appreciating the ground.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.520 align:middle line:10%
And then the history that we
used to all be on the ground,

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.820 align:middle line:10%
and sleep on the ground,
and wear shoes that

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.830 align:middle line:10%
were connected to
the ground, not

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:55.710 align:middle line:10%
plasticised and disconnecting.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, this
makes actually so much sense.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:84%
How have I not been able to
put that together before?

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved nature.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in nature.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of actually
putting my feet on the ground

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:13.600 align:middle line:84%
without shoes, it
felt always good,

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.490 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
connect that it actually

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:90%
could be good for my body.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I know we're
all electrical beings,

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.570 align:middle line:84%
so we're constantly being
bombarded with everything

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.360 align:middle line:90%
artificial and overstimulating.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I feel really
sensitive to that.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:35.980 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working long hours,
and have this electrical mic

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.980 align:middle line:84%
strapped on, acting,
and just being

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:44.710 align:middle line:84%
around everything so electrical,
it starts to just exhaust me.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all get
so overstimulated by all

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.300 align:middle line:90%
the electrification around us.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
doing us any good.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Big girl.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Our bodies are constantly
being bombarded by everything

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.050 align:middle line:90%
electrical in our lives.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've learned that
in order to recalibrate my body,

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I just need to put my feet
on the ground barefoot.

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And it just sort of equalizes.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that when you
get intentional with putting

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:23.650 align:middle line:84%
your feet on the ground, you
immediately steel yourself,

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to just,
again, reconnect back

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to nature, to the
simplicity of Mother Earth,

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of this great, huge planet.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you're appreciating
what's under your feet.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole
symbiotic relationship

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that we've disconnected
from in such big ways.

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.690 align:middle line:84%
That just the simple act of
putting your feet on the ground

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:50.222 align:middle line:84%
can give you so much, and so
much balance in your body,

00:57:50.222 --> 00:57:51.055 align:middle line:90%
and so much healing.

00:57:51.055 --> 00:57:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're sucking the
life energy through our feet

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:02.940 align:middle line:90%
up our bodies, from our mama.

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It's so bad.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.721 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- that's
really embarrassing.

00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because it's so
easy, and it's so simple.

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.150 align:middle line:90%
People are like, really?

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:17.525 align:middle line:84%
You're making a
big deal of that?

00:58:17.525 --> 00:58:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Intuitively, it 100% resonates.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm raising my
daughter this way,

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:31.940 align:middle line:84%
where I want her to be barefoot
outside as much as she can.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.320 align:middle line:90%
My husband likes being barefoot.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.120 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to convince
him to take his shoes off.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Animals always barefoot.

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:42.200 align:middle line:10%
And I know just bringing them
outside makes them happy.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.025 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to keep doing that,

00:58:44.025 --> 00:58:45.900 align:middle line:84%
whether people want to
make fun of me or not.

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.790 align:middle line:90%


00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you believe in,
when you're out in nature,

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it feels bigger than
you, and it feels

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:57.450 align:middle line:84%
like you have reverence
for what we have here.

00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:10.590 align:middle line:90%


00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:15.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I've always been climbing
mountains, running rivers,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.480 align:middle line:10%
always had a garden
wherever I live.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Lived in Hawaii and Alaska,
where I did naked gardening.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.173 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:59:25.173 --> 00:59:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But once you're in a wheelchair,
all of that goes away.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm 58.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I was a singer, dancer,
actress for most of my career.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But then at age 36, I
woke up paralyzed one day

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:51.790 align:middle line:84%
from this rare disease
called transverse myelitis.

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It affects maybe 1 in
about 2 million people.

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it first
happened to me,

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.790 align:middle line:90%
they didn't know what it was.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they've come to realize

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.450 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with inflammation,
and it's an immune dysfunction.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Your body attacking itself.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.410 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.760 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
the doctors say,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.320 align:middle line:84%
well, we don't understand
it, and we don't really

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
know how to treat it, so
we'll just treat symptoms.

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And for 21 years,
that's been my story.

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:36.780 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
My niece actually sent
me a grounding kit

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
about three years ago.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
She knew that I
couldn't physically

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.188 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the Earth anymore,
and she heard about this,

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and she thought it'd be
the perfect thing for me.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.590 align:middle line:90%


01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So I received it.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And my first impression was,
OK, this makes no sense to me

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.930 align:middle line:90%
at all.

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to hurt
my niece's feelings,

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
so I put it on
the end of the bed

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and plugged it into the
socket as per my instructions.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:17.597 align:middle line:84%
And the first night, I
couldn't feel anything.

01:01:17.597 --> 01:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem to
make any difference.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But when I woke up in the
morning, my feet, which

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:26.625 align:middle line:84%
are always swollen,
first time I tried it,

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
there was no
swelling in my feet.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
bones in my feet,

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and that hadn't happened
probably in six months.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I just made it part of my life.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
After a couple years, it
suddenly occurred to me, gee,

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
everybody I know who's
in a wheelchair has

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
inflammation and swelling
issues along with pain.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So I called Marty and
said, let me tell you

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
about the Abilities Expo.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Would you guys consider
expanding your audience?

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Clint thought it was a great
idea, and now they're here.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:11.750 align:middle line:90%


01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Natural phenomena, a
remarkable natural phenomena

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that exists right
beneath our feet.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Earthing or grounding
is about connecting

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.160 align:middle line:90%
to this natural resource.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of
your condition,

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
it can make you feel better.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's the background.

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Throughout time,
throughout history, humans

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.710 align:middle line:90%
were connected to the Earth.

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
We walked barefoot.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We slept on natural
animal hides.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.280 align:middle line:90%
We were connected to the Earth.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But today, it's a
different story.

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:52.180 align:middle line:90%
We sleep in elevated beds.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
We wear synthetic soled shoes.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And even our wheelchairs
are insulating us.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.720 align:middle line:10%
When we make direct contact
with the surface of the Earth,

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.940 align:middle line:10%
our bodies receive--

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.120 align:middle line:10%
10 years ago, I was working
with a holistic cardiologist,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.060 align:middle line:10%
and we wanted to do an
article on grounding.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And so he said to me, the
cardiologist, he said,

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:17.620 align:middle line:10%
you've got to call Clint Ober.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I went, and
I called Clint Ober.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I spoke to him for five minutes.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I realized this is not
an article, this is a book.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:27.880 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge discovery.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first heard about it,
I took it with a pinch of salt.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It sounded a little
too good to be true.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Having now experienced
several friends and people

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
in our team who
have used grounding,

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
the skepticism's
pretty much gone.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Right behind us right
now is one of my friends.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Her mom is in a companion chair.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes ago, she
was swollen legs.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Feet were cold.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Hands were cold.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.360 align:middle line:90%
And now they're not.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is her first
experience with grounding.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.442 align:middle line:10%
That's 15 minutes of
real life demonstration.

01:03:58.442 --> 01:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'm pretty much a convert.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:02.190 align:middle line:90%


01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:08.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I am 39 years old, trying
to take pride in that.

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
MS 14 years ago.

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.310 align:middle line:90%


01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The first time I heard about
grounding, I thought, get real.

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:21.550 align:middle line:90%
This seems crazy.

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
My friend patched me
up, and I sat there.

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And we all just talked
for about 45 minutes.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I found myself smiling, and that
wasn't something that I did.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I physically have more energy.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the fatigue.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I really
can accomplish things.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I can brush my teeth now without
holding onto the counter.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.050 align:middle line:90%
My balance is better.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I just feel-- it sounds silly,
but I feel more grounded.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:06.805 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my feet are really
hanging onto the ground,

01:05:06.805 --> 01:05:07.605 align:middle line:90%
and I'm there.

01:05:07.605 --> 01:05:10.820 align:middle line:90%


01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.990 align:middle line:10%
I do it every night.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:16.040 align:middle line:10%
I sleep on a pad, and
I patch up my hands,

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.770 align:middle line:10%
and sleep with a
grounding blanket.

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just really am obsessive
because I'm noticing,

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I just finally look
forward to tomorrow.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.360 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.743 align:middle line:10%
>> For the most part,
it's been sleep.

01:05:31.743 --> 01:05:33.410 align:middle line:10%
She's been able to
get through the night

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.990 align:middle line:10%
without having to
get up six times

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:39.200 align:middle line:10%
to go to the bathroom
or anything like that.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Her spasticity has
gotten a ton better.

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
She used to have
restless legs all night,

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't
really happen anymore.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It's been huge.

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:48.408 align:middle line:84%
It's been a big
difference for her.

01:05:48.408 --> 01:05:51.090 align:middle line:90%


01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I want everybody to try this.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anybody
to not experience this.

01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who has pain, anybody
who can't sleep that well,

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.570 align:middle line:90%
anybody who gets depressed.

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
that have been completely

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
lifted out of my life.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.010 align:middle line:90%


01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to feel like a burden,
a real burden, to my husband,

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.350 align:middle line:90%
to my family.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel like
a burden anymore.

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- I feel good,
and I feel like things

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
are going to get better.

01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:29.170 align:middle line:90%


01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It's my miracle.

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:39.630 align:middle line:90%


01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Rawr.

01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
As Athena began to
ground more and more,

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we noticed a dramatic
shift in her health.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Athena, do you know
what grounding is?

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.410 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's when you put your feet
or your whole body on Mama

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Earth, and she heals you.

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.696 align:middle line:90%
How does she heal you?

01:07:05.696 --> 01:07:08.531 align:middle line:90%
>> With her healing magic.

01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> With her magic.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:10.885 align:middle line:90%
And have you been grounding?

01:07:10.885 --> 01:07:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
as a result of that?

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't have to go to
the hospital in a whole year.

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You haven't been to the
hospital in a whole year.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We're so happy about
that, aren't we?

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't like the
hospital very much, do you?

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.590 align:middle line:90%


01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.100 align:middle line:10%
When we began grounding Athena,
a very progressive doctor

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.290 align:middle line:10%
had suggested I also try it.

01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He told me to lie
naked on the ground.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.730 align:middle line:90%


01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:45.930 align:middle line:10%
It sounded ridiculous.

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:48.570 align:middle line:90%
But I did it anyway.

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And then everything changed.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.810 align:middle line:90%


01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I began to sleep
through the night.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.440 align:middle line:10%
My energy level shifted.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:04.240 align:middle line:10%
And I got my libido back.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Over the next six months, I
kept practicing grounding,

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and I lost 50 pounds.

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't expecting any of this.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Clint.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.934 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying
to heal my daughter.

01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Rebecca.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:21.870 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
coming to visit us.

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No problem.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.585 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful drive today.

01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:27.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:27.385 --> 01:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, look at you.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.210 align:middle line:90%
This is insane.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:31.832 align:middle line:90%
How did you do this?

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There is this incredible
thing I need to tell you about.

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.873 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard about it,

01:08:35.873 --> 01:08:37.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's called grounding.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on in.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:40.845 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you here.

01:08:40.845 --> 01:08:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to be here.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Got to get those shoes off.

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I'm extremely
excited to share with you

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is that our daughter has
not been to the emergency

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:53.609 align:middle line:90%
room in many months now.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
many nights at 2:00 AM,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
we wound up in
the emergency room

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:58.920 align:middle line:90%
because she couldn't breathe.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, she's
like any other kid.

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:02.430 align:middle line:90%
She has a cold.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.450 align:middle line:90%
She has a normal cold.

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.340 align:middle line:90%
She sleeps through the night.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
What can you attribute that to?

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, when children are
sick, and they get run down,

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:14.609 align:middle line:10%
they don't get good sleep,
and they have inflammation

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.600 align:middle line:10%
in their body.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.020 align:middle line:84%
She started grounding, and
she started sleeping better.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The grounding is reducing
the inflammation.

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
She's working with a
significantly improved

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:25.290 align:middle line:90%
immune system.

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.609 align:middle line:90%
It's called immunotherapy.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Get grounded and improve
your immune system.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So the surprise side effect
of grounding our daughter was I

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.550 align:middle line:90%
got grounded.

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:36.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:40.229 align:middle line:10%
>> And as you can see, I've
had a complete transformation.

01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:41.770 align:middle line:10%
Can you explain
what happened to me?

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:43.109 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:48.670 align:middle line:10%
As soon as you get grounded,
the first thing that happens,

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.630 align:middle line:10%
you quiet the sympathetic
nervous system.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, the
adrenals will start to recover.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But when your adrenals
becomes exhausted

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because of too much
stimulation here, then

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic
overdrives, and then you

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:05.890 align:middle line:90%
end up with adrenal fatigue.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is the precursor
to most all of these things,

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.447 align:middle line:90%
including weight gain.

01:10:10.447 --> 01:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I never would have believed
that you and I would be sitting

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
here, having this conversation,
not in a million years.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Have other women reported weight
loss as a result of grounding?

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:21.707 --> 01:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Not to the point
that I could come out

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, get grounded,
you're going to lose weight.

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It starts up here.

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It starts getting the
pain out of your body,

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
getting the stress, the
anxiety, the irritability,

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:35.300 align:middle line:90%
the depression, out of the body.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
the right hormones

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.860 align:middle line:90%
start to surface.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Your energy comes up.

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.667 align:middle line:90%
Metabolism comes up.

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Health is not something
we really have to work on.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:44.852 align:middle line:90%
We have to let it be.

01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:46.810 align:middle line:10%
We have to take the things
that are interfering

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.930 align:middle line:10%
with our health, that are
compromising our immune system,

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:52.270 align:middle line:10%
and remove them from our
life, and then the body

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:53.230 align:middle line:10%
will go back to normal.

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:58.050 align:middle line:90%


01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So why hasn't it
caught on in mainstream?

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I can only say it will.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a well-established,
traditional, conventional

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
system that relies on
expensive intervention.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So they'd like to
perpetuate that.

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're not too
interested in having

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
some competition
coming in for a lot

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
less expensive to sabotage
their profit levels.

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Because their goal
isn't to help humanity.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Their goal, really,
as corporations,

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
is increase their profits.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
The question becomes,
how much of an influence

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
has lack of grounding been
in the epidemic of disease

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
that we have?

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Is this grounding a factor?

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a pain epidemic,
which has led to an opiate

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:45.850 align:middle line:90%
epidemic.

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a national crisis.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So given the worldwide
discomfort, unhealth, diseases,

01:11:55.030 --> 01:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
all of them are
benefited by earthing.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a resistance to
integrating novel thoughts.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And many times, new
ideas aren't implemented

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
until the people who hold
the counter opinion die.

01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There are lots of people
who don't want this to happen.

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why people
critique it to death.

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they do that.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
What the skeptics need
to do is try it out.

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:27.180 align:middle line:90%


01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The good thing about
grounding is that you

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
don't need a doctor
to tell you to do it.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
You do not need a physician
to recommend it to you.

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.340 align:middle line:90%
You can try this any time.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It is your birthright because
you live on the Earth.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I ground every day.

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I want to be connected
to the Earth as much as I can.

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:51.420 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say about 95%
of the day, I'm grounded,

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:56.660 align:middle line:10%
because I believe it's
just a no-brainer.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Go outdoors,
take your shoes off,

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:01.040 align:middle line:84%
stand barefoot on the
Earth, or sit on the Earth,

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
put your feet and your
hands on the Earth,

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and you will instantly notice
the pain and inflammation begin

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
to drain from your body.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
"I got my life back" is
probably the most common refrain

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.040 align:middle line:90%
that I hear.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
I got my life back.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
I got my life back.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:26.350 align:middle line:90%


01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if the science isn't
yet considered mainstream,

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
there is an undeniable and
growing number of people who

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.948 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing the
benefits of grounding.

01:13:35.948 --> 01:13:38.820 align:middle line:90%


01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
As for us and our family, we're
spending more time outside

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and spending more time together.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we're keeping our feet
firmly planted on the ground.

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Does our daughter
still get sick?

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but not nearly as much.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Maybe she's growing out
of it, or maybe she's

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.400 align:middle line:10%
just growing up grounded.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%


01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.550 align:middle line:90%
