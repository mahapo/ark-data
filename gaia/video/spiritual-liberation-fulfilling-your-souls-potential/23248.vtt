>>It has been said that there
are three kinds of awakening.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:84%
There's the waking up that
occurs when an individual wakes

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:90%
up from a long night's sleep.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
There is the awakening that
occurs when an individual makes

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
their transition and discovers
that there is no death.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
the most important

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
waking up-- the
waking up that occurs

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
when an individual realizes
they have never been born

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and they will never die.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
That they are an
eternal, immortal being.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
My awakening came in the
form of a reoccurring dream.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a lucid dream.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.912 align:middle line:84%
Night after night, I was
being chased by three men.

00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.804 align:middle line:84%
Each night, these men became
closer and closer to me.

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Until finally, they caught me.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Two of them held me
down as the third man

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
towered over me
with a long knife.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
He suddenly lunged
in my direction

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and plunged his
blade into my heart.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.773 align:middle line:90%
I screamed out.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And I died.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
When I awoke, everything
was different.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I had changed.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The fear, the anxiety, the
worry had disintegrated.

>>From that moment on,
there was an enthusiasm.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.616 align:middle line:84%
An enthusiasm for discovering
what had happened to me.

00:02:56.616 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
A feeling tone of discovery and
exploration, into exactly who

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and what was I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
This awakening had
tried to happen

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
at other times in my life,
but I had outwitted it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and prevented it from occurring.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But with this death,
there was no going back,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.798 align:middle line:84%
and my life now was about
discovering and expressing

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:44.234 align:middle line:84%
the vitalizing, loving
presence that we all are.

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It allowed me to
discover, ultimately,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.115 align:middle line:90%
what meditation was and is.

00:03:50.115 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
An undistractable attention to
that which is real, that which

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
is forever, that which is alive.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
We discover, ultimately,
that we're not

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to fit meditation
into our busy life,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
with our to do list,
with all the things

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:90%
that need to be done.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%

we make a discovery

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.395 align:middle line:84%
that our life begins to
revolve around our meditation.

listening to our choir sing it,

they've taken out the insects,
they've taken out the birds

no activation of sunlight

in the food anymore.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
actually bless the food

to activate that sunlight
that's in the food.

00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Activate the vibration.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.436 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>I love that.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.026 align:middle line:84%
>>You're not just
thanking God for food.

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You're actually making
the food vibrational

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.689 align:middle line:84%
friendly with your body when
you hold it and bless it.

00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>And so when you feed
your dogs, Shiba and Biko,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.313 align:middle line:90%
do you bless--

00:10:21.313 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>I bless the dogs, yes.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>You do?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>I do.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.451 align:middle line:90%
>>I do too.

00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:26.324 align:middle line:84%
>>I give them very
special food, because they

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:27.807 align:middle line:90%
get my leftovers of my shake.

00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>What is in that green shake
that you make every morning?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.913 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know if I
can tell you that.

00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The first time I ever went
to Agape, I was by myself,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was a little
overwhelming for me.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.609 align:middle line:84%
And then you had all the
new members stand up.

00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>If it's your first time
at Agape, please stand.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
All first timers.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So many new people here today.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.314 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.314 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
The congregation of
Agape contemplates

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love, and they
allow it to move consciously

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
through their mind and
their soul, their heart,

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:90%
and their hands.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And we say this to you.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.178 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Agape.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome to Agape.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>We recognize you.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>We recognize you.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>We know who you really are.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>We know who you really are.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.485 align:middle line:84%
>>You are the spiritual image
and the very likeness of God.

00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>You are the spiritual image
and the very likeness of God.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>You are a unique way in
which love, intelligence,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and divine beauty are
happening on this planet.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.305 align:middle line:84%
>>You are a unique way in
which love, intelligence,

00:11:41.305 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and divine beauty are
happening on this planet.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.345 align:middle line:84%
>>Today, we get to
celebrate your life.

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Today, we get to
celebrate your life.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We appreciate you.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>We appreciate you.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.835 align:middle line:90%
>>And we thank God for you.

00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:55.346 align:middle line:90%
>>And we thank God for you.

00:11:55.346 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome to Agape!

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.642 align:middle line:90%
>>[CHEERING]

00:11:59.642 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>They start crying, because
they've never been totally

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:90%
accepted, and totally--

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Unconditional love.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Unconditional love.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And totally recognized.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Ooh.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Especially the part-- we
see you, we recognize you.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something about
that that just-- I mean,

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.269 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
gonna cry right now.

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>We have people sometimes
that have been there before,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
but they stand up to
get a double dose.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.254 align:middle line:84%
I know they've
been there before,

00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and they'll stand up just
to feel the presence off--

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I can remember
over 22 years ago,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
as I was giving
up the resistance

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
to being an instrument through
which this community could

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:90%
be born.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I can remember not
wanting to do that.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:90%
I thought I liked my life.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.766 align:middle line:90%
I was counseling.

00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I was doing seminars.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.275 align:middle line:90%
I had my weekends free.

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.052 align:middle line:90%
Private life.

00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It was cool.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But something within
was saying, there's

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
more in you that
wants to come forward.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
There's something
within you that you

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:90%
need to take another step.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:90%
You need to take a leap.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:90%
You need to move.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And as I was trying
to navigate myself

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
around staying where I was
and pretending to grow,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I can remember this crook
that I had in my neck

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.053 align:middle line:84%
that I was constantly
going to a chiropractor

00:13:15.053 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to have it adjusted
because I didn't have

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
full mobility
turning to the right.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.599 align:middle line:90%
And it would always be adjusted.

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
The chiropractor
would do a good job,

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.467 align:middle line:84%
and then a couple weeks later,
it would be there again.

00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the one day, I was
sitting in my office,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and I gave my whole
soul, unattached, yes.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:90%
No bargaining with the presence.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm ready.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm able.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm willing to
take the next step.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, my
neck cracked into place.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.005 align:middle line:90%
And I had full mobility.

00:13:46.005 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
That moment when I liberated
that energy and said yes,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
it saved me.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It set me free.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It allowed the mobility and
the flexibility to be there.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>And you also said that
you had this neck problem,

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and you went to
the chiropractor,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't get fixed.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And you said it was
your unwillingness

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:90%
to take the next step.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that all disease
and illness and injury

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
is an unwillingness
to take the next step?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.695 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't want to
use the word all,

00:14:12.695 --> 00:14:15.705 align:middle line:84%
but I do want to say something
that the body temple is

00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:84%
a perfect feedback loop as to
what's happening in your mind

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:90%
and in your soul.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Unconscious thought
patterns, incorrect beliefs,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
things that you're holding
onto, stagnant thoughts.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They will show up
in the body temple.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They will show up
in the mental body.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They will show up in
the emotional body.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.784 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to have a perfect
feedback loop in the body

00:14:33.784 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
temple, and so therefore,
disease and disharmony

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely giving you
a message that there's

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.956 align:middle line:84%
something that needs to
be shifted and changed.

00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>In addition to food,
clothing, and shelter,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
love is a basic human
need, too, right?

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Love is what we are made from.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We are the spiritual
image and likeness

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of the love which is the total
givingness of the presence

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.194 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
striving to do-- to wake up

00:14:57.194 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to the loving essence of
who and what we really are.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>I have one final
question for you.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the big money question.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-oh.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>What did the Zen Buddhist
say to the hot dog vendor?

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>For the money?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.684 align:middle line:84%
Final answer is, make
me one with everything.

00:15:11.684 --> 00:15:12.567 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>But you know what?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The other part-- he gives
the guy too much money,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and then he asks for change.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:23.415 align:middle line:84%
And the hot dog vendor says,
change comes from within.

00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>That's good.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:25.914 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>It's all good.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Name everything good.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.013 align:middle line:84%
>>It's all good in
God's neighborhood,

00:15:29.013 --> 00:15:33.572 align:middle line:84%
and God's neighborhood
is everywhere.

00:15:33.572 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>We're living in a
time in human history

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.255 align:middle line:84%
where a shift has
occurred in a major way.

00:15:39.255 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Men have a particular,
particular focus

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:90%
that we have to be about.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.702 align:middle line:84%
It's been this
whole masculine way

00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
of being in the world that has
caused a lot of the problems

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The raping of the Earth,
the pollution, the wars,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
the rumors of wars, the whole
acquisition consciousness

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of hoarding and getting and
domination, manipulation

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and control.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
It behooves us as men
to be able to become

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
very comfortable with
the feminine within us.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:90%
To embrace that.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
To fall back in love
with that aspect of us

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that is of the divine feminine,
and to allow it to balance

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
the masculine aspect
of ourself, for this

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is the time in
human history where

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that rising up of the
feminine is so very necessary.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
When we resolve to evolve,
our problems dissolve.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
If we live life according
to that pattern,

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
becoming a regifter
of the cosmic energy

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:84%
within us, embracing the
feminine that is within us,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:90%
there's hope for us.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.469 align:middle line:90%
There's hope for us all.

00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:48.731 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it is, Jay.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.875 align:middle line:90%
Be sure to step up to the plate.

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.355 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, Baba.

00:16:53.355 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>You the man.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.906 align:middle line:90%
You the man.

00:16:54.906 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.543 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:03.709 align:middle line:84%
>>We allow this moment of
gratitude and thanksgiving

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation to be the lens
through which we look at life.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.705 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we see infinite
possibilities

00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:90%
of love and peace and harmony.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
We take this opportunity
and bless each other.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
We bless the food
we're about to eat,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the nourishment of
light invades the body temple

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and allows us to be the strong
instrumentalities through which

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.779 align:middle line:84%
more love and more peace and
more joy and more creativity

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:90%
graces the planet.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
For this and more than words can
ever say, we remain thankful,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and we let it be.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.963 align:middle line:90%
>>And so it is.

00:17:38.963 --> 00:17:39.462 align:middle line:90%
>>Amen.

00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:41.721 align:middle line:90%
>>Amen.

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Bon apetit, everybody.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's eat.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:10%
>>We're on the path of
spiritual liberation,

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:10%
embracing the impulse, the
presence of God within us.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the evolutionary impulse
that governs the universe.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:84%
We are moving from being snagged
by the ego's perception that

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
shows a world of lack and
limitation and scarcity.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interested
in the temporal.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.486 align:middle line:84%
It's very interested in
that which is transitory.

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're moving until you're
more interested in the eternal,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing
the eternal into time.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.115 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing love, peace,
joy, wisdom, justice, harmony,

00:18:21.115 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
well-being, prosperity.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
All the harmonizing
goodness of the universe.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing that
into the transitory.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
You're glowing in
the transitory.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I begin by
understanding that as I'm

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
activating this potential
through my affirmative prayer,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:84%
my meditation, my sacred
service, my fellowship,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
my study, all the ways that I
become a strong instrumentality

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
through which this life can
begin to flow through me.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.749 align:middle line:90%
And understand this.

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of how
many mistakes we've

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
made, regardless of how
many times we've fallen,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.455 align:middle line:84%
regardless of all the
things that have gone wrong

00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in our life, then life doesn't
know anything about that.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Life only knows itself.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Life is alive, you see?

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And the moment the yes
factor is higher than maybe,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know,
and no, it begins

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to retool every
area in our life,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and it uses all the
bad stuff for good.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It uses everything
in your life in order

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
for you to give your gift to the
universe, your gift to spirit,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:90%
your gift to the world.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It uses everything that
has ever happened to you,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.744 align:middle line:84%
and it turns it all good
at that particular moment.

00:19:19.744 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever have to
ever think, I've blown it.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I've messed up.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.995 align:middle line:90%
I'll never be able to make it.

00:19:24.995 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll never be able to glow
for the presence of God.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I've blown it for so long.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
No, there is no time
in the spiritual realm.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The moment, you
know, when you turn

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
on the light-- the
electricity doesn't say,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
this person has had this
light switch off for 16 years.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.389 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:90%
They've made too many mistakes.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
They've walked in
the dark too long.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They haven't turned
on the light.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
I'm going to glow.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.292 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:19:50.292 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You turn on that light.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
If all the circuits are A-OK,
it's going to glow for you.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.295 align:middle line:84%
In that same way, you
turn on that inner light.

00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter how
many mistakes you've

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%
made in life, how many mistakes.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
You get it right one
time, it's all you need.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:90%
That connection, you see?

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.805 align:middle line:90%
Gift.

00:20:09.805 --> 00:20:10.304 align:middle line:90%
Gift.

00:20:10.304 --> 00:20:11.396 align:middle line:90%
Gift.

00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>You say this great thing that
I quote you all the time about.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.811 align:middle line:84%
You say you can't be
the light of the world

00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
if you can't pay
your light bill.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And what that tells me is
that there's this opportunity

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to give, but also be
responsible for your life.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean have dreams
that are pie in the sky dreams

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
that have no foundation to them.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
That there's a way to
live who you really

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
are, to actually be an
expression of who you are.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, pay attention

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
to your responsibility
to your family,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and to your spiritual
community, and to the world.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
We use these universal
spiritual principles

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize our
structures first.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That is, our health, our
finances, our right livelihood,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We get them stabilized
not as an endgame,

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
but as a leap off point
to go further into who

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.005 align:middle line:84%
and what we really
are, and to discover

00:21:05.005 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
our gifts of creativity,
and to express them.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Which you can't do that if
you're just trying to survive.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So we use the principles not
to become great consumers,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
not to just become
multi-millionaires

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:90%
just for the sake of that.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But we use the principles
to become stable

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
share who we really

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
are without having to
be overly concerned

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
about our health, our finances,
and those type of things.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The scary place, frankly,
is the financial picture,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:84%
because you still
have to pay the bills.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the spiritual
quandary I find myself in.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.645 align:middle line:84%
>>And there's also time
away from your kids, too.

00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:42.145 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:21:42.145 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>You're having kids--
with us, it's like,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.893 align:middle line:84%
do I do that movie over here,
and then am I the absentee dad?

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:50.812 align:middle line:90%
That's tricky stuff.

00:21:50.812 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>That spiritual
quandary that you're in,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
though, is also the
confusion that you're then

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
going to see in
your life because

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:90%
of your confusion in your mind.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn how
to maybe center yourself

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and meditate on it, and
really get to that place

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.043 align:middle line:84%
where your true self shines
through these equipments.

00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I think these things
we get presented

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.147 align:middle line:84%
with-- they're very
individual to us.

00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They're very unique.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain kind of
communication that comes,

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's the
opportunity that you

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
have to move out of the safety
of your present paradigm.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the opportunity
that you have to take a chance

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and do something different, and
really practice the principles.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we can go and listen
and hear and be so inspired,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and be inspired all day
or into the next day.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not actually
taking the things

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that Reverend Michael says, or
taking the things that we read

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and really implementing them--
I mean, our life has to be,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
really, our laboratory
where we really practice.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
things that scare us

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.551 align:middle line:84%
the most are the things
that really produce

00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
and lasting results.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>All of nature is
in glee and ecstasy

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
for simply being
able to participate

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:90%
in the divine realm.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And you are moving from
meditation to celebration,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
paying indestructible attention
to that wholesome and whole

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
soul reality so that
you can consciously

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
celebrate your
participation in the divine,

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:84%
not distracted by the issues,
the challenges, the obstacles,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the hindrances
that you're facing

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:90%
or that may be facing you.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But allowing that celebration
to so take you over

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that it liberates your
mind, liberates your soul,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
liberates your heart so
that the destiny that

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is within you, as a singular
manifestation of a cosmic good

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that is seeking by
means of you to unfold

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
can unfold-- with your
permission, by the way.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you feeling
what I am saying?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you're
stepping into the field

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual liberation.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
That is, the conscious
embracing of this impulse that

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
allows you to unhook from the
filter, the perception that

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.395 align:middle line:90%
ego casts in front of you.

00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:05.425 align:middle line:84%
You're able to unhook
from the ego concerns

00:24:05.425 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to be
guided by your sole faculty.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>I I had a really profound
moment happen in sports.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.705 align:middle line:90%
The Lakers won the championship.

00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It was Kobe's
first championship.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never
forget this moment.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Just won. they put a
microphone in his face.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:90%
They go, how do you feel?

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, wait
until next year.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.488 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get him again.

00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:26.642 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, wow, he
couldn't enjoy the moment?

00:24:26.642 --> 00:24:29.348 align:middle line:90%
Maybe for a second?

00:24:29.348 --> 00:24:31.744 align:middle line:84%
You know, so here,
his whole life, this

00:24:31.744 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is what he wanted to
achieve, and now he

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:90%
can't wait until the next year.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Wait!

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.135 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna get them again.

00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I go, whoa.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it's about?

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So it goes to show you
that those achievements--

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
they're all thoughts.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, that's
what I used to have.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And now that I've had
them, I understand.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's taken an entirely different
direction, so much of it

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
inspired by coming to
church here for 18 years.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
It was just allowing
the me to come out

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:90%
that was there since birth.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>That's a very good point--
allowing the me to come out.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the goals are not
just about accomplishment.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.614 align:middle line:84%
It's what you become in the
process of going after it.

00:25:08.614 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, what you
eliminate within yourself--

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
the ego, the false pride,
the apathy or lethargy.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you have to
do to get to a certain level.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.984 align:middle line:84%
It's not just getting
that accomplishment.

00:25:20.984 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It's what you're
becoming along the way.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.483 align:middle line:84%
That's really what you
get to take with you.

00:25:24.483 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of your soul.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.449 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a fine acting
job, or a bit of healing,

00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
or architecture, or
a piece of music.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's what you become in the
process of delivering that.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And that was really powerful,
because you spoke not just

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:84%
about the fear of failure--
can we handle failure?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Can we manage success?

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.595 align:middle line:90%
Can we survive success?

00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Can we survive success?

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you handle success?

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you handle
being magnificent?

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.296 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle greatness?

00:25:54.296 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you handle
what they're going

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.755 align:middle line:84%
to say about you when you
begin to have your light shine

00:25:57.755 --> 00:25:58.535 align:middle line:90%
a little bright?

00:25:58.535 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle that?

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Can you handle mediocrity
attacking your excellence

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
when it starts to
flow through you?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you handle all the stuff
that when you start to really

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
shine and break free from
the mediocrity on the level

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of the human mundanity--
can you handle

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.674 align:middle line:84%
what comes at you
when that takes place?

00:26:18.674 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you say yes tot hat?

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm at this point
my life that's

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
a big transition going on,
and I feel it inside of me.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And today pushed me over,
because you had us saying yes,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
though, that the last yes

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that you said-- I had a hard
time doing that definitive yes.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:90%
It frightened me.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Which was the last yes?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>It was about mediocrity.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to give up
the people of mediocrity that

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
are going to try to take
you down, basically?

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't willing to make
that commitment at that time.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I was going, yes, yes,
and I went, yeah, kind of.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Because those people
really do affect me.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not willing
to give that up yet.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And of all the yeses,
you would think

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that would be the one
that would be the easiest,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.184 align:middle line:84%
but that was the most
difficult for me,

00:27:07.184 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
want to just fake it.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to say yes for
the sake of saying it, just

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to be spiritual and uplifted,
and now I'm going to get this.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>In that moment, you're
coming to an understanding

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that you are here as a
bearer of the gift that

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
is lodged within you that
you are setting free.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, you
are releasing attachment

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to outcomes, but
the outcomes are

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
bigger than you could
possibly imagine.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in the field
of birthing the gift economy--

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual gift domain
where individuals are living

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
on this planet to share,
to shine, to glow, to give,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
to radiate the gift that
is within them as a matter

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of course, magnifying
and multiplying

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the living
God that is within them.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
You are here to bear gifts at
that dimension, at that domain,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:90%
at that level.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And when that
begins to happen, I

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
want you to imagine
a world, now,

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in which the ego has not
siphoned off that impulse

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and created hoarding,
and created a stinginess,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and created all manner of ways
that have produced stagnation

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
in immature economic systems,
where there's evidence of lack

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
and limitation, and not enough.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine a world in
which individuals are here

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.146 align:middle line:84%
to share and shine and
glow and give their gifts.

00:28:33.146 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, what is it that
really wants to emerge in you?

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.756 align:middle line:90%
What are you stifling?

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:40.454 align:middle line:84%
What gifts are trying
to come forward?

00:28:40.454 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then give
permission for that,

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and become willing to
walk through that fear.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:48.474 align:middle line:84%
>>It was just last month I
finally got what that meant.

00:28:48.474 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard you
say it so many times.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
So many times.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a place where
I was under a circumstance,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and I was going, should I choose
this way of dealing with it,

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:90%
or should I choose that way?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And both had valid
arguments, and I

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't know which
way I should choose.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said,
well, the rev would say,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
what's seeking to emerge
in this situation?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Which took me out of
the equation completely.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was so beautiful,
because from that, I could see,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:90%
oh.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I see that there's
peace that's emerging.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
There's love and
compassion that's

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:84%
emerging within
this circumstance.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that, to
me, was so helpful.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>On a national scale,
there's something

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:90%
trying to emerge in America.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Compassion's trying to emerge.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to happen.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And the America right or
wrong consciousness is dying.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And now, humanitarian
vibration is rising.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Compassion is rising.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what's trying to happen.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's coming
through suffering.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
People losing things
tremendously-- things

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:90%
they thought were valuable.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's
coming through insight.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming, one
way or the other.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Even the notion that
nothing would stop terrorism,

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:84%
no military force
would stop terrorism.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be a
shift from a take economy

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:90%
to a give economy.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.295 align:middle line:84%
Once there's plenty
that people have,

00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:16.183 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going to be
in the business of terrorism.

00:30:16.183 --> 00:30:17.932 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine once
broke it down to me,

00:30:17.932 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and he said that plenty
equals choice equals freedom.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Scarcity equals
dependence equals control.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.609 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:30:29.609 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you can
create an environment

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
where people think things are
scarce, then they're dependent.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.725 align:middle line:84%
If they're dependent,
you can control them.

00:30:36.725 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Or you think you can.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.141 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:39.364 align:middle line:90%
>>And we find out we can't.

00:30:39.364 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>That was the
Rand Institute that

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
talked about that
particular study.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Understand why the Rand
Institution recently said,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:84%
after a lengthy
research project,

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
said that there is no military
solution to terrorism at all.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The only solution is
when so called terrorists

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:84%
are brought into the
political system.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that happens when there's
enough food, water, shelter,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.011 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:31:08.011 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
When there is enough of the
fundamental needs being met,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
then terrorism dissolves
in that particular area.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So if we're living in a gift
economy, rather than a hoarding

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.830 align:middle line:84%
economy, we're living in a
gift economy, rather than

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.988 align:middle line:84%
an acquisition economy,
we're living in a gift

00:31:30.988 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than a get
economy, you're

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
talking about the birth of a
kind and just global society

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
where everyone has what they
need as the fundamentals,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.688 align:middle line:90%
as the rock bottom fundamentals.

00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:47.562 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Where does it begin?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>People are quick to
look at the stock market

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and say that it's
good if it's going up,

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.755 align:middle line:84%
and it's bad if it's going down,
when in truth, it may not even

00:31:58.755 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:90%
mean that at all.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you look
at pharmaceuticals,

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
you look at prisons, you look
at war, you look at ammunition.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You look at a lot of things,
and when they're selling high,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.919 align:middle line:90%
the stock market is up.

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
That means that more
people are sick,

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.369 align:middle line:90%
more people are being arrested.

00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Many negative things happen that
are driving the stock market

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.410 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But what if
suddenly, people were

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and stop
eating bad food?

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.541 align:middle line:90%
Stop eating fast food?

00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:23.540 align:middle line:84%
What if they would wake
up and start exercising?

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.039 align:middle line:84%
What if they would
wake up and start

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
doing a tremendous amount
of preventative measures?

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Then the pharmaceutical
company would go down,

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:84%
the stock market
would go down, but it

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.207 align:middle line:90%
would reflect something good.

00:32:34.207 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really
look at the stock market

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
as an indicator of something
good, other than profit.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And all profit is
not a good thing.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're
looking at an evolving

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness
and an evolving economy,

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:84%
where noble profit-- where
real profit is really

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.490 align:middle line:84%
about the business of not only
your business flourishing,

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a measure of
how much you're giving back.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's also a measure
of how you're

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
contributing to the global
society of everyone's needs

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
being met, producing a society
of creativity and evolution

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>That is the universal one, now
expressing itself through you.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can't take
credit for that.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.510 align:middle line:84%
You are now bearing a
gift of the universe.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You can see this played out
a lot of time in celebrity.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You can see this being played
out a lot of times in athletic,

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:84%
where an individual will make
a touchdown, or they'll dunk,

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
take all the credit.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll
flex, because they

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.021 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten that this is
a gift from the universal one

00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:90%
to express.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an activation of potential.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.652 align:middle line:90%
It is a gift.

00:33:42.652 --> 00:33:44.651 align:middle line:84%
And they have forgotten
there's many things that

00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
went behind them jumping over
that particular touchdown line.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:90%
There were blockers, probably.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.425 align:middle line:84%
There was probably
a quarterback.

00:33:50.425 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:90%
There was probably a coach.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
There was probably
a whole fan base.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.725 align:middle line:84%
There was probably
people practicing

00:33:55.725 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
for months and
months and months,

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:84%
working on that particular
execution of that play.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, their own
level of skill and development

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.289 align:middle line:84%
that allowed them to be at the
right place at the right time

00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to leap over that
particular goal line.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But the moment they
said me and mine,

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
moment, the ego

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
is taking that
particular impulse,

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and that life begins
to degenerate.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.779 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to see the
breakup of relationships.

00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see
alcoholism and drug abuse.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to
see all the things,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:84%
because the individual
cannot survive success,

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.730 align:middle line:84%
because they think
it's just them,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and they think it's a personal
accomplishment rather than

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:90%
a gift from God.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was listening
to you today,

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about the
football player, the basketball

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
player, the whoever
players, right?

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And they get that touchdown,
or they make that three points.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.980 align:middle line:90%
I, I, I. But it is them.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sure, they've
got people behind them,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:90%
but they have the ability.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:84%
What I was saying was it's not
just personal accomplishment.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an
activation of a potential,

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and that potential is universal.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the presence trying to
express itself through us.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Bill Russell, in
his autobiography,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
talks about the fact
that sometimes he

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:84%
would put his foot
on the court, and he

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
knew it was going to be a
special game, because all

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, winning and
losing didn't matter.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:84%
He was participating
in a flow of energy.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, he would
recognize the other player

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
on the other team
recognizing that, too,

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and they knew where the
ball was going to be passed.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.436 align:middle line:84%
He knew how to block the
shot before the person even

00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:84%
knew they were
going to shoot it.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they stepped
off the court,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.210 align:middle line:84%
they knew they had
participated in something.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.005 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter whether
they won or lost.

00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:84%
They were participating
in a flow of energy

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:90%
in which their best came out.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example of not
being attached to an outcome.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
great art comes from.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
This is where great music
comes from, great architecture,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:90%
great healing.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.319 align:middle line:84%
You're in the present
moment, but you

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:90%
don't have an attachment.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no detachment.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Detachment and non-attachment
are two different things.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.264 align:middle line:90%
Detachment is I don't care.

00:36:03.264 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to play.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be hurt anymore,
so I'm not going to play.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But non-attachment
is, I'm fully playing,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:84%
but with no attachment
to an outcome.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:90%
That is spiritual practice.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>You are here to break free.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You are here to
liberate yourself,

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
which means something
within you is saying,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.474 align:middle line:90%
in substance, liberty or death.

00:36:26.474 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a very serious kind of
thing, if you believe in death.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.025 align:middle line:84%
But liberty or death--
of course, Patrick Henry

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.650 align:middle line:84%
said, give me liberty
or give me death,

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
but we're spiritualizing that
in this particular domain,

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and coming to an understanding
that there's a power within us.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Great potential within us.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And this power that is
within us can save us.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It can set us free or, if
denied, it will kill us.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We will live a life of
terminal frustration,

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:84%
becoming a part of
the walking dead that

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
becomes a part of the vampire
clan sucking the life out

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.274 align:middle line:84%
of those individuals who are
living a life of inspiration.

00:37:04.274 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that is not your lot, and
that is not your lot in life.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm committed
to certain things,

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
but then I always
think what prevents me

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:84%
from true magnificence is I look
at-- my child was next to me

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.112 align:middle line:90%
today in the service.

00:37:18.112 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going,
well, what about him?

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
He's used to a
certain lifestyle.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I don't know-- you
know, Jesus didn't have kids.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Not that you know of.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>He had disciples
that were worse.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.057 align:middle line:84%
>>But what your
kid gets from you,

00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
though, is that you're
going for excellence.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's what you're going for.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
My father is sitting back
there, and he went to law school

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:90%
when I was in high school.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were people around him
when he was a probation officer

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.895 align:middle line:90%
saying, what are you doing?

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:45.909 align:middle line:90%
You've got three kids.

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:84%
When did you know you
wanted to go to law school?

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:90%
What prompted that?

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>I guess the probation was
getting old at that time,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was a lot of caseloads
that I had to cover.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I wasn't
going anywhere,

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.790 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't involved
too much in administration.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a desk job.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So law appealed to me,
and a lot of the guys that

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:84%
were in probation were
going into law as well.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That was a long time ago, and
it was a challenge at the time,

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because nobody in the family
had ever been a lawyer.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.032 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I could make
it, so bam, there it was.

00:38:24.032 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>But when I got from that
was how it translated to me

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.819 align:middle line:84%
is he didn't let
anything stop him.

00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The people around him the
mediocre people saying,

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:90%
That translated into me.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.544 align:middle line:84%
That's what your
kid's gonna get.

00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Same with me.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Growing up with my dad as
an independent filmmaker

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
was very much the
paterno-fascist, but a by any

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:84%
means necessary
kind of filmmaker.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Which really passed along
to me a sense of there

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.934 align:middle line:84%
was no reason that
you couldn't do it.

00:38:54.934 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>And so as the filters-- as
you are liberating yourself

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
from the grasp of
the ego, you begin

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to see life a
little differently.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:10%
And you can tell
when the ego has you,

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:10%
because the ego is concerned
with the temporary.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:10%
The ego is concerned
with the transitory,

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:10%
whereas your soul is
concerned with eternity.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is concerned with
the eternal [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:84%
The ego is concerned with
the temporary zone-- what

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.295 align:middle line:84%
you may lose, how
you may get hurt,

00:39:23.295 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:84%
what might happen if you take a
step forward, where the soul is

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.305 align:middle line:84%
aware of the eternal
qualities of the spirit.

00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The love, the peace, the joy,
the kindness, the well being.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
always tell where you

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:84%
are as you're
moving through life.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Am I looking at life through
the ego, the temporal zone,

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.135 align:middle line:84%
or am I looking at my
life through my soul,

00:39:44.135 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:90%
through my divine spirit?

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And I am here to release the
energy of love, peace, joy,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.210 align:middle line:90%
wisdom, and harmony.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:84%
This gives you
kind of a barometer

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:84%
as to where you're
living your life.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you're stuck in the
muck of the transitory, when

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:84%
you become conscious
of that, you

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:84%
begin to elevate your
awareness through

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
your soulful affirmation,
your introspection,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
your contemplation, your
taking the stand for life.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then watch as
you become unhooked

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
by the malicious hypnotism of
the world that will tell you

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that you are a consumer
and not a creator.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>We share our gifts.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
We activate our
potential, and then

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.147 align:middle line:84%
share who we are as
a matter of course.

00:40:27.147 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
The world would look a lot
differently than it does now.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
The sense of scarcity
would die out.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
People's basic
needs would be met.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Terrorism would dissolve.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And we'd begin to live
in a society in which

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
the basic needs would be
met, creativity and beauty

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:84%
would flower, and the
evolution of one's soul

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:90%
would be why we are here.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I see us going.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.569 align:middle line:84%
That's where I see is the
next step of human evolution.

00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:52.610 align:middle line:90%
But it begins right here.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.625 align:middle line:84%
It begins within
our own thought--

00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.030 align:middle line:90%
our own consciousness.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Our life glows and grows
from glory to a greater glory.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.295 align:middle line:90%
Oh, feel it now.

00:41:10.295 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
spiritual liberation.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Not religiosity.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.418 align:middle line:90%
Not churchianity.

00:41:19.418 --> 00:41:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.035 align:middle line:84%
We're talking connection
with the divine.

00:41:28.035 --> 00:41:30.815 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel it?

00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:90%
[? Ricky BB ?], anchor.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.828 align:middle line:90%
Help them anchor the feeling.

00:41:34.828 --> 00:41:37.757 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.757 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>At least for myself, anyway,
I know that when I was younger,

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:84%
it was all about
what I could achieve.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
satisfy this idea

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of what I thought success was.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I would do
something that I was proud of

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and that my family was proud,
I was marking my territory.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, I did that.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I was able to do this.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But I found that as I got
more into my spiritual

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
walk, and really doing
the practice, really

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
with the meditation and
really with the readings.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>[SINGING]

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.935 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Then I began to
identify with something

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:84%
beyond what I
thought success was.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.300 align:middle line:84%
What was revealed
to me was something

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't have met
for myself, because you

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:30.140 align:middle line:84%
said something about I can
achieve the inner success.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
that we really know

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
what that is until
we do the work,

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:90%
and then it reveals what it is.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's really something
quite phenomenal.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Way more than I ever expected.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:84%
That now, when
something great happens,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not a personal
success at all.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no way we could
claim credit for it.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't do it for
the credit, you know?

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.185 align:middle line:90%
We do it for the joy.

00:42:53.185 --> 00:42:56.448 align:middle line:90%

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Because we're involved--
not merely enthralled,

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but involved-- with
supreme inspiration.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.600 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of the
most high, the presence.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just
for a moment, take

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.896 align:middle line:84%
the hand of the
individual next to you.

00:43:22.896 --> 00:43:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Because in this unified

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Someone once said,
who is your neighbor?

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the unified field,
since we're all connected,

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:84%
we know that everyone
is our neighbor.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.870 align:middle line:90%
No one is left out.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So whose hand you're
holding represents

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.529 align:middle line:90%
everyone in the sanctuary.

00:43:40.529 --> 00:43:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that they're
connected with.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Everyone they're connected with.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.413 align:middle line:90%
Everyone they're connected with.

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We bless those in front
of us, those behind us,

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%

that are now being given.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're giving and
receiving simultaneously.

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It's in breath, out breath.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's availability.

We're a part of the birth

We're a part of the birth of a

and unite with that part
of our being that is truth

00:50:56.665 --> 00:51:00.830 align:middle line:84%

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.710 align:middle line:90%
He's a DJ, I'm an actress.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.090 align:middle line:84%
We stepped outside the
box in our own careers,

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and he's always supported
us to do anything.

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.930 align:middle line:84%
To know that your father
supports you in anything

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that you do just makes
you feel like you

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.260 align:middle line:90%
can take over the world.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.220 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So I think that that's--

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>You're taking over
this interview, dude.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Sorry.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Can we just step out?

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>I would say that he's
always walked the walk.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, I mean, the green
shakes-- when there was a test,

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:13.380 align:middle line:90%
if he knew I had a test--

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, goodness.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.021 align:middle line:90%
>>There was a green shake.

00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Drink this, boy.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:17.311 align:middle line:90%
>>Drink this.

00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:18.500 align:middle line:90%
You need to drink this.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:84%
This is gonna make the
power go to your head.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.430 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna have all the
answers and all the energy.

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Like, six, seven years old.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We do pretty good
imitations of him, yes?

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.660 align:middle line:90%
The power is within you.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside of yourself.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Are you catching this?

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.562 align:middle line:90%
>>You getting this?

00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Are you getting this?

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that
definitely, something

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.060 align:middle line:84%
is-- I want to say channeling
or coming through him.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>It still amazes me, and
I've known him my whole life.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And watching him-- we go
to church every Sunday.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how do you put
all those words together?

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.552 align:middle line:90%
>>Just [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:53.552 --> 00:55:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>He's a fun dude
to be around, too.

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:58.570 align:middle line:90%
He's cool.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:55:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Any questions?

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.347 align:middle line:90%
>>So.

00:56:01.347 --> 00:56:13.734 align:middle line:90%
