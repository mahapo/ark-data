questions, you can't stop.

>>You see, good health
makes a lot of sense,

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't make
a lot of dollars.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:10%
And not considering
nutrition seriously,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:10%
we've done a terrible
disservice to all these people.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%

every language, every country,
every person in the world

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%
knows it.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.815 align:middle line:90%
Food does matter.

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:08.285 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:90%
>>The supermarket.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Symbol of the high standard of
living in this country today.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:10%
These products come
from farms and ranches

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:10%
despite distance and season.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They are the result of a
miraculous agriculture,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
maintaining farm-fresh
quality all the way

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
to your dinner table.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:10%
>>How old is your food?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:10%
If you think about it, your food
really, in the best of times,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:10%
is traveling between 1,500 and
2,000 miles before you get it.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's at least a week old.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Which becomes the next question.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
How much nutritional
value are you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
getting from food that's
at least five days old?

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you're lucky,
you're getting

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
maybe 40% of what you need.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:10%
>>Nearly every
food that you will

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:10%
find in the shops in a big
city has been processed.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It has been delayed
to the shops.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.085 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, nutrients have
deteriorated or disappeared

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
from the food by the time
it gets onto the plate.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.109 align:middle line:10%
>>We, for whatever
reason, decided

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:10%
we're going to spray everything
with every kind of pesticide,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:10%
herbicide, larvicide, fungicide.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We decided we're going to
genetically modify things

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:90%
we don't know anything about.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:10%
>>And one of the major problems
is, of course, the soil

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:10%
and what we do to the soil
and the air and the water,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:10%
and everything we
take in our food.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.265 align:middle line:84%
>>Soil are used, used, and used;
and nutrients are drawn out

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
of the soils, and the
soils become new deserts.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's happening worldwide.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And we do really need to look
at our systems of agriculture,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.985 align:middle line:84%
and we-- what we
are really eating

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:90%
and how we are producing food.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>The so-called fertilizer is
made up of three-- mainly three

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
minerals, NPK: Nitrogen,
Phosphorus, and Potassium.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's nice.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that the soil requires

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
approximately 52
different minerals.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So where's the calcium
and the magnesium

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and the manganese and the
zinc and the iron and all

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of the other things
I can't mention?

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:90%
They're missing.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But when the soil is
deficient, the plants also

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
are deficient and weakened,
and they lose their defenses.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And the bugs come
and attack them,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and the disease-- the
fungus and other disease

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
comes and attacks them.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So now they come crying to
the chemical company and say,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
well, our plants are
dying, and they won't grow,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and we have pests.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the
chemical companies

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:10%
are terribly happy to sell
them pesticides and fungicides

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:10%
and growth stimulants and
all kinds of other things.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Through his intellect, man
has developed a superiority

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
over every other
form of animal life.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
From his modern chemistry,
biology, and dedicated research

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.412 align:middle line:84%
have come thousands of
effective chemicals compounds,

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
all to help revolutionize
the productivity

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
of our own agriculture.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>So what we are
getting, even if we

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
eat just commercial,
vegetarian food,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:90%
we get deficient, toxic food.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.505 align:middle line:84%
Because with all these
pesticides and chemicals

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and sprays and all of that,
the food is not healthy.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's deficient.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.515 align:middle line:84%
So we can't help but
be deficient and toxic.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.726 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>And then, then we cook it.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And studies show that even if
you lightly steam your food,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.544 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose the
enzymes that are in it.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>The simplest
thing is that there

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
are live enzymes or live
workers inside of foods that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
help with your body's
digestion of foods

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and the use of the
nutrients that are there.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So raw foods should be a
part of everybody's diet.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.124 align:middle line:10%
>>When you cook food, the immune
system reacts to it as a toxin.

00:06:25.124 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
When you cook your food, the
body goes through a process

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
called digestive leukocytosis
where it starts generating

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
white cell activity against
the cooked food you've eaten,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
presumably because the cooking
process has bastardized

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
the food structure in a way
that the body cannot recognize,

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and so the body is now
treating that food as a toxin.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That's not a good thing for
your body to do to the food

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that you're hoping is
going to nourish you.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a Swiss doctor by
the name of Paul Kouchakoff.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
He was the first to
show in the 1930s

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that if you ate a diet that
was more than 51% cooked

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
food, that your body
would react to the food

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
as if it was being invaded
by a foreign organism.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kouchakoff was the
first to demonstrate

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that if 51% of your
meals were raw,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that you would have
no leukocytosis

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
or you would actually have
no white blood cell reaction.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So your immune
system would not be

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.589 align:middle line:90%
activated with a false alarm.

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we're dealing with
so many immune system issues

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
today, we have to make
sure that at least 51%

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of every meal that we have is
raw so that we don't overburden

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.822 align:middle line:84%
that already burdened
immune system.

00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:10%
>>How can you build
a building that you

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:10%
expect to last 100 years if you
put poor building materials in?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.425 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with your body.

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
How can you expect your body to
last for a long and enjoyable

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
lifetime if you don't
put the proper building

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:90%
blocks in there?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows we
are what we eat.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
If you eat garbage, you're
going to get garbage.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Think of it as
chronic malnutrition,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:90%
because that's what's going on.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
That's why people are tired.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to be
tired in the afternoon.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be alive and vibrant.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:10%
>>This has led people naturally
to discover superfoods

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:10%
and discover that
certain foods have

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary quality
of vitamins and minerals

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of
cofactors and enzymes

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:10%
and special chemicals that, for
example, will cause us to live

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:10%
longer, will cause
our skin to be

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:10%
softer, et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Spirulina was consumed in Mexico
City as the primary protein

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:10%
source for 5,000 years.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina is the highest protein
content food in the world.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The Max Planck Institute
discovered that 50% of protein

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is destroyed in any food
once you cook the food.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, superfood,
plant-based protein sources

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a key
food of the future.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we can get
all the protein

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:90%
that we need from those sources.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They've been undamaged
by heat, and they

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:90%
are completely absorbable.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:90%
They can be liquefied easily.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
saying by absorbable.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
How much energy do
you think it takes

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to turn spirulina into a
liquid and get in your body?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you put spirulina in
water, it's already liquefied.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You drink it, it will go right
into your cells like that.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But a steak requires a
massive amount of energy

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to liquefy it and
make it absorbable

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:90%
by your digestive system.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>These superfoods can
confer exceptional properties

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.923 align:middle line:90%
to your health and well-being.

00:09:39.923 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>Cacao beans stack up
on the mineral content

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.985 align:middle line:90%
against anything in the world.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest natural
source of magnesium.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest natural
source of chromium.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very likely the highest
natural source of iron.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It's very likely the highest
natural source of manganese.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest
contents of zinc.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest
contents of copper.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
All the cofactors needed
for healthy metabolism,

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:90%
it's in the cacao bean.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the highest vitamin
C content foods in the world,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
but all processed chocolate
has no vitamin C in it,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
because heat destroys
vitamin C. It

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
has the highest
antioxidant content.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
That means that if we are really
going to take advantage of what

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
we learned in nutrition,
that antioxidants protect us

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
from DNA damage,
viral damage, cancer,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
protect us from skin damage,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
it's either going to be
this and then we eat,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to be
this and then we eat.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And this right here could
be the most horrid chemical

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
soup of all time, or it could
be the most extraordinary

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
superfood of all time.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same amount of
work to get it into our mounts.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We probably, as a culture,
have got our values inverted.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
We'd rather spend money on rent
than we would on the best food

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We'd rather spend money
on a car or a house

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
than on feeding our children
the greatest superfoods that

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
have ever been
discovered in the world.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't know.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just a values inversion,
because we just got confused.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.089 align:middle line:84%
We saw some program that
sold us on buying this car,

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly we're buying
that car when really we

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.379 align:middle line:84%
should take that money and
invest it into our family's

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
health by the best food
ever, which is the basis.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>If I eat a lousy
bread roll every day,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
have a cup of tea for
breakfast and a piece of toast,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
a sugary drink for mid
morning, a doughnut for lunch,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.872 align:middle line:84%
and take away fried
chicken at night,

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
massively deficient

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:90%
in a whole range of nutrients.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one day.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to need something
in the way of supplement.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, I eat
salad until it's coming out

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
of my ears to try
and make up for it.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But I never ever
correct the deficiency

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that occurred from
the day before.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be a
residual problem somewhere.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot punish your cells
without having to pay for it

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
sooner or later.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>We are lucky.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:10%
In the last 100 years,
we went from not

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:10%
having any vitamin supplements
to having them over the counter

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:10%
and readily available.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:10%
And yet most people don't know
how important vitamins really

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:10%
are.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And if they take
large enough doses,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
they can use them
to prevent illness.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And if they take
large enough doses,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
they can use them
to treat illness.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Once again, how can that be?

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear it on the news.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:10%
In fact, on the news,
it said you shouldn't

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.765 align:middle line:10%
take too many of those vitamins.

00:12:47.765 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It might not be a good idea.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet they don't provide
any evidence of that.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
They just say it.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.565 align:middle line:84%
Doctors say, I don't
believe in vitamins.

00:12:57.565 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're not
going to a shaman.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to be
going to a scientist here.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not about belief;
it's about facts.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 23
years, according

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
to the American Association
of Poison Control Centers,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
there have been 10--
a total of 10-- deaths

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
alleged to be
caused by vitamins.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
That's one zero,
10, in 23 years.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
That's less than half
a death per year.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And these are
unproven, unverified.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.746 align:middle line:84%
But they are attributed
to vitamin consumption.

00:13:37.746 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a nation where the very
thing that will help people

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is being presented as
actually dangerous.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:10%
There have been
studies that purport

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:10%
to show that if you take an
extra multivitamin every day

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:10%
that it's going to hurt you,
and that's just nonsense.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
There are studies
that purport to say

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that vitamin C will
cause a kidney stone.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've searched
the medical literature,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked all
my students to search

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
the medical literature, and
my colleagues to search it,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as they
find scientific evidence

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of a vitamin C-caused kidney
stone, send me the paper,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:90%
send me the reference.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been 30 years, and
I've never gotten one.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, either everybody's
dumb, or it's a myth.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There's an assumption that
vitamins are basically

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
like drugs and should
be regulated like drugs.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
There's an assumption that if
it's therapeutically valuable,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
it must be dangerous,
because drugs are.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have been
taught our whole lives

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:84%
to be consumers, mostly
consumers of modern medicine,

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
which is pharmaceutical
medicine.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:10%
>>What about drugs that
you get by prescription?

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, nowadays, there
are many powerful drugs

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:10%
that are not safe to take
without a doctor's supervision.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.885 align:middle line:84%
But you can rely upon your
doctor and your pharmacist.

00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They are both
professionally trained men.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
A druggist must have
received training

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:90%
at an accredited college.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>A doctor goes
to medical school,

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
gets a medical education,
practices medicine,

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
prescribes medicines,
and is called an MD.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's put nutrition into
that and see how it sounds.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:84%
My doctor is a nutritionist
who went to nutritional school,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
studied nutrition, and
has a nutritional degree,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and prescribes nutrients.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:90%
It sounds very strange.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
When we say I went
to that doctor,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.615 align:middle line:84%
it's implicit that the
doctor was a medical doctor.

00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>It surprised me
in my clinical years

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that nobody was interested
in the patients' diets.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
When I spoke to my profs, they
weren't interested in diets.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The patients weren't
interested in diets,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.119 align:middle line:90%
and neither were the hospital.

00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:90%
So diet didn't come into it.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I mentioned
it, the nutrition,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.965 align:middle line:84%
it was basically
put to the side.

00:15:46.965 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>I spent time as a student
at the Brigham Hospital

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
in Boston, which is right
next to Harvard Med.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.777 align:middle line:84%
And even then, back in 1974,
it was a crisis hospital.

00:16:05.777 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There were more
doctors than patients.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It was really a grim place.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And I got a chance
to see, to observe,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and to see the
failure of medicine.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
You would see people
like the one woman

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember with leukemia.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.358 align:middle line:84%
They would give her Jello
and white bread to eat.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that Jello
and white bread cause cancer,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:90%
but they sure aren't the cure.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>26% of patients who are
discharged from hospitals

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
are more malnourished
than when they went in.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they go
in in 80% to 90% of cases

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
is related to their
poor state of nutrition.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I started reading papers
by William J. McCormick

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and Frederick Robert
Klenner, the pioneers

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
of using high
doses of vitamin C.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:10%
And these gentleman were
curing viral disease

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:10%
with high doses of
vitamin C in the 1940s.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And then I had a poser.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, just a minute here.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Hold on a second.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
These are medical doctors,
and they're using vitamins.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're using high
doses of vitamins,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:90%
and they're getting success.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't get any
of this in college.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession, medical
education-- for that matter,

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
undergraduate education, common
education through magazines

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and television-- all
manage to walk around

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
the rhinoceros in
the living room.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the rhinoceros
in the living room.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, there's a
rhinoceros in the living room.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And there it was, right in the
center, this body of knowledge,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
this whole body of knowledge.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more I looked
into it, the more I found.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Linus Pauling first
suggested that vitamin C

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
could be useful against
the common cold.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.785 align:middle line:84%
But this was based on
quite a lot of science

00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and not
just a guess or a whim.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.865 align:middle line:84%
Pauling was, of course, a
colleague of Albert Einstein

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:13.605 align:middle line:84%
and quite a large number of
other high-level intellects

00:18:13.605 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:10%
And he won two Nobel prizes, one
in chemistry and one in peace.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So he's a brilliant man and
should not be taken lightly.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem was
that he was getting

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
in the area of
clinical medicine,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't have the
qualification in this area.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So he was, at the time,
very open to criticism.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And his suggestion
of vitamin C would

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on the
common cold was boo

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
hooed by the medical profession.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I must stay that the
medical profession is not always

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.755 align:middle line:84%
that scientific
and clear-thinking.

00:18:46.755 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And the other thing that
we have a problem here,

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
a public relations
problem with nutrients,

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is that one nutrient is
good for too many things.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin E is good to
fight heart disease.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:90%
It's also good to put on burns.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's also good to
help reduce seizures

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in teenagers that are epileptic.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's pretty diverse.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:10%
Vitamin C-- let's see,
antitoxin, antihistamine,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:10%
anti-viral, helps
regulate blood sugar,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.816 align:middle line:10%
helps to elevate mood in
people that are depressed.

00:19:19.816 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just too good
for too many things.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And I have an answer.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The reason one vitamin
can cure so many illnesses

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
is because the
deficiency of one vitamin

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.176 align:middle line:90%
can cause many illnesses.

00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:84%
There's only about
two dozen nutrients.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet in your body, there
are countless thousands

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:90%
of chemical reactions.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, anything
that's vitamin mediated,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
we can expect that
one vitamin is

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be involved
in multiple reactions.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
This is true with
the minerals as well.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We have an idea that
one drug, one disease.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an old medical idea.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
One drug, one disease,
the doctrine of specifics.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
true with nutrition.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>You cannot heal selectively.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
If you truly heal,
everything heals.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
If a patient comes, for
instance, not only with cancer

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but with high blood pressure
and/or diabetes and maybe

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
fibromyalgia and
other pains and so on,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
all the problems disappear.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't heal one disease
and keep two others.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
When the body heals,
it heals everything.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>You nourish the body,
and then the body fixes it.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
When people take
vitamins, the vitamins

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%
don't specifically do it.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.885 align:middle line:90%
They enable the body to do it.

00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They enable the
body to heal itself.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.451 align:middle line:84%
This is a totally different
way of looking at it.

00:20:48.451 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>The body has what my
father called its own healing

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
mechanism.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And he went further,
and he said,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
it's the doctor's duty to
activate and reactivate

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the body's own
healing mechanism.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And the patients heal.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you call the disease.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Not one cell in the human
body is made out of a drug.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Surgery doesn't put
anything into you.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They might put in
something made of plastic.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
They might take out
something that's harmful.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
cutting into the body

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really make it better.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.214 align:middle line:84%
Giving the body drugs doesn't
really promote health.

00:21:36.214 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we need
is a new paradigm.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We need a whole new
way of looking at it.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Boosting health has
not been tried yet.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind of the
one thing we haven't done.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
When nutrients are
tested as therapy,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:90%
they use very low doses.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
public and physicians

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
see all these research papers
that show ambiguous results.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
One study is published and says
vitamins help a little bit.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Another study is
published that says

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:90%
vitamins don't help very much.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
back and forth.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is because
all of those studies

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:90%
are low-dose studies.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>The recommended
daily allowance

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of
a nutrient that's

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
required by the majority
of the population

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to prevent an overt
deficiency disease.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
That is, if we give
everybody in Australia

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
the recommended intake of
vitamin C, 60 milligrams

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
per day, then we should not
see scurvy in this country.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
However, we still see
scurvy in this country.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>If you are indulging
in a high-stress job,

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a stressful
lifestyle-- you've

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
got some kids, running a
home, doing a job-- then

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the body is going to
be breaking vitamin

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:84%
c as you're
generating adrenaline.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the link between
stress and heart attacks,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that when you're stressed out,
the body is making adrenaline,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and that is drawing down levels
of vitamin C in the body.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
cause a vulnerability

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to your cardiovascular system
because of lack of vitamin C.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The medical profession
just treat disease.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't go back to the
primary causes of a lot

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:90%
of things, because they can't.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.285 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand what
chemicals come from exercise.

00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
what chemicals come out

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
what chemicals come out

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:90%
of your food.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Where conventional medicine
misses the boat in a big way

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:10%
is for long-term, hard to deal
with-- the chronic problems.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.115 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they miss the
boat with the chronic problems

00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:84%
is because they do nothing
to change the reason why

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the patient got the
disease in the first place.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.691 align:middle line:90%
Basically, they treat symptoms.

00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And if all you do
is treat symptoms,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
cure the disease.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
change the root cause.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It took me about two
years of seeing patients

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.255 align:middle line:84%
that should already have died
with conventional medicine

00:23:51.255 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:90%
with their prognosis.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to survive
more than just a few months

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:02.532 align:middle line:84%
under traditional clinical
conditions was very limited.

00:24:02.532 --> 00:24:03.906 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
patients, if they

00:24:03.906 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
would have followed conventional
medicine, would have died.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.899 align:middle line:84%
And after I had been with the
program for a couple of years,

00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and I see patient after patient
still alive and getting better,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
tumors going away, and multiple
sclerosis disappearing,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and arthritis going
away, lupus going away,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:84%
all these really
dramatic problems, that's

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
what really made me
100% fully convinced

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that I was in the
right line of work

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.605 align:middle line:84%
and that this work really
had something valuable.

00:24:31.605 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Cardiovascular disease is
a disease of civilization.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:90%
It is a lifestyle disease.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we're eating too
much of the wrong thing,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and not enough of
the right thing.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And your grandmother said it,
and her grandmother said it,

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:90%
and everybody knows it's true.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it's
fast food, and meat,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and fat, and sugar, and
starch, and processed food

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that has few vitamins.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And don't take
vitamin supplements,

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:90%
because they might hurt you.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, cardiovascular
disease, that's not the risk.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been saying
for at least 25 years

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that cardiovascular
disease is reversible.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine has
claimed for a long time

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that it was not reversible.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>To look at the cure, I think,
tells us something of cause.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dean Ornish has
done a really good job

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
with people who have severe
cardiovascular disease.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And he puts them
on a strict diet,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.870 align:middle line:84%
which is basically
a vegetarian diet.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
That means a plant-based
diet, a high fiber diet,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
loaded with vitamins
and nutrients

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and good things that
grow on the ground,

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
or at least ground that's
organically attended.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Ornish also has a
new stress reduction.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
able to arrest or reverse

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular disease
in a year or two.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The cause of
cardiovascular disease,

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
therefore, is a failure to
take the vitamins and a failure

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:90%
to eat right.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that even people

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
with advanced cardiovascular
disease, when they start

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
taking the nutrients and
they change their diet,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.075 align:middle line:84%
they can arrest it or
reverse it without surgery.

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.117 align:middle line:84%
>>What amazed me is that we
have some very smart people.

00:26:15.117 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We have the brightest
and the best wandering

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
the corridors of our
leading medical institutions

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
with unlimited
budgets, and they don't

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
seem to want to finger food
and also the Western lifestyle

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:90%
as being causative.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, about
half of all deaths

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:90%
are from cardiovascular disease.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And in half of those deaths,
the first symptom is death.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So people can go through
their life for decades

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
with no symptoms at
all and then drop dead.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
it's too late.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for a drug.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for a bypass.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for the ambulance.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It's too late for resuscitation.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.912 align:middle line:84%
>>If one in every two
and a half people,

00:26:55.912 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
if you can picture
such a creature,

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:84%
are perishing from
cardiovascular problems,

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
that follows that
society is doing

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:90%
something fundamentally wrong.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>The only way to
win is not to play.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And that requires that
they change their life.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>And yet, what are we doing?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.082 align:middle line:84%
Every year, we're doing
billions of dollars

00:27:13.082 --> 00:27:15.415 align:middle line:84%
worth of bypass surgery that
could be totally controlled

00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
just by changing the way
you eat, drink, live.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Did I mention it was safer?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Did I mention it was cheaper?

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And it works very well.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, why don't
all cardiologists

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:90%
recommend this approach?

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fairness, not all
of them have studied it.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And in fairness,
the drug companies

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:90%
have something to say about it.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice there was
no drugs in there at all?

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
There's just, like, no
drug therapy at all.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just meditation
and vegetarian diet.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no profit in this.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>>One of the big problems
with the drug approach

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:10%
is the issue of side effects,
adverse drug reactions.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Just for a start, in the UK,
the generally accepted figure

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
of the number of people
who die each year

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
as a result of adverse drug
reactions is about 10,000.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
To put that in some
sort of perspective,

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the number of people who
die from motor car accidents

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:90%
is about 3,500.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We're all very worried
about motor car accidents.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to be so worried
about adverse drug reactions.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The number of people who die as
a result of prostate cancer--

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
which is of enormous concern,
and we have campaigns

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and so on-- is around about
9,000 in this country.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>The Journal of the
American Medical Association

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
published papers which indicated
that approximately 106,000

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Americans die from
pharmaceutical drugs each year.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are drugs that
are properly prescribed,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
not physician errors.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And these are side effects
that are normally expected.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are people who took
the medication as directed.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't count
overdoses or misuses.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So if 106,000 people die
from normal, expected side

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
effects of drugs just in America
just in one year, in 23 years,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that's an enormous
number of people.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We're talking millions of people
dead from pharmaceutical drugs.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And in 23 years, 10
allegedly dead from vitamins.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we have
to be a lot more

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
serious about
prescribing nutrition.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.595 align:middle line:84%
And as Roger Williams
said-- the discoverer

00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
of pantothenic acid-- when in
doubt, use nutrition first.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.739 align:middle line:84%
>>The pharmaceutical industry is
in business not to make drugs.

00:30:13.739 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:90%
It's in business to make money.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Which, I think, is
perfectly reasonable.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They are large,
international corporations,

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and they have a duty
to their shareholders.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what corporations
do, is they make money.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.182 align:middle line:84%
>>We live in a
capitalist society.

00:30:27.182 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't happen to
think that's a bad thing.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I think capitalism has
got its great advantages,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.425 align:middle line:84%
and I think it can
be abused roundly,

00:30:34.425 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and we've seen both sides of it.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>And the problem lies in the
way that they're regulated.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that we've got
some very good regulators,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:84%
but we've got some very
incompetent regulators as well.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>The bodies which are
required to both license drugs

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and then to see
what happens to them

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
afterwards are all paid
for by the drug companies.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
If you discovered that all the
people who were your hygiene

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
inspectors for restaurants were
all paid for by the restaurant

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:84%
owners, you might
be rather suspicious

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.655 align:middle line:90%
about their findings.

00:31:02.655 --> 00:31:04.821 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of situation
we have with the drugs,

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's what needs to change.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They pay the regulators
who are supposed

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:90%
to be overseeing the drugs.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They pay the academics
who are meant

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:90%
to be researching the drugs.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And very often, the
trials that they run

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
will be run by people who
are part of the drug company.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They also put in adverts
into the medical journals.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of the medical
journals are supported

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:90%
by drug company advertising.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:10%
>>If we check the medical
literature for the last 65, 75

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:10%
years, there are
thousands of papers

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.910 align:middle line:10%
showing that high doses
of nutrients cure disease.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of these papers,
you don't get to read.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they were published
in journals that, say,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the United States National
Library of Medicine

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:90%
refuses to index.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So there are medical
journals out there

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.980 align:middle line:90%
that are basically blacklisted.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.142 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is published in
certain medical journals--

00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
such as the Journal of
Orthomolecular Medicine,

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of which I am assistant editor--
whatever has been published

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
in our journal for
the last 41 years--

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's hundreds of
papers-- none of that

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:84%
is indexed by the US
National Library of Medicine,

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
self proclaimed as the largest
medical library on earth.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So that what looks like
pure, scientific academics

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
researching
journals, publishing,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and the whole edifice
of science is actually--

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:84%
has been turned by
the drug companies

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.204 align:middle line:84%
into an arm of their
marketing department.

00:32:39.204 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:10%
>>But I'd like to know about
health information that

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:10%
comes to us from advertising.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>>That's what we call
commercial health information.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a mighty big business.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Millions of dollars are spent
to advertise health products

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of pills
and other medicines

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of
aches and pains.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You see, sometimes the
advertising can be deceptive.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>There are 25% of the
TV ads in this country

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:90%
are drug commercials.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.660 align:middle line:90%
First question-- why?

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.247 align:middle line:84%
It's not because they like
spending a lot of money.

00:33:12.247 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's because while they're
spending hundreds of millions

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of dollars on TV time,
they're getting back billions

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:90%
on people buying those things.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Because people are sick.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:90%
They're not feeling well.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>We need drugs.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:10%
There's no question
about that at all.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:10%
Pain management, brilliant,
and drugs are necessary.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.540 align:middle line:10%
But there comes this whole
point where we live in a society

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:10%
where if a little is good,
more must be much better.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with
now a drug industry

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.449 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to find
a drug for everything.

00:33:41.449 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Got a bad attitude?

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Have a drug.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Feeling a little depressed?

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Have a drug.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And the public has
come to rely on it.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.690 align:middle line:84%
The public has come to
accept this whole idea

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of taking a pill to fix an ill.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>What would happen
if everybody ate

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:84%
lots and lots of fresh,
organic food that

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:90%
was minimally processed?

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd have an
epidemic of health.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the stock
market would tremble.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
The drug industry is a
half trillion dollar a year

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:90%
worldwide conglomerate.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Almost $300 billion
just in North America.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This is really,
really big business.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
everybody were well?

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:90%
There is no money in health.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
You see, good health
makes a lot of sense,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't make
a lot of dollars.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I think we can have an
ethical drug industry.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think we've really
got to start sharpening up

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
the divides between the
regulators and the people

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:90%
making the drugs.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is in absolute
shambles right now.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>The idea that all drugs are
firmly based in the evidence

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
non-drug treatments

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:84%
are just a mixture
of hope and delusion

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and placebo effect
and charlatans

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't really
stand up to examination.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, in order for
a drug to be licensed,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.540 align:middle line:84%
it has to show that it is more
effective than a placebo in two

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.114 align:middle line:90%
trials.

00:35:12.114 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean to say
that the drug company can't

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
do lots of other
trials in which it

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.840 align:middle line:84%
doesn't prove to
be more effective.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't need
to publish those.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:84%
What it needs to do is to go
along to the regulator and say,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.686 align:middle line:84%
we have these two
trials which show

00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that the drug is more
effective than a placebo.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Can we have a license
to market it, please?

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.365 align:middle line:10%
>>Now, these are samples taken
from manufacturers' batches

00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:10%
of insulin and antibiotic drugs.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.615 align:middle line:10%
We test them for purity and
potency before they're sold.

00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, new drugs
are always coming along.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And we make sure that
they've been tested and found

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to be safe before they're
put on the market.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>The doctors will
tell you that the drugs

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.520 align:middle line:90%
have been trialed and tested.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But what you have to realize
when you take a new drug

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is that you're
essentially embarking

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
on an uncontrolled experiment.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The drugs will only
have been tested

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of getting
their license on maybe at most

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:90%
a few thousand people.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And they are then going
to be given to, literally,

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:90%
to millions.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And within those
millions of people,

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be an
enormous range of the way

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that their systems work, the way
that they react to the drugs,

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and so people are going
to have side effects.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
fact that the problem

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that most people
in the West face

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.315 align:middle line:84%
are not really acute
disorders, which medicine

00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:38.815 align:middle line:84%
is very good at dealing with,
but they're chronic disorders.

00:36:38.815 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
They are disorders like
depression, diabetes, heart,

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.560 align:middle line:90%
arthritis, and so on.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.275 align:middle line:84%
They are things
which don't kill you,

00:36:45.275 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
but they just make
you rather miserable

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and feel rather
terrible, and they

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.010 align:middle line:90%
go on for a long period of time.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
kind of conditions

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that all of the drugs
are targeted at,

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
but they are the conditions that
drugs don't treat very well.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.014 align:middle line:84%
>>Short term, some of
them are very lifesaving.

00:37:03.014 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:90%
You need to have them.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.145 align:middle line:84%
Some of the corticosteroids,
some of the other things

00:37:06.145 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that everybody says no, no, no--
short-term lifesaving, fine.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotic, short-term
life saving, no problem.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I abhor having patients on
any long-term medication.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's almost no
medication in the world

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:23.550 align:middle line:90%
you can't get patients off of.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>The perfect drug from the
point of view of a drug company

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:84%
is one, first of all,
that doesn't kill people.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because people need to take the
drug for a long period of time

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
in order for it
to be profitable.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, are they the best
way to treat everything

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:90%
from the start?

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And the answer would seem
very clearly to be not.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And so for a lot of
the chronic conditions,

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.660 align:middle line:84%
it seems to make a lot
of sense to start off

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:84%
by doing what you can
with non-drug approaches,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
firstly because they are
very unlikely to have

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the same range of side
effects, and secondly

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.470 align:middle line:84%
because in a number of cases,
it looks as though they

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
have a better chance of
tackling the underlying problem

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
rather than simply
dealing with the symptoms.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Abram Hoffer
worked with Bill W,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.450 align:middle line:84%
the founder of
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And Bill W and Abram
became good friends.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Bill W suffered from
severe depression.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Abrams said, you should
take some niacin.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:10%
He suggested 3,000
milligrams of niacin a day.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.360 align:middle line:10%
That was the end of
Bill W's depression.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Bill W then suggested
to people that

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.252 align:middle line:84%
were alcoholic, why don't
you try taking niacin

00:38:32.252 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and see if it helps
your depression, see

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:90%
if it helps your alcoholism?

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of the
people that tried the niacin

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:90%
had great improvement.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So Bill W, founder of
Alcoholics Anonymous,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
wanted AA to use niacin
and vitamin therapy.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But AA, which had
already been infiltrated,

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say is a good word,
by the medical profession,

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:90%
rejected that.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So to this day,
Alcoholics Anonymous

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:02.360 align:middle line:84%
focuses on many laudable steps
that alcoholics can and should

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
do to stop drinking, but it does
not recommend vitamin therapy.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>At the time, when
there was concern--

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
a growing concern
about the issue

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of whether the antidepressant
SSRI drugs were causing

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:84%
suicide, and there had been a
few campaigners around about

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:84%
2000 who had been saying
that there were problems

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
with these drugs and the
regulatory authorities

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and the drug companies
had been denying it.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>We did a whole study
on those school shootings

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
over in America, and we studied
a number of these incidents.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And in most cases--
in most cases--

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:84%
the shooter is either
on or withdrawing

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.100 align:middle line:84%
from these types of psychiatric
medications at the time

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:90%
that they commit these offenses.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.383 align:middle line:84%
And yet none of this stuff
really comes out in the trials

00:39:47.383 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>And an American researcher
came up with the fact

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that Prozac, which was of course
the brand leader at the time,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.400 align:middle line:90%
was about to come off patent.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they wondered whether
there was a new drug coming up.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And they did some research, and
they found indeed there was.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a thing called
Prozac R, and there

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
had been some tinkering with
the molecular structure of it.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
produce a new drug,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to say what the
improvements are going to be.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the patent
application for Prozac R,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:84%
it said "will not cause the
suicidal thoughts and feelings

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
which are associated
with the existing drug,"

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:84%
precisely the thing that the
drug company had been denying

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
was going on for
the past 10 years.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>I worked with a lady once
who was suicidally depressed.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
She lived at home
with her family.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
She was in her
50s, and she spent

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.210 align:middle line:84%
all day sitting in a
corner, face to the corner.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't eat with anyone.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.122 align:middle line:90%
She was totally uncommunicative.

00:40:50.122 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:84%
She was under the care
of a psychiatrist,

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.862 align:middle line:90%
of course, as she should be.

00:40:53.862 --> 00:40:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And the psychiatrist
had her on a variety

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of medications, which
you would expect.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The family was wondering
about nutrition.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned to them about
Dr. Hoffer's work with niacin.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.105 align:middle line:84%
And they wondered how
much she needed to take.

00:41:07.105 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And this person was
very seriously ill.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that
Dr. Hoffer normally

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
gave about 3,000
milligrams a day of niacin,

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
but some people need a lot more,
especially very sick people.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.596 align:middle line:84%
And they should give her as much
as it takes to make her better.

00:41:22.596 --> 00:41:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, they figured
they could do that.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.941 align:middle line:84%
So at 11,500 milligrams
of niacin a day,

00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:29.940 align:middle line:84%
she was sitting at the
table and talking to them

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:90%
like nothing had happened.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So they went to
the psychiatrist,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
showed the psychiatrist
this recovered person,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and the psychiatrist
said, well, I

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.713 align:middle line:84%
don't think you should
take all that niacin.

00:41:41.713 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It might be harmful.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped
giving her the niacin,

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and she was back in the corner.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Safety with niacin?

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:59.769 align:middle line:84%
There's not one death from
niacin per year on average.

00:41:59.769 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:84%
There have been one
or two attributed

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
over the last 15 or 20
years, but there's not even

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:90%
one death per year from niacin.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And how many people
that are suicidally

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:84%
depressed actually go
and end their lives?

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Two handfuls of cashews give
you the therapeutic equivalent

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of a prescription
dose of Prozac.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, everyone then says,
oh two handfuls of cashews,

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:90%
isn't that fattening?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And my point is, do you care?

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to get
over the depression?

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.462 align:middle line:84%
We're having a difficult time
accepting a simple therapy.

00:43:04.462 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you can do.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
If someone is depressed,
the first thing they can do

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
is know that it's
OK to be depressed.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're malnourished,
you should be depressed.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So don't do that anymore.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Go and eat good food.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>What's going on in
the mind and the brain,

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:middle line:84%
whatever the mind
is, can be influenced

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:84%
by the nutrients and
chemicals going into it

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.569 align:middle line:90%
and what is happening as well.

00:43:30.569 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:84%
This is not to say that
psychological treatments aren't

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.359 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But you can't get anywhere
with a patient who's

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.900 align:middle line:84%
got psychological and
psychiatric symptomatology

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
if their brain is
hungry, if it's starved,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.264 align:middle line:90%
or if it's poisoned.

00:43:45.264 --> 00:43:46.680 align:middle line:10%
There's a fact of
life in medicine

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:10%
that if I take your
bone and measure it,

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:10%
you got 5,000 times
more lead in it

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:10%
than you would have been if you
had been an Egyptian Pharaoh.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
If I take some fat
samples, you've

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.490 align:middle line:84%
still got DDT, DDE, and
DDD in your fat samples

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:84%
even though DDT has been
banned a long time ago as well

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:84%
as a whole range
of other chemicals.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.333 align:middle line:84%
But does anybody want
to hear about that?

00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:12.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>And that has not
yet registered.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if it has, doctors
simply refuse to do it.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
they do is toxic.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Every drug they use--
prescription drugs,

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.670 align:middle line:84%
over the counter drugs, all
drugs are liver toxic bar none.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:10%
>>Something like 79
million Americans

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:10%
are getting mercury fillings
put in their mouths every day

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.309 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:10%
Legally, we're not supposed
to say they're toxic,

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.350 align:middle line:10%
so I never mention
that to patients.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But for a documentary, are they?

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:90%
You betcha.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>If I look at your brain
and do a brain biopsy,

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll find a large amount
of mercury in your system

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:84%
if you've had amalgam
fillings put in your mouth.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What makes amalgam or
mercury so much safer

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.350 align:middle line:84%
when you put it into
a tooth compared

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.330 align:middle line:84%
to when it's sitting
on a dentist's tray?

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.240 align:middle line:90%
It's highly toxic.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And the dentist has
to handle it as one

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of the most toxic
substances known to man.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's made safe when it's
put into your tooth, which

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.370 align:middle line:90%
is nonsense.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Suffice it to say that if
you have it in your mouth,

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.790 align:middle line:90%
you're being poisoned by it.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>These toxins, when you stop
pushing them into the system,

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.480 align:middle line:90%
start to come out.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you now
only change your diet

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
eating all organic,

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.900 align:middle line:84%
you are releasing
all these poisons.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:84%
They go into the bloodstream
and into the liver.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And unless you help the
liver get rid of it,

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.655 align:middle line:90%
you can cause new damage.

00:45:55.655 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a mistake.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a half a therapy.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The other half of the
therapy is detoxify.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>>Colonics, enemas, things
that help to move stuff out,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.130 align:middle line:10%
herbs that help to
move things out,

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:10%
water that helps to
move things out-- these

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:10%
are critical factors in
the cleansing equation

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:10%
because our body's primary
method of cleansing

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:21.670 align:middle line:10%
and detoxification is
through the bowels.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>We have to get the
toxins out to even allow

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.178 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients to get
into the tissues.

00:46:27.178 --> 00:46:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't get them in there
if they're full of poisons.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't get two
things into one space.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>The basic idea is
you've got to start

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:84%
by doing the simplest thing
ever, which is upon rising,

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.940 align:middle line:90%
drink lots of water.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
As simple as that
is, it's amazing

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.070 align:middle line:90%
how few people actually do that.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Drink a liter, two
liters of water

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.420 align:middle line:84%
before you have any
food, before you

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.320 align:middle line:84%
have any coffee, before
whatever-- tea, whatever you

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.050 align:middle line:84%
start your morning
with, just drink water

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and then begin your day.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:84%
What we notice first
is initially boom,

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.270 align:middle line:90%
things flow out.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:middle line:84%
My cousin lost 150 pounds
in about an 18-month period

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.300 align:middle line:84%
on our program: raw,
organic natural foods

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.150 align:middle line:84%
across the selection that
we've been talking about.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:22.162 align:middle line:84%
And he actually moved all
that toxicity out of his body

00:47:22.162 --> 00:47:24.300 align:middle line:90%
through his bowels.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Twelve bowel movements a day.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:30.640 align:middle line:84%
One day he lost 15
pounds in one day.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:84%
That is really interesting,
but really difficult

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to talk about to
the general public.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.594 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
think of weight loss,

00:47:37.594 --> 00:47:40.010 align:middle line:84%
we think we're going to work
out and covert it into muscle

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and sweat it off, but
actually, in this day

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and age with the toxicity
that's in the average fat cell

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
of the average person, you don't
want to move that stuff out

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.210 align:middle line:90%
through your skin.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You want to get it out
through your bowels

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:52.765 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:47:52.765 --> 00:47:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>The big problem
with cancer research

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:02.596 align:middle line:84%
is that the public is led
to believe that the cancer

00:48:02.596 --> 00:48:04.220 align:middle line:84%
breakthrough is around
the next corner.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Look at any
newspaper most weeks,

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a story
in there: new cancer cure.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And yet, when you
stand back and look

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:10%
at what's actually happening,
your relatives continue to die.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:10%
My relatives continue to die.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.020 align:middle line:10%
The cancer
breakthrough turns out

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:10%
to be just another drug
that causes cancer.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Because most of these chemos
are themselves carcinogens.

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:23.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:90%
These are cell toxins.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.290 align:middle line:84%
They're designed to poison tumor
cells so they don't replicate.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So the big mistake
that's happening here

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the cancer
industry is continuing

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.110 align:middle line:84%
to view the tumor as
the cancer, and we

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
know the tumor is
not the cancer.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if the tumor
were the cancer,

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that would mean that we
could cut the tumors out

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.340 align:middle line:84%
of the human body and they
would never grow back.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.715 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
that's not true.

00:48:43.715 --> 00:48:45.920 align:middle line:84%
We know these tumors
can and do grow back.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they grow
back is you have not

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.160 align:middle line:84%
corrected the underlying
metabolic process.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:10%
>>Cancer is one of the most
deadly and elusive enemies

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:10%
ever faced by man.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.090 align:middle line:10%
Once cancerous cells
appear, they soon

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:10%
develop into a
clump of tissue that

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.120 align:middle line:10%
lives at the expense
of the entire body.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.760 align:middle line:84%
This tissue crowds
and robs nourishment

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:84%
from other cells,
tissues, or organs.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>>There's a lot of
people that are beginning

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:20.740 align:middle line:10%
to realize that conventional
medicine just does not work.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.790 align:middle line:10%
The AMA themselves
said that for cancer,

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:29.920 align:middle line:10%
specifically, independent of
the stage that the patient comes

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.120 align:middle line:10%
to the doctor's office, whether
it's stage one or four-- most

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.490 align:middle line:10%
cancers are divided
into four stages--

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.750 align:middle line:10%
independent of the stage that
the patient first arrives,

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:45.535 align:middle line:10%
less than 30% survive five
years using chemo, surgery,

00:49:45.535 --> 00:49:46.800 align:middle line:10%
or radiation.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That means that more
than 70% of them die.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.970 align:middle line:90%
That is just not acceptable.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.610 align:middle line:90%


00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>What chance do I
really have, Doctor?

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Mr. Marshall, I have
no desire to mislead you.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you realize that
recovery is not a sure thing.

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we can go through
surgery as quickly as possible,

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe you have a
good chance of recovery.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>We have the precedent
set by Dr. Max Gerson back

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s and '40s who showed
that vitamins, and especially

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.650 align:middle line:84%
large quantities
of fresh vegetable

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:32.150 align:middle line:84%
juices and organic foods,
would help to reverse cancer.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And Gerson had about
a 50% cure rate

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.660 align:middle line:90%
with terminally ill patients.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely high.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
With malignant melanoma, the
Gerson therapy is spectacular.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is enough reason
for every physician to learn

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.180 align:middle line:84%
about the Gerson
therapy, but they don't.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Medical school does not talk
about these alternatives.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Normal human body
has powerful defenses

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:47.980 align:middle line:10%
to the point where
cancer is impossible.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:10%
The human body has such
powerful defenses that a normal,

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:58.440 align:middle line:10%
healthy body cannot, will not
develop cancer or any other

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.040 align:middle line:10%
chronic disease for that matter.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but with a good,
healthy, normal, rich, organic

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
food, you can reverse
these diseases.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you want to reverse
cancer, what you've really

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.470 align:middle line:84%
got to do is get in there and
wreck the internal environment

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.161 align:middle line:84%
the cancer depends
upon to thrive.

00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's how these
clinics are doing it.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.370 align:middle line:84%
What they're not
doing is loading

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:84%
loads of chemotherapy and
radiation and toxicity

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.582 align:middle line:84%
into the body to create more
problems for the immune system,

00:52:27.582 --> 00:52:29.290 align:middle line:84%
which is already
weakened and vulnerable.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why the person
has got cancer.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And as G. Edward
Griffin says, if you

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.510 align:middle line:84%
want to give somebody cancer,
give them chemotherapy.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Because those chemotherapies
are themselves

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.930 align:middle line:90%
carcinogens most of the time.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.086 align:middle line:84%
I receive thousands
of phone calls a year,

00:52:43.086 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and not a few of
those are coming

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:84%
from people who went
through all the best

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.260 align:middle line:84%
medicine that hospitals
could give them,

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and the tumors
kept growing back.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they said, why do I
keep getting this cancer back,

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:90%
the doctor said, we don't know.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:59.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't really
know what causes cancer.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:01.062 align:middle line:90%
We've known for 60 years.

00:53:01.062 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've known
since Professor John

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Beard of Edinburgh University
wrote his thesis in 1904

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.350 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is a healing process
that hasn't switched off.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But you see, again,
it comes back

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.359 align:middle line:84%
to-- it's not that the drug
industry is selectively

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:15.900 align:middle line:84%
lying to people, they're just
not covering the issues the way

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.360 align:middle line:90%
they should be covering it.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.640 align:middle line:84%
A classic example
is the way they've

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:90%
manipulated the survival rates.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:24.190 align:middle line:84%
The word survive-- you'll hear
an advert which says, well,

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:26.030 align:middle line:84%
now we're-- give
to this charity,

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.300 align:middle line:84%
we are now seeing that 80%
of women are surviving breast

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.100 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done is
redefined the word "survive"

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to mean only five years
after initial treatment.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.200 align:middle line:90%
So take my aunt.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:90%
My aunt got cancer.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.410 align:middle line:84%
She is forever immortalized
as a cancer survivor

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.010 align:middle line:84%
because she survived
the five years,

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.400 align:middle line:90%
but she died six months later.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:90%
So she's cured and dead.

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>In 1972, our
then-president Nixon

00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:84%
stated that, if we throw enough
money at this cancer problem,

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.330 align:middle line:90%
we'll solve it.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:84%
We were able to put
a man on the moon,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and we ought to be able
to solve the problem.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Together, we can hardly fail.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:84%
For there is no force on Earth
to match the will and spirit

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.960 align:middle line:90%
of the people of America.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.948 align:middle line:90%


00:54:16.948 --> 00:54:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And in 1972, he agreed to
make a great deal of money

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:31.140 align:middle line:84%
That year, 220,000
Americans died of cancer.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Exactly 25 years later, USA
Today, the big newspaper--

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
also in Newsweek--

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
published the figures,
what actually did happen.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.580 align:middle line:84%
What happened was
the US government,

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:56.020 align:middle line:84%
us taxpayers, put out over $39
billion US dollars for research

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.410 align:middle line:90%
on cancer.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The result was 25
years later in 1996,

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:11.860 align:middle line:84%
560,000 people died of
cancer-- more than double.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>The five year or
better survival rate

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.020 align:middle line:84%
for almost all
forms of cancer is

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.990 align:middle line:84%
unchanged for the
last four decades.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty sad.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:26.870 align:middle line:10%
>>Cancer remains man's number
two killer, second only

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.260 align:middle line:10%
to heart disease.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Little wonder that a victim
of cancer like Mr. Marshall

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:90%
feels depressed.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, the thing
about a war-- and this

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is a cancer war-- wars
are only profitable when

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.490 align:middle line:90%
you're fighting them.

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's face it-- if
cancer disappeared

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.760 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, millions of people
would have to retrain.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a $200 billion
a year industry

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to have to
dismantle if the truth ever

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:51.800 align:middle line:84%
came out about what
we would need to do.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:90%


00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of people ask,
why am I in Mexico?

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.480 align:middle line:90%
That's precisely why.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm an American citizen.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I live in San Diego.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.970 align:middle line:90%
My kids went to school here.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I would love to be able to
do what I believe is correct.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And the country of my birth,
my patients, a lot of them

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:90%
come from the US.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They would like to be able to
do what is, in their opinion,

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:29.810 align:middle line:84%
a good program to cure
their disease problem.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.325 align:middle line:84%
And the countries
of their birth,

00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:32.825 align:middle line:84%
whether it be
Austrailia, whether it

00:56:32.825 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
be New Zealand, whether it
be Canada, England, the US,

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.580 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you can't get
the health care laws changed.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>The war against
cancer has been

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:48.220 align:middle line:84%
fought with one arm
behind the back.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
go into the ring

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.730 align:middle line:84%
with the heavyweight
champion of the world

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:52.980 align:middle line:90%
and fight with one arm.

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet by restricting
cancer research and cancer

00:56:56.140 --> 00:57:08.480 align:middle line:84%
treatment to basically drug,
surgery, radiation approaches

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and not considering
nutrition seriously,

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.249 align:middle line:84%
we've done a terrible
disservice to all these people.

00:57:13.249 --> 00:57:14.748 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's not that
people are lying.

00:57:14.748 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not that everybody who
works in the cancer industry

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is somehow an evil
and wicked person.

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.900 align:middle line:84%
What we look at here is we're
seeing that a lot of people

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:84%
are just doing what
they believe is best.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.785 align:middle line:84%
You can be sincere, and
you can be sincerely wrong.

00:57:27.785 --> 00:57:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And the good news is
we can change that today.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:33.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the few free
choices a person has

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:35.416 align:middle line:84%
is what they will
or will not eat.

00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>So we have to
make sure that we

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.830 align:middle line:84%
are looking at doing
everything possible to build

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.160 align:middle line:90%
the body up, not break it down.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That makes all the sense
in the world, doesn't it?

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>You should do everything
you possibly can

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and stack the deck
in your favor.

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And that means building the
immune system nutritionally

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and using vitamins to help
the body fight the disease.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Because being malnourished can't
possibly help you beat cancer.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.140 align:middle line:10%
>>In males, the digestive
tract is most frequently

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.024 align:middle line:10%
afflicted with cancer.

00:58:05.024 --> 00:58:06.690 align:middle line:10%
>>Colon cancer is a
good place to start,

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:08.670 align:middle line:10%
because it's not
very easy to treat.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Colon cancer is a
very serious disease.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that it's
100% preventable by having

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
a high fiber diet
and avoiding things

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
aggravate cancer,

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:25.280 align:middle line:84%
such as certain additives,
food preservatives,

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.700 align:middle line:90%
environmental chemicals.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:31.220 align:middle line:84%
They could be a cause of
any number of cancers.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The Japanese who
live in Japan and eat

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the standard Japanese
diet and live

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the standard Japanese lifestyle
have the lowest incidence

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.340 align:middle line:90%
of cancer in the world.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's believed
that the low incidence

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is due to the high intake of
seafood, including fish and sea

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.780 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.620 align:middle line:84%
With that diet, there
is a high intake

00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:58.270 align:middle line:84%
of trace elements like selenium,
and zinc, and germanium,

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and a whole range of other
anti-cancer trace elements.

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:05.930 align:middle line:84%
There's also high intake
of the omega 3 fish oils,

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.751 align:middle line:84%
which are protective as well,
not only for cancers but heart

00:59:08.751 --> 00:59:09.750 align:middle line:90%
disease and Alzheimer's.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And they also drink green tea.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And green tea has got
a range of chemicals

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that protect us against cancer
as well, protect our cells

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and our genes and so on.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>In the female, cancers of
the breast and the uterus

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.940 align:middle line:90%
are the most prevalent.

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>You take a Japanese
woman from Japan,

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:33.840 align:middle line:84%
where the incidence of
breast cancer is very low,

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and transplant her into America,
and she changes her lifestyle,

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the incidence of cancer
then starts creeping up

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to that of the American woman,
which is around about 13% now.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So 13% of females in America
will get cancer of the breast.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Japanese are less than 1%.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.970 align:middle line:10%
>>We doctors are
improving our techniques.

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:03.050 align:middle line:10%
No individual is alone in
the fight against cancer.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Research workers are finding and
reporting more and more facts.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.657 align:middle line:90%
We will conquer cancer.

01:00:09.657 --> 01:00:12.520 align:middle line:90%


01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>>When we look at high doses of
vitamin C given intravenously

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:19.510 align:middle line:10%
as an actual
chemotherapeutic agent,

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.600 align:middle line:10%
we have wonderful,
uplifting news

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.480 align:middle line:10%
for every cancer
patient in the world.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy and
safe-- and did I

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
say inexpensive-- to have
a physician give an IV.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
You just have to insist on it.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the next 10 years,
this will become more accepted.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But people with cancer
can't afford to wait.

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
already did have

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
been grossly mistreated
by the medical profession

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and by the government that
supposedly is supposed

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
to encourage free
research and development

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.820 align:middle line:90%
of all possibilities.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you come along and
say, instead of treating cancer

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.927 align:middle line:84%
with chemotherapy, you can give
intravenous vitamin C, 30, 60,

01:01:01.927 --> 01:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
100,000 milligrams a day
directly into the bloodstream,

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and that will kill cancer cells.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C at that high
dose is selectively

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.050 align:middle line:90%
toxic to cancer cells.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what chemotherapy is.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But with vitamin C, there's
no damage to healthy cells.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.700 align:middle line:90%
And people don't get nauseous.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't lose their hair.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:25.860 align:middle line:90%
All they do is get better.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.210 align:middle line:10%
>>We pushed the dose up
to 40,000 milligrams,

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:31.220 align:middle line:10%
50,000 milligrams,
60,000 milligrams.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:35.370 align:middle line:10%
We pushed the dose up
to 100,000 milligrams.

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.540 align:middle line:84%
We even went to
200,000 milligrams.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And we nearly got to a quarter
of a kilo IV in 24 hours.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
No adverse events, no adverse
side effects apart from thirst

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and feeling a bit
woozy in the head.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
That's with huge amounts of
vitamin C, the substances that

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
were meant to cause
kidney stones if you

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
took 100 milligrams.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, we wonder, why
isn't this being done?

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the next assumption
is, if this were so good,

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
my doctor would
already know about it.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.250 align:middle line:10%
If this were so good, it
would be on television.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.420 align:middle line:10%
If this were so good, it would
be taught in medical school.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one
of those assumptions.

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want to
teach about vitamins

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
in medical school?

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Why would medical doctors who
studied medicine and practiced

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
medicine and are heavily funded
by pharmaceutical companies,

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
why would they go and
look into vitamins?

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical companies are
not going to advocate vitamins.

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
The government
doesn't know anything

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't told by the
pharmaceutical companies

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and other lobbies, and
by medical lobbies.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The people don't know, because
they had an education that

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
never had the word
orthomolecular in it.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hugh Riordan said
that orthomolecular,

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
which is therapeutic nutrition,
orthomolecular medicine,

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.300 align:middle line:84%
is not the answer to
any question posed

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
in medical school.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So what you're set here
with is two divergent views

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
on health care.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.305 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you
have that, you have

01:03:11.305 --> 01:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
what we are experiencing
today: an impossible dichotomy.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to people
about using high dose vitamin

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.650 align:middle line:84%
C for cancer, and
then you tell them

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's been
heavily tested-- even

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the National
Institutes of Health

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
are showing that
this is working.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Riordan's team has been
doing this for 25 years or more

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.830 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I've seen for 30 years
that high doses of vitamins

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
greatly improve a cancer
patient's quality of life

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and greatly improve a cancer
patient's length of life.

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's many, many places
in the literature where

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you can look and find support
for high dose nutrient therapy

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to arrest or even
reverse cancer.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an impossible question.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it being done?

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, of course, is
until enough people complain,

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
it won't be done.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But if everyone demands
nutritional therapy,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.690 align:middle line:90%
it will change.

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:13.892 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if you want
nutritional therapy

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and you go to your
doctor and ask for it,

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like ordering chow
mein in a French restaurant.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the menu, and they
don't know how to make it.

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And you're not going to get it.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>You have a right to
self care and self help.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And we need to, again, teach
the regulators, the politicians,

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
the doctors, and get to the
universities and the people

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
training in medicine
to understand

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are plants with
anti-cancer properties.

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
There are plans with anti-nausea
and anti-vomiting properties.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
There are plants that
will help with rashes.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
There are plants that will help
with headaches and tiredness

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
that occur as a result
of chemotherapy.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.300 align:middle line:10%
>>Mom, listen.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.000 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm sure that those
government people

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.304 align:middle line:10%
are experts at their work.

01:05:01.304 --> 01:05:03.470 align:middle line:10%
But ever since I've been
taking Mr. Ka'humana's tea,

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.380 align:middle line:10%
I've felt simply wonderful.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Why, I never knew that a
remedy could be so effective.

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Why, I haven't been having
my usual attacks at all.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.905 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is that if it isn't
because of Mr. Ka'humana's tea?

01:05:13.905 --> 01:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%


01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>What if they gave everyone in
America free health insurance

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:24.150 align:middle line:90%
and no one needed it.

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of debate over how
we should finance and change,

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
provide health care to
everyone in the United States.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Most civilized countries
do have a national program

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
of health care
guaranteeing health

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.030 align:middle line:90%
care for pretty much everybody.

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
United States is
conspicuously absent.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
We have 30, maybe
40 million people

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that are uninsured
in the United States.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.370 align:middle line:84%
That's getting some attention,
as it rightly should.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But is the solution
to simply give them

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
access to a system that
doesn't work very well?

01:05:54.390 --> 01:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Or would it be a good idea to
teach them how to be healthy?

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I think they need education
and not medication.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>People need to be made
aware of the great benefit

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of improving their health
if they've got a cancer

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
or whatever disease
that they've got.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>We are at a stage
now where there's

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
a major change in what's
happening with medicine, which

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is that medicine no longer has
a lock on all the information.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.860 align:middle line:90%
The internet has changed that.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And as more and more
and more of our population

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:34.795 align:middle line:84%
start taking their health
into their own hands,

01:06:34.795 --> 01:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be even
more and more of a change.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It can't go on the way it is.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The system right now
is falling apart.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>We must make nutrition the
primary prevention strategy

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:47.740 align:middle line:90%
for the population.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have as
zealous on nutrition

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
as we are, apparently,
on global warming.

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
What we need to be able to
do is to persuade the public

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that you are what you eat,
food can change your mood,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that you are everything you
have ever done to yourself,

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and the choices
you make directly

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
affect the outcome of your life.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And it might be easy
enough to forget that

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
right now when you're 21 years
old and very fit and healthy

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.880 align:middle line:90%
eating badly.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But it all looks a
lot different when

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
you get into your
40s, 50s, and 60s

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.974 align:middle line:84%
and start to go down with a
serious degenerative illness.

01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>We've still got a
health system which really

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is a disease care
system and-- dominated

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
by doctors, and
hospitals, pathologists,

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and pharmacologists.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of a system is
going to look after itself.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It wants more work, and
it's truly not interested

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in reducing the amount
of illness and disease.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The more work they get,
the more profit there is.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
the medical industry.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And it does need to be there.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very important.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>The medical industry does
get a lot of things right.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Infant survivability
at birth, brilliant.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.649 align:middle line:90%
ANE trauma medicine, brilliant.

01:07:52.649 --> 01:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
God forbid you get
smashed up on a motorway

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and they have to put
you back together again.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:57.880 align:middle line:90%
They're very good at doing that.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Disease, pathetic.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The medical
profession has it wrong.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Even the medical schools
that offer nutrition

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
do not offer megadose nutrition.

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Even the medical
schools that have

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
courses in alternative medicine
are not really focusing on it.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
just giving it a nod.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.827 align:middle line:84%
The answer is for
every person to realize

01:08:23.827 --> 01:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that if you want
something done right,

01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:27.200 align:middle line:90%
you have to do it yourself.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.029 align:middle line:90%
You have to read.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to dig.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.779 align:middle line:84%
You have to want to
have this information.

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
might add, you have

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to actually
take the vitamins

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and actually juice
the vegetables.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to walk the walk.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>And anybody who's
watching this right now

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
has, at some level,
made a choice

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
do something that

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is going to improve their
lives, their family's

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
lives, their kids' lives, and
the life of the planet itself,

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and the life of all the
plants and everything.

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
If that is our choice,
then our food choices

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:03.649 align:middle line:90%
must correlate with that.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've
ever flown in a plane

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and you look out the
window of the plane

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and you see what's down
there, you see it's all farms.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.529 align:middle line:84%
The primary way that we're
interacting with our planet

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:15.170 align:middle line:90%
is through agriculture.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we change our food
choices, we change agriculture.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, we
shift away from, for example,

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:29.560 align:middle line:10%
corn, wheat, soy diets
over to superfood diets

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.399 align:middle line:10%
and organic diets
and raw food diets,

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:36.160 align:middle line:10%
and we shift the whole
way that we literally

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.979 align:middle line:10%
interact with the planet.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
we're doing on this planet

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.960 align:middle line:90%
is growing things.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
In spite of all the
chemical controlled,

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
giant agricultural businesses,
we're still growing stuff.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.109 align:middle line:84%
We could grow genetically
modified corn,

01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
or we could grow the most
extraordinary goji berries

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.020 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a lot more
turning to alternatives.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Because what's being done
beforehand doesn't work.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>When I look at
cancer rates going up,

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
heart disease going
up, stroke going up,

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's and senile dementia
and cognitive impairment

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.700 align:middle line:90%
going up-- a change is due.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the old
ways aren't working.

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do is
we need a fresh paradigm,

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.915 align:middle line:84%
and we need to go
back to basics.

01:10:21.915 --> 01:10:23.612 align:middle line:84%
And basics is all
about going back

01:10:23.612 --> 01:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
to look at these
cultures who don't

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
get these problems
in the same way

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to
be a millionaire,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.765 align:middle line:90%
go talk to a millionaire.

01:10:29.765 --> 01:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't talk to the guy down
the pub still recovering

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
from the last
golden opportunity.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Go find these people who are
living 100 years routinely

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
without cancer, heart
disease, and see

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.541 align:middle line:84%
if you can figure out
how they're doing it.

01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And we've done that work.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
We've done that science.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It's been done over
the last 100 years,

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's been
completely ignored.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>The very first course I
ever taught was in 1976,

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was called Forgotten
Research In Medicine.

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.776 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing the same
thing to this day.

01:10:55.776 --> 01:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%


01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel very
strongly that the best

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.620 align:middle line:84%
doctor in the world, the best
nutritionist in the world,

01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
is you.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
everything inside you,

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
all the equipment
necessary, to feel

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
if something is
right for you or not.

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>The good news is that people
are not a bunch of dummies.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln expressed
that when he said,

01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
you can fool some of the
people all of the time and all

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
of the people some
of the time, but you

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
can't fool all of the
people all of the time.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why over
half of the population

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
now takes vitamins even
though most doctors would

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.240 align:middle line:84%
say that it's really
not necessary.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a public that's
catching on quicker

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
than the medical professions.

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
In a way, it's sad.

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
But in a way, it's great.

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
People should stop
being patients

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and start being people.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Why not be healthy and happy?

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.435 align:middle line:90%
You change your life.

01:11:59.435 --> 01:12:00.310 align:middle line:90%
You do some exercise.

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
You eat right.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:02.235 align:middle line:90%
You feel better.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.359 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

01:12:03.359 --> 01:12:04.025 align:middle line:90%
You look better.

01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:05.380 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's good.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.230 align:middle line:90%
You live longer.

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:07.010 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.950 align:middle line:90%
You save money.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
enormous satisfaction

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.040 align:middle line:90%
of having done it yourself.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
People think, I don't
have a medical education.

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't know this.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, please.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
How complicated is it to eat
right and drink vegetable

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.080 align:middle line:90%
juices and exercise?

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't need any
degree to know that.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It's too simple to work.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:32.740 align:middle line:90%
It's safe.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It's effective.

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The biggest single reason
why people aren't doing this

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is that it requires
taking responsibility.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And that is the only way out.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>When we choose raw,
organic, plant-based foods,

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we take our power
back and we decide

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that we are going
to have quality,

01:12:55.890 --> 01:13:00.347 align:middle line:84%
and that we are not going
to suffer from some 50

01:13:00.347 --> 01:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
ingredients that are in there
of chemicals we never even

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.940 align:middle line:90%
heard of before.

I am not a big advocate
of preaching vegetarianism

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
to everybody or veganism
or even raw food-ism.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But we do know for
a fact that an 80%

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
raw, organic,
plant-based diet that

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
covers all the different facets
of fruits, vegetables, nuts,

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
seeds, seaweed, sprouts,
grasses, superfoods, and herbs

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is a massively valuable part
of a healthy and wonderfully

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.350 align:middle line:90%
abundant lifestyle.

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:36.970 align:middle line:90%

There is no monotherapy that
cures cancer, that cures

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.200 align:middle line:90%
heart disease.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lifestyle
change that prevents, arrests,

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and reverses serious
chronic disease.

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>The solutions are here.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
They've always been here.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's left
is just the education.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:58.633 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm convinced
that once people

01:13:58.633 --> 01:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
know what the solution
is, they'll act on it.

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:04.556 align:middle line:84%
They will decide,
yep, we're doing it.
