00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's a business.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was
supposed to be a consultant,

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
consultants in people's
spiritual development,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:90%
not in earthly welfare.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> While they accept
the reality of oracles,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
a large number of educated lay
Tibetans feel some ambivalence

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:84%
about their use in
the modern world.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But there is a small
minority, those

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
who want complete
independence for Tibet

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than the Dalai Lama's
middle path approach, who

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
are critical of
the use of oracles,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:84%
especially for making
political decisions.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:10%
>> In a democratic society,
the elected people have

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:10%
the responsibility to make
decisions and to be responsible

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:10%
for their country, put the blame
on some non-existent, nameless,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and formless being.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in old Tibet, a lot
of the oracles faced not only

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.130 align:middle line:90%
doubt but criticism.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Though he used to live here
in Dharamsala, the essayist,

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and novelist Jamyang Norbu has
moved with his family to rural

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Tennessee.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in public, the Tibetan
national oracle has been booed

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:90%
in public.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.150 align:middle line:10%
After he-- yeah, he
predicted wrongly

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.010 align:middle line:10%
about the British invasion,
the [INAUDIBLE] invasion.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's 700 Tibetans
in one day were massacred.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:10%
He said that the Tibetans
are not to worry,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:10%
that the heavenly armies
would back up the militia

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.452 align:middle line:10%
and that he would be there
to lead the heavenly armies.

00:36:03.452 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know, it
was just massive carnage.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:90%
They had Gatling guns.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And 700 Tibetan militia
were just slaughtered.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:16.212 align:middle line:84%
And people avoid responsibility
by asking the oracle.

00:36:16.212 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:84%
If you invoke the
oracle, then, you

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:90%
know, your hands, it's clean.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say that.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:90%
The oracle made the decision.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Oracles are also misused in
other ways than for avoiding

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:90%
responsibility and earthly gain.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Their spirits are
sometimes propitiated

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:84%
as enlightened deities,
worthy of going to

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual refuge.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> These are mundane
sort of spirit.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So should not consider
them as a refuge.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, due
to lack of knowledge

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:55.240 align:middle line:84%
about Buddha Dharma, then
sometimes, the people

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.820 align:middle line:90%
do some of--

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
absolute sort of protector,
something like that,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.400 align:middle line:90%
ultimate protector.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Consider it or treated
them almost like a Buddha.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:90%
That's totally wrong.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.966 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:11.380 align:middle line:90%
How do you say?

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.395 align:middle line:90%
Feeding birds, feeding place.

00:37:13.395 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Then the second, protection.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's lot of small birds,
you see, together.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Then-- what do you call-- hawk
sometimes, you see, they come.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.437 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one
way of protection.

00:37:29.437 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The issue of improper use
of oracles reached a head

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
in the 1990s, with a seething
controversy that culminated

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in a horrible ritual murder.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
The beginnings of
the Shugden Oracle

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
are murky, going back
at least 350 years

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to the time of the
Fifth Dalai Lama.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:84%
What is clear is that at
the end of the last century,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.620 align:middle line:84%
an influential high lama
elevated this relatively minor

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.410 align:middle line:84%
oracle to be the chief
protector of the Gelug

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.950 align:middle line:84%
school, the Dalai Lama's own
branch of Tibetan Buddhism.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Despite the warnings of
the previous Dalai Lama,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.440 align:middle line:84%
many of the Gelugs began
to propitiate this spirit

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:90%
as fully enlightened.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The problems intensified
when the oracle proclaimed

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that the Gelugs should
not do any practices

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:90%
of the other three schools.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:84%
This led to sectarian rifts and
concerns by the other schools

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that the already
powerful Gelugs were

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:84%
using this oracle for political,
not spiritual advancement.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The present Dalai Lama, as the
political head of all Tibetans,

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
has always been
strictly nonsectarian

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and has therefore
practiced teachings

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:90%
from all four schools.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The Shugden Oracle's
insistence on doctrinal purity,

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
if not a personal attack
on him, was certainly

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
a thorn in the side of his
policy of nonsectarianism.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, it is a
fundamentalist, Gelugpa oracle.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:10%
And the Dalai Lama
necessarily had

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.120 align:middle line:10%
to say, if you are closely
associated with that oracle,

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:10%
you can't be closely
associated with me

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:17.040 align:middle line:10%
because my constituency isn't
limited just to one sect.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dalai Lama's
response was very direct.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He stated that the
practice of Shugden

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
was a form of spirit worship and
was harmful to the Dalai Lama

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:90%
institution and Tibetan unity.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:84%
While he could not tell
anyone not to practice it,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:84%
he would ask
practitioners of Shugden

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:90%
not to attend his teachings.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.930 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:84%
This request shook the Gelug
sect to its foundations.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Large numbers of the high
lamas were Shugden devotees.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And the practice was
even well-established

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:90%
among Western students.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:84%
A profound choice
had to be made.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.390 align:middle line:10%
A Western friend of mine
wrote me, "Even today, I

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.180 align:middle line:10%
find it hard to talk about,
though I don't feel especially

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:10%
connected anymore.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:90%
But it went very deep.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
stopping is very complex.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:90%
The spirit has a firm hold.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's akin to the feelings
held by cult followers

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:90%
when trying to separate.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Huge guilt stuff."

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.160 align:middle line:84%
While nearly all the Gelugs gave
up the practice, some did not.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And there were elements
in the Tibetan community

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.010 align:middle line:84%
who were overzealous in how they
dealt with those who refused.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.630 align:middle line:84%
This led to charges
of witch hunts.

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Things reached an
almost absurd plateau

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:84%
when the more radical
Shugden supporters

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
charged that the Dalai
Lama was trying to suppress

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.630 align:middle line:90%
their religious freedom.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:84%
As far from the truth
as this was, it did

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:84%
illustrate the
extremely dangerous mood

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:90%
that was brewing.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
On a night in February
1997, the head

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Institute of
Buddhist Dialectics

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and an outspoken critic of
the extremes of the Shugden

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
supporters was followed back
to Dharamsala from Delhi

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and ritually murdered, along
with two young assistants.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> He was a really close
friend and a teacher.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But the way of
death, so unpleasant.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen murder.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.921 align:middle line:84%
You know, murder is a
part of the human life.

00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But people sort of digging
knives in other people,

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and cutting their
throat, and stabbing them

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
all over the place-- and the
young boys who died with him.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Dalai Lama
said, you can't feel sorry

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.780 align:middle line:84%
for a man who's had
a wonderful life.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You feel sorry for the
man who killed him.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really do
feel sorry for them.

00:41:30.695 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel
sorry for somebody

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.153 align:middle line:90%
who had an excellent life.

00:41:33.153 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But the young boys who
died with him, terrible.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indian police believe
the perpetrators escaped

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.650 align:middle line:84%
into Chinese Tibet, where
they apparently remain beyond

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the reach of Indian law.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It's common belief here that
they were supported and funded

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
by the Chinese Secret
Service to create disunity

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
among the Tibetan
community in exile.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Though the Dalai Lama agrees
that oracles have often

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:10%
been misused, he feels
that to stop their use

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.420 align:middle line:10%
would mean abandoning a
unique part of Tibetan culture

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:10%
and would not be in keeping
with the Buddhist middle way.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Religion also
sometimes misused.

00:42:21.645 --> 00:42:23.145 align:middle line:84%
Does, I think, a
little bit extreme.

00:42:23.145 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:84%
If you entirely relying
on oracle, extreme.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
