00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:40.677 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
From his father

He is fixing happiness.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And why is God doing that?

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:07.745 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So that people and
nations can go up and down.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So your family wants

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:20.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Yes, but I am

Then, study medicine as well.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:26.652 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
A spirit crept into him during
the night and brought him here.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
He is evil.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Now he can't do any more harm.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.707 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:16.178 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%

How shall I put it?

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.358 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Some people say we
have a soul that

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.194 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
goes on living when we are
dead, but I don't believe this.

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:42.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And yet, I'm certain
beyond all doubt

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:46.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that through certain
experiences we

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:52.798 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
can develop a very fine
substance in ourselves.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When we die, this substance
does not die at the same time,

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.807 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
but much later.

studies, and in two years

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:46.722 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I'll be ordained as a priest.

Is that what you want?

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%

00:21:54.396 --> 00:22:01.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%

a priest-- I don't know.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
My father says if you
want to lose your faith,

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.951 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
make friends with a priest.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.961 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Nothing convinces me, either.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:26.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%

00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:37.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
I have a letter for you.

00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:38.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
My friend is very ill.

00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:39.815 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Bring him in.

00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:41.233 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
You are very welcome.

00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:55.622 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
I have lived here all my life.

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:57.541 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
There has never been
a school like the one

00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:59.668 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
you described-- not here.

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:07.759 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
What did you say it was called?

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.094 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
Sarmoung?

00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:20.147 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
A year before last, a
man quite unknown to me

00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
came and asked me to show
him a map I possess.

00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:37.956 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
How could he have
known I had it?

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.166 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
I have no idea.

00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:41.668 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I inherited it from
my grandfather.

00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The man was so persistent.

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.297 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I thought why shouldn't
I let him see it.

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:48.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He looked at the parchment
and immediately offered

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:52.179 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
me 200 Turkish pounds for it.

00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You might like to
take a look at it.

00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:06.568 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt;[GURDJIEFF] Sarmoung.

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:10.488 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
&gt;&gt;[PRIEST] He said it was a map
of Egypt before the sands.

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:13.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I didn't wish to
part with it anyway.

00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I didn't need the
money, so I refused.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.791 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The next day, he came
to offer 500 pounds.

00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:25.587 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Now, I was tempted,
but this proved to me

00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:27.422 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
it must be very valuable.

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:32.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It must not be let go too
cheaply, so I refused again.

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:37.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
He then explained to me he was
a Russian prince who needed it

00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:41.728 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
for his collection of antiques,
and if I wouldn't part with it,

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:45.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
would I let him make a
copy of it for 200 pounds.

00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:54.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Just think-- 200 pounds
for a copy of a parchment.

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
He's gone.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
We must go to Egypt.

00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Don't worry.
We'll pay the price.

[non-English speech]

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:20.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
You.

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:22.245 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Help me with these.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Of course.

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:30.962 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Hey, gravedigger!

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Prince Lubovedsky.

00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:35.967 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Are you still
collecting the dust

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of people who died long ago?

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Why not?
At least it's real.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Not imaginary like
your life's work.

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.675 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Where did you get that?

00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:24.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Are you the man who gave 200
pounds to an Armenian priest

00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:27.102 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
to copy this map?

00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:30.230 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Yes, I am that man.

00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:36.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
We need to speak to one another.

00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:47.497 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
[piano music]

00:37:10.103 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Since I was a child,
I had the feeling

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that something is missing in me.

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I felt that apart
from my ordinary life,

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:26.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there is another life... a
life which is calling me.

00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:29.205 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
But how to be open to it?

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:32.584 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
This question never
gives me any peace,

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:37.088 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and I've become like a
hungry dog chasing everywhere

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
for an answer.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.092 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You should be happy
you've had that experience.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
When I was your age, I was
only interested in myself.

00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was always concerned with
satisfying my needs and those

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.275 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
of my family.

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:04.449 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Suddenly, my wife
died in childbirth.

00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:08.369 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I could not recover
from the shock.

00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Life had no meaning anymore.

00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:21.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
One day, an old dervish came
to the house and asked for me.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:30.517 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We talked together for a
long time, and as he spoke,

00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:33.228 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I experienced
something far greater

00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:36.314 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
than all the impulses
I normally obeyed.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:43.905 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When the dervish left me,
the experience vanished,

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:47.116 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
but I knew what I
was looking for.

00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:48.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
For that, help was needed.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:58.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Fortunately, I had
the means to travel.

00:38:58.253 --> 00:39:04.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I went to Africa, India,
Afghanistan, and Persia.

00:39:04.217 --> 00:39:06.594 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I organized special
expeditions to places

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:09.347 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
where I thought I
might find an answer.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I lived in monasteries
and met many people

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
with interests
similar to my own.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.857 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
How can I meet such people?

00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:21.734 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
I need to know.

00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:24.112 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
What do you need to know?

00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:25.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
I want to learn.

00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:27.699 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I want to understand.

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:28.992 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Be careful.

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:35.915 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What do you call learning-- if
it means storing up experiences

00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and beliefs, it will
tie you like a cord

00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:40.295 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and prevent you from knowing.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.881 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Knowing happens directly.

00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:51.472 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Where not even a thought stands
between you and the thing

00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:52.724 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
you know.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:58.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then you see
yourself as you are,

00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
not as you would like to be.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.909 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I have learned how
difficult this can be.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.584 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Dear, young friend.

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:23.796 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I will do everything I can
to help you attain your aim.

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:53.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is the dervish,
Bogga-Eddin.

00:41:26.526 --> 00:41:28.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You wish to ask something?

00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:35.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What exercise can help me
feel myself in a new way?

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.669 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I have been in
Upper Bukhara where

00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:47.505 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I met a most interesting man.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
We came here together.

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:54.846 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This old man is a
member of a brotherhood

00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.723 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
from the heart of Asia.

00:41:56.723 --> 00:42:00.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He's living not far from here.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.602 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Go and see him.

00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:05.148 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Talk with him about the
questions which interest you.

00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:08.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This may help you to
become clear about what

00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:10.528 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
it is you seek.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:28.045 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
[music playing, chanting]

00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:42.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[indistinct talking]

00:43:17.136 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
One can think well here.

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
You are Russian?

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Yes.

00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:28.981 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I am glad to speak
to someone from Russia.

00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:29.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I have been in Russia.

00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:31.108 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
Ah.

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But that is not the point.

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:41.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Hey, Gogo.

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:47.917 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Gogo.

00:43:47.917 --> 00:43:51.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
How do you know that name?

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:54.257 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Only my mother and my
nurse ever called me by it,

00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:56.634 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and that was over 40 years ago.

00:43:57.677 --> 00:44:06.269 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Gogo, you have worked and
suffered all these years

00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.980 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
but you never knew how to work.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.898 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
How to let the
desire of your mind

00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:13.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
become the desire of your heart.

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
Who are you?

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.862 align:middle line:85% position:35% size:0%


00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:18.614 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt;[PROFESSOR SKRIDLOV] How do
you know me so well?

00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:24.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Does it really matter
who I am or what I am?

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Isn't your curiosity
one of the chief reasons

00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:29.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
your life has come to nothing?

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:39.594 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Is it so strong that
even now all you want

00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:42.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is an explanation of who
I am and how I know you?

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Yes, father.

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:58.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
You are right.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have seen many miracles
and tried to explain them,

00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:08.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it has brought me
no real understanding.

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:14.211 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Yes, I'm empty.

00:45:15.046 --> 00:45:16.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
It's too late.

00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:28.225 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I do not truly want to
know what I just asked you.

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I sincerely beg your pardon.

00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:43.199 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Perhaps it is
not yet too late.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:49.038 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If you feel with all your being
that you really are empty,

00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:52.375 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
then I advise you
to try once more.

00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:57.505 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you agree to one
condition, I want to help you.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.805 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
The condition is
die, consciously,

00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:09.308 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to the life you
have led until now.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:12.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And go where I shall indicate.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[non-English speech]

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I am looking for the
dervish Bogga-Eddin.

00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:03.654 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
He has returned to Bukhara.

[yelling]

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.204 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
I owe them money.

00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:42.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I-- I have been a
cheat all my life.

00:48:46.507 --> 00:48:49.135 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I used to steal from my mother.

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I forged bank notes.

00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.979 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I'll try to help you.

00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:07.778 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Professor Skridlov!

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
This is my friend.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.407 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
Soloviev.

00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:16.579 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
The Prince has gone away.

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:17.705 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
I know.

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:19.874 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
What now?

00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At last, I am on the track
of something really important.

00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:31.218 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I have learned that under
the sands of the Gobi Desert,

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:35.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
villages and even entire
cities lie buried.

00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:38.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The information has been
handed down from father to son

00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:40.853 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
under the vow of secrecy.

00:49:40.853 --> 00:49:45.399 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think I can find the
site of an ancient library.

00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Can you imagine the
secret scroll that

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
might still be buried there?

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'm preparing an expedition.

00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:58.204 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Would you like to come?

00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:02.666 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
We need men we can trust.

00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:06.795 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I can bring some friends.

00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:11.634 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

[indistinct talking]

00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:03.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I didn't think you'd
reach us in time.

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.062 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Nor did we, nor did we.

00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.730 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
We had to cross the Amu Darya.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There were Afghan guards and
British soldiers everywhere.

00:51:08.983 --> 00:51:11.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So Yelov got hold of a
uniform of a British soldier

00:51:11.527 --> 00:51:13.988 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and passed himself off
as an officer from India.

[chuckling]

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.722 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
What are those poles?

00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:42.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
That is something I
have to learn about.

00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:44.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
There are many
dangers, but we've

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:46.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
found some
extraordinary solutions.

00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
They may save our lives.

00:52:44.453 --> 00:52:48.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[non-English speech]

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.172 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There's always a way of
keeping our thoughts alive.

00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.757 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I'm learning Tibetan.

Quickly!

00:55:21.068 --> 00:55:22.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
We are lost.

00:55:28.283 --> 00:55:29.826 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Look!

[rumbling]

00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:37.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Careful!

00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:39.169 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
They are dangerous!

[gunshot]

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:15.390 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I cannot ask you
to go any further.

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:59.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now, we must separate again
until one of us finds a way.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.664 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I must go to Bukhara.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I can't go back now.

00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:31.508 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Take me with you?

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:15.969 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
[instruments playing]

00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:42.329 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%

[non-English speech]

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
The dervish Bogga-Eddin?

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.974 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Is the dervish
Bogga-Eddin in Bukhara?

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:42.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Have you found what
you are looking for?

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:43.867 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
I have found nothing.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.622 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I don't know how to search.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.165 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
There's never any answer.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
What can I do now?

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
I'm desperate.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.888 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You will never find
the answer by yourself.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:08.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Alone, a man can do very little.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:13.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
His only hope is to find a
place where real knowledge has

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
been kept alive.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:22.197 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I advise you to try to find
the Sarmoung brotherhood.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Go up the Amu Darya.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Go towards Kafiristan.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It is a dangerous undertaking.

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You will be risking your life.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:43.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But at the right moment,
there will be a guide.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.393 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
Can I take my friend with me?

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:55.647 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I think you may if you
can vouch for his honor.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:03.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[chanting]

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:47.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
I think that you
are foreigners.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:50.118 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Please do not be alarmed.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:53.121 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I do not want to know who
you are or why you're here.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.123 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It would be pleasant for
me to talk with a European.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:33.161 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
My name is Father Giovanni.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:38.249 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Long ago, I was a
Christian missionary,

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:41.628 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
then accidentally
I came in contact

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.130 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with members of the
world brotherhood.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.801 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We were striving for what
I dreamed of all my life.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:52.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I was admitted to
their brotherhood.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:05:00.355 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Since then, I've never
wished to go anywhere else.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:05.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
You are welcome.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:51.364 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Father Giovanni,
how can you stay here

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.700 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
instead of returning to
Italy and giving the people

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.452 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
there something
of the faith which

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you are now inspiring in me?

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:04.752 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ah, Professor, you do not
understand mens' psyche as well

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
as you know archaeology.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:10.884 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Faith cannot be given to men.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.556 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Faith is not the
result of thinking.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:18.766 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It comes from direct knowledge.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:24.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
For example, if my
own brother were

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:27.901 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to entreat me to give him a
tenth part of my understanding,

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
I could not.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:33.656 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
As he has neither the knowledge
or the experience which

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.617 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I have acquired in my life.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:41.164 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This would be like wishing
to fill someone with bread

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.249 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
merely by looking at him.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt;[MONK] There is a law.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.131 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The quality of
what you understand

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:53.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
depends upon the quality
of the person speaking.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:07:00.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In our order, we have
two very old brethren.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:06.522 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The one is called Brother
Ahl, the other Brother Sez.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.485 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They constantly travel from one
monastery to another preaching

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:11.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
there.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.240 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Once or twice a year,
they come to us.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:22.247 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
This is always a
very great event.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:30.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
When Brother Sez speaks,
it is like the song

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:33.591 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of the birds in paradise.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:37.637 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Brother Ahl's speech has
almost the opposite effect.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:40.890 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
He speaks badly
and indistinctly.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.644 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The stronger the impression
made by Brother Sez,

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:48.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the quicker it evaporates
until there is nothing left.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Brother Ahl makes
almost no impression,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but what he says penetrates into
the heart and remains there.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:04.289 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
As we all came
to the conclusion

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:09.294 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the sermons of Brother Sez
came entirely from his mind,

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and acted only on our minds.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:17.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Whereas those of Brother Ahl
came directly from his being

01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:20.305 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and acted on our being.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:28.980 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Yes, Professor, thinking and
knowing are quite different.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
One must strive to know.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:38.531 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
This alone can lead
to our Lord God.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.663 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:16.235 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Father Giovanni has
consented to take me

01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:18.071 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
under his protection.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.448 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
I'm going to stay here.

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:25.995 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I have a feeling I have
nothing more to seek.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Your guide is waiting.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:51.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I must ask you to
take a solemn oath never

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:54.607 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to reveal to anyone the place
to which we will lead you.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:00.988 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%

[chanting]

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.620 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I thought I'd
lost you forever.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:28.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm happy that you got here
by yourself without my help.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.464 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It proves that during this
time you haven't been asleep.

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Are you ill?

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:42.014 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
It's nothing.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.354 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
Come with me.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:56.070 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[drums banging]

&gt;&gt;[MAN] Stop!

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Everyone in the monastery
learns the alphabet

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.702 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of these movements.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They are exactly like books.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.250 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We can read in them truths
placed there many thousands

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.418 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
of years ago.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.336 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
I understand.

&gt;&gt; [MAN] Affirming.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Denying.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:14.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Reconciling.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:18.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Affirming.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:23.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Denying.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Reconciling.

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:32.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Affirming.

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:38.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Denying.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Reconciling.

[music playing]

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What is the real meaning
of these movements?

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:51.597 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They tell us of two
qualities of energy

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:54.516 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
moving without interruption
through the body.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:59.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
As long as the dancer can keep
in balance these two energies,

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:04.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
he has a force that
nothing else can give.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:09.907 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[music playing]

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:09.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This morning, I was
called to the patriarch.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.280 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He told me that I have
only three years to live

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.325 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and advised me to spend
them in the Olman monastery

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:20.162 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on the northern slopes
of the Himalayas

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.498 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in order to accomplish what I
have dreamed of all my life.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
He said he would
arrange everything

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:29.254 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to make my stay
there productive.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I agreed to set out at once.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
Oh, God.

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.469 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Is it true?

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:37.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Yes.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.724 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There is no better
way to finish my life.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:43.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Perhaps I shall
be able to make up

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.812 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
for all the years
I lost senselessly.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.151 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
[ringing]

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:03.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
[chanting]

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.368 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
Listen.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You have now found
the conditions

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.708 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in which the desire
of your heart

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:32.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
can become the
reality of your being.

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:38.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Stay here until you
acquire a force in you

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:40.344 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that nothing can destroy.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.973 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Then you will need
to go back into life,

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:48.143 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and there, you will
measure yourself constantly

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:52.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with forces which will
show you your place.
