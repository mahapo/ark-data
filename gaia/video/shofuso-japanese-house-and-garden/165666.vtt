The house was designed by

originally designed to be

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:10%
displayed at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:10%
and was designed by an
architect named Yoshimura Junzo.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:10%
He traveled to a number
of sites in Japan,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:10%
and picked one
for the main model

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:10%
that he based his house on.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
That building was
the guest quarters

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Kojo-in Temple in Otsu,
just outside of Kyoto, Japan.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
He adapted it to make
it a little bit more

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
modern, a little more
interesting, and a little bit

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:90%
more accessible.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.902 align:middle line:84%
>> It was built in Nagoya,
reassembled in Manhattan,

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and then exhibited for a year
and a half in New York before

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
being disassembled and moved
to Philadelphia in 1957.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:10%
It was moved to the site of
a previous Japanese garden

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:10%
and structure, the
Buddhist Temple

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:10%
Gate, that had stood till 1955
until it burned to the ground.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
It's a shoin
centered house, which

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
means it's centered
around a desk,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.502 align:middle line:84%
and would have been
the home of a very

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:90%
wealthy and educated person.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>> A shoin is a place where
a visitor to the house,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:10%
or especially if
it was a scholar,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:10%
could sit on the floor, use
the desk as a writing space

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:10%
or a reading space, and that
would be made more convenient

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:10%
by the fact that it's lighted
by a window immediately behind

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:10%
the desk.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
That window could
be opened, or it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
can be closed off with white
paper screens called shoji.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
The shoji have a wooden frame.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Over the wooden
frame, they stretch

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:90%
a thin layer of mulberry paper.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That allows light to come in,
but it keeps the wind out.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And it also evens
out the light, so

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't give
you the harsh shadows

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that direct sunlight might.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy
light to read by,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
or to simply spend your time in.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
The entrance to the house
compound is through a gate.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
The gate is in a
wall that's designed

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
to reflect castle
walls in Japan,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or the walls around Buddhist
temples, a masonry wall covered

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
with a flat white stucco
that then has a small tile

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
roof on top of it.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
That wall can be
really beautiful

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
when the shadows of trees,
branches, fall on it,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
or when the light
plays across it

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:90%
at different times of the day.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:55.159 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the distinctive
architectural features

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of Shofuso are the
sliding panel doors,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
which are actually walls.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:10%
The entire building
is surrounded

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.065 align:middle line:10%
on the exterior and the
interior with sliding panels

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:10%
that are either wood on the
exterior, which are the amado,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:10%
and protect the house from the
elements, or on the interior,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:10%
there are paper doors,
either thin paper doors that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:10%
allow light through, called
shoji, on the exterior,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:10%
or paper panels that
slide to enclose rooms,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:10%
and they're fusuma.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:10%
All the panels can be removed
for indoor-outdoor living

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to expand the spaces and to
shrink the spaces as they

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:10%
would have been needed.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Artist Hiroshi Senju,
who is internationally

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
renowned for his
abstract paintings,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
created a series of fusuma
murals entitled "Waterfall"

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:90%
for our interior.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the only installation
of its kind outside of Japan

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
and represents our waterfalls.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Senju saw the house
and donated these murals,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
which represent
waterfalls, to the house.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Waterfalls are an
important symbolic addition

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to the house because the water
is designed to symbolically

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
protect the house from
probably its worst

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:90%
enemy in the world, fire.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Senju also takes that
theme and plays it out

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
a little bit differently
on each wall,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
with abstract
sheets of water that

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
appear to flow down the wall,
painted with a pigment that

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
picks up the light
and reflects it back

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
at you in different ways,
depending on the time of day

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.565 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of
light in the room.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Shofuso is at the site of the
first Japanese garden in North

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It was built by the Japanese
government for the 1876

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Centennial Exposition.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:10%
Shofuso's gardens were designed
by landscape architect Tansai

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Sano, and incorporate three
different types of gardens

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:10%
onto our grounds.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
We have a pond and hill garden
out in front of the house.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.829 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:84%
We have a tea garden that
surrounds our teahouse.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And we have a small
courtyard garden,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
which is enclosed by the
rest of the building.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The central design idea for
the garden around the Japanese

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
house is that it fits
in with the house,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and makes an integrated whole.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
When you sit in the
main space, the space

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
seems to flow out from
the house, to the veranda,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.954 align:middle line:84%
to the near part of the garden,
to the middle of the garden,

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and to the far
part of the garden,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
in a very seamless kind
of flow that gives you

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
a sense that the
house and the garden

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
are really integrated and
intimately tied to one another.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Part of this comes
from the philosophy

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of how nature is actually viewed
in Asia, as opposed to the way

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:90%
it's viewed in the West.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we build our houses
to keep the natural world out.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
We make strong, solid walls.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We open them up with only
small windows and doors

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
so that we can close
everything out.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, the natural
world is invited in.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:10%
The seasons are enjoyed
as a natural phenomenon

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:10%
that everyone appreciates.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
The garden is designed
in the same way,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
so that the space of the house
and the space of the garden,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
while separate, are very much in
conversation with one another.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:10%
It allows the viewer to see
both mountains and water--

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:10%
that is to say, the hills
of the garden that are

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:10%
made to look like mountains--

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:10%
and the water that
flows through it.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:10%
Those are symbols, in
turn, of yin and yang, yin,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:10%
the wet, dark principle
of the universe, yang,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:10%
the dry, warm principle
of the universe,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:10%
that are also equated
with female and male.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:10%
So the garden includes
all these aspects

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:10%
that make it a
philosophical statement,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:10%
as well as a beautiful
thing to look at.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Looking out from the house,
you see not only the garden,

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:10%
but the things that
are beyond the garden.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And that type of garden is
actually called a shakkei,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:10%
a borrowed view garden.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Here at the Japanese
house, we make

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:90%
it work in a number of ways.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:10%
The house was
originally designed

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:10%
so that we could
look across the pond

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:10%
and see Memorial Hall,
the large building that

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:10%
is the last remnant of the
1876 Centennial Celebration.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
The various elements
of the garden

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:90%
all have symbolic meaning.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a pair of trees
in the garden that

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
are both pine trees, but
one is the male pine,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:90%
the other is the female pine.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they are literally
that way, and one has flowers

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and the other one doesn't,
but that they are symbolically

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
shaped so that one looks
large and vertical.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The other looks softer,
gentler, and more horizontal.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.972 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.972 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
garden is thought

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:90%

Near the main entrance

there's a piece of stone
that's not Japanese at all.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.610 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a water

One of the great natural
features of the garden

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:90%
is our pond.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Around the pond, there
are many, many elements

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
that work together to make
it seem even more like a part

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you
are out in a forest,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
you would expect a pond
to have some fish in it.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So our pond has koi,
beautiful fish that are bred

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and have been bred for
centuries in Japan and China

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to have a brilliant coloration
and intriguing patterns.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The koi can't live in
just a still pond, though.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:90%
They need oxygen in the water.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to get the
oxygen naturally into the water

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:90%
is with a waterfall.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So, we have one that
flows into the pond

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and provides a visual
sight to look at.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It also provides the sound of
water flowing into the pond

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And it helps the koi to breathe,
to have oxygen in their water,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
so they can stay alive.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
There's also a mulberry tree
planted over the stream leading

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:90%
into the pond.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's a kind of symbolic
way of feeding the fish.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The mulberry berries can drop
off of the tree into the stream

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and flow down into the pond.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the fish
can enjoy them.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the fish eat a
lot of other things, too.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But at least symbolically, we
have a whole natural world,

the fish living in the pond,

there are a number of

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:10%
We have a number of lanterns
in different styles,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:10%
one by the pond that's very low,
and whose light could shine out

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:10%
across the pond in a
beautiful reflection.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:10%
That kind of lantern is
called a yukimi doro.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:10%
Yukimi has two meanings.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Doro means lantern.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Yukimi can mean to look
at snow, but it can also

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
mean to look at while moving,
so that you might think

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of the change in the reflection
of the light off of the pond

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:90%
as you walked around it.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
There are other lanterns
placed near intersections

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
of the paths, so that
those areas could

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:90%
be lighted at night.

In addition, we have two
Buddhist objects in our garden.

One is a pagoda that
was given to the house

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
by the Mayor of the
city of Kyoto in 1959,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
when the house was brought
here from New York.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The second one is a large
statue of the Bodhisattva Jizo.

can help any child that might
die into their next life.

garden like a quiet guardian,

keeping watch over
things and just

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
making sure that our garden
is always peaceful and quiet.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The materials of the house
are almost all very natural.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The wood is hinoki,
an evergreen that

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
produces a natural insecticide,
like we would think of cedar.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Hinoki is very
easy wood to work.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:10%
It has an interesting
property that after, it's

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:10%
been planed or cut and exposed
to oxygen for a few years,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:10%
it becomes harder,
and then becomes

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:10%
a more durable material.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:84%
That allows the
makers of the house

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
to use it without any finish.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's no varnish,
there's no paint, put on it.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The natural color of
the wood can be enjoyed.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it allows the carpenters to
make complicated, fitted joints

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and hold the house together,
almost like a three

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:90%
dimensional jigsaw puzzle.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of those joints are
held together not by a nail,

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
but by a pin that goes all the
way through the joint from one

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:90%
side to the other.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:10%
The ends of the pin are covered
with kugi kakushi, star shaped

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:10%
or flower shaped
ornaments that punctuate

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:10%

And when we have
the roof repaired,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
we have to bring craftsman over,
and they sit up on the roof,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and they replace
swaths of our roof

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%

The rain falls onto
the roof, comes off,

built into the ground around
the edges of the veranda

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:10%
to catch the rain and
run it off into the pond.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But the teahouse and the
bathhouse don't work that way.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Their roofs are made of
hinoki shingles rather than

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:90%
simply hinoki bark.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're a
little bit smoother,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:90%
so the rain falls a lot faster.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:10%
At the corner of
the copper gutters,

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:10%
there are, instead of
downspouts, chains.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The chains lead the water
simply down to the stream

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and away from the house.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And they have the added
benefit that in a light rain,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the water
makes a light tinkling noise

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:90%
as it comes down the chain.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
It's another example of
how the house, rather

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
than fighting against
nature, uses nature

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:90%

It's a Japanese

also to preserve the materials
that Shofuso is made of.

are the straw mats

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that are on the floor
throughout Shofuso.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They're about an inch
and a half thick.

It's rice straw bound
together, very soft under foot.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The size of the tatami
mats is three foot

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
by six foot approximately,
which traditionally in Japan, is

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the amount of space
one person would

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
need to live, to sleep, to eat,
and to live through the day.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So a tatami room that
has four tatami mats

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
would be considered large
enough for four people.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The kitchen that's
attached to Shofuso

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
would not have been part
of the original structure,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%

for exhibition purposes.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:10%

a little bit with the austerity

of the shoin style.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
He would put a kitchen
on the building that

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
showed the style of a farmhouse
maybe from the late 17th

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:90%
or early 18th century.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The beams are a lot less
smoothly carved, show a lot

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:90%
more of their natural form.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And the wood is a
little bit darker.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The kitchen is a traditional
17th century Japanese-style

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:10%
kitchen.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The oven has a basin for broth,
a wok, and a rice cooker.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The cabinet on one wall of
the kitchen is one of the last

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
pieces of furniture that came
with the house when it was

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
originally brought from
Japan in the 1950s.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:10%
This tansu is
designed so that it

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:10%
has spaces to store
all the things you

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:10%
might need in the
kitchen, plates, cups,

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:10%
but also has open work on
a number of the panels,

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:10%
so that you could actually store
food inside and close it off.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:10%
It's what the Amish would
have called a fly safe.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The bathhouse has a
traditional Japanese soaking

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:90%
bath on one side.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And it has a traditional
urinal and squat toilet

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In the bath, they
use a lot of bamboo.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a good place for it because
it's very humid in Japan,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and the bamboo tends to split
if the weather is too dry.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The bamboo can be
laid along the floor,

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
allowing water to
actually pass through it.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So it can be a good place
to rinse a tea bowl or wash

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
yourself, and that
sort of thing.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>> We also have a tea garden,
which is a traditional type

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:10%
of garden that would be outside
of a Japanese teahouse that

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:10%
guests would make their way
through to come to the teahouse

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:10%
when they were
called by the host.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Off to one side, we have
a small structure called

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:10%
a teahouse, or chashitsu.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:10%
It's a building designed
for serving tea,

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:10%
especially for
serving tea and what,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:10%
in English, we often
call the tea ceremony,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:10%
and what in Japanese
is called chanoyu.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:10%
Chanoyu is not only the
act of serving that tea.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the practice, the
study, the discipline,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of the tea master, who builds
their tea from many elements

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and brings their taste
to a kind of perfection.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.332 align:middle line:10%
In a typical roji, or
tea garden, in Japan,

00:21:28.332 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:10%
you would find that
the garden is divided

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:10%
into an outer section
and an inner section,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:10%
usually by a gateway
in the middle of it.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Our garden at the
Japanese house,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.530 align:middle line:84%
however, is not divided
by a fence or a gate,

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but actually divided
by a stream that passes

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:90%
through the middle of it.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we pass from the outer
garden over a small slab stone

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
bridge into the inner garden,
we go through the same kind

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of psychological
change of intimacy

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that happens in a
tea garden in Japan

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:84%
when you pass through
that central gate.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:10%
The path goes
beside a wash basin

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:10%
called a chozubachi, or
sometimes a tsukubai,

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:10%
in Japanese.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:10%
And right next to that
is a stone lantern,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:10%
allowing the visitor to
use that wash basin even

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:10%
in the dead of night, because
tea ceremonies can be,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:10%
of course, performed not only
in the middle of the day,

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:10%
but any time, day or night.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
After washing their hands
and rinsing their mouth

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
at the stone basin, the guest
would then go into the teahouse

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
through a small door.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Everyone enters the
teahouse at the same level.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if you're a
warlord, a captain of industry,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the President of
the United States,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
or just an ordinary person.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to go into the
room from the floor level up.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great equalizer.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It makes everyone
in the ceremony

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
feel as though they're the same
kind of person as the people

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.757 align:middle line:90%
next to them.

00:23:09.757 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> [JAPANESE]

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The teahouse is for
traditional Japanese tea.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small room
with a very low ceiling.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a small hearth
for heating water.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:10%
There's a tokonoma, which is a
ceremonial niche for exhibiting

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:10%
a scroll and an
ikebana arrangement.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Natural materials
are especially important

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
in the teahouse, where
you're really close to them.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The space is very small,
only about nine feet square.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Through the center
of it, there's

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
a pillar that is so unfinished
that they left the bark on it,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:84%
almost as though the
trees were growing right

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:90%
through the center of the house.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Other materials in that
part of the building

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
include woven hinoki strips
to make the ceilings,

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
and of course, tatami mats.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese tea ceremony
in the 16th century

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:84%
generated two concepts
that are thought

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of as the sort of ruling
aesthetic principles for tea

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
The two ideas are
called wabi and sabi.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Wabi roughly means simplicity,
keeping things simple,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily taking
shortcuts, but keeping

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:90%
things simple and undecorated.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
You might think of the plain
wooden surfaces of the timbers

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Japanese houses, a
beautiful example of wabi.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They're not
decorated in any way.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
They just use their
own natural shape

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of beauty
in and of itself.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Sabi is a related concept.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with simplicity,
but it has even more

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to do with something being
loved and used over generations,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:90%
even hundreds of years.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:10%
One of the examples of it that
we see at the Japanese house

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:10%
is in the repairs
that have been made

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:10%
to the edges of the veranda.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
On a couple of occasions,
we've had Japanese carpenters

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:90%
visit and repair those parts.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, an American carpenter might
simply pull out the whole board

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and replace it.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Japanese
carpenters instead

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
will cut a shape that is an
appealing shape into the wood,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
take away the old damaged
wood, and replace it

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
with wood that almost
perfectly matches the old wood.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a slight
difference in color,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
but that difference points
to the way the house has

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:90%
been used, loved, and aged.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
sabi kind of detail.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, the design
seems to really reflect

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
the principles of Zen, the
ideas of bringing yourself

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to a centered, quiet place,
setting stably, being where

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.250 align:middle line:90%
you are, when you're there.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:27.632 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.632 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>> When you're in a tea
room, whether you're the host

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:10%
or the guest, you should be
completely focused on what

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:10%
you're doing at
any given moment.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You should not
think about anything

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.249 align:middle line:84%
that happened before you
came into the tea room.

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't think
about what you're

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:90%
going to do when you go home.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
For that moment,
when you're there,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
when you're watching
the most prepare tea,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and when you're drinking
it, especially when you're

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
drinking it, you're
thinking only about what's

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:84%
happening right in front of you,
the tea that you're drinking,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
the preparation that
you're watching.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And also the other
people in the room.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So as we practice tea ceremony,
we practice that focus.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We practice maintaining a
very calm and very tranquil

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:90%
state of mind.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep a very tranquil
mood throughout the room.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure that
there's nothing that disturbs

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:90%
the state of mind of the guest.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So it can be a
meditative experience,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:84%
if people want it to
be, or even if they're

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:84%
just sitting and chatting
and have a good time,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.285 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing to
disrupt their good mood.

00:27:29.285 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The scroll that's
hanging in the room today

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:90%
has a very simple phrase on it.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:90%
It's [NON-ENGLISH].

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And meaning of that is, tea
and zen are one, one taste.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We often say that the
taste of tea in the bowl

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:90%
is the taste of Zen.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, the scroll
reflects that idea, also.

Zen is, of course, one
branch or sect of Buddhism.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a branch where the
primary thing that's emphasized

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:10%
is Zen, Zen being the
Japanese pronunciation

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:10%
of the Chinese transliteration
of the Indian term

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:10%
[INDIAN] meaning
meditation, stillness.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a branch of Buddhism that's
all about personal experience

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and personal practice.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:10%
The ideas of shin,
gyo and so are

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:10%
three concepts that
are developed out

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:10%
of the Zen Buddhist world.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:10%
In Zen, we talk about ways
to perceive and understand

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:10%
the world around you.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:10%
One way is the ordinary kind
of perception that we have,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:10%
which at its best, shows
us all the details, all

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:10%
the complexities, of life.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, after
meditating for a long time,

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
one attains a state where
all those details cease

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to matter completely,
and you are reduced

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to the simplest of essences.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, that first state with
all the details is called shin.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:10%
Shin can be translated as
truth, or simply that state

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:10%
with all of the meticulous
details of the universe.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Its opposite is called so.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So is written with a
character that means grass.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And these terms originally were
used for calligraphy criticism,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and developed to talk about this
pure, straight form in shin,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:10%
the very loose and
cursive form of so.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:10%
The Zen practitioner
then learns to understand

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:10%
that neither the shin
perception of all the details,

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:10%
nor the so perception
of none of the details,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:10%
is really perfect perception.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Perfect perception
comes when you

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:10%
transcend the
distinction between shin

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:10%
and so into the perception
called gyo, semi-cursive,

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:10%
if you take it back to
the calligraphy concept.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:10%
At the Japanese house,
those three concepts

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:10%
show up in a number of ways.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:90%
One way is in our pathways.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:84%
We have some areas that are
paved with straight stones that

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
are placed perfectly together in
a very formal, a very straight,

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.852 align:middle line:84%
kind of way, that
we would call shin.

00:30:48.852 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:10%
In other areas, we have
flagstones or stepping stones

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:10%
that are separated, that
are in random shapes.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The most random of
those shapes are what

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:90%
we would call a so pathway.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Between them, you might
think of a pathway

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:10%
that has straight edges, but
irregular stones in the center.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
gyo style pathway.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:18.839 align:middle line:90%
