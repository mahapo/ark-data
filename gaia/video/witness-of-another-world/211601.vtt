more precise because they

me to understand how important

Juan's identity is.

We are much more
than we think we are.

Perhaps from the other
side, the phenomenon

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is moving us to wake up from
the long dream of illusion

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:30.620 align:middle line:90%
so we remember who we are.

the one that brought Juan
to these primordial lands.

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%

was able to finally return

to his source.

in full expansion of

allows Ñande Ru, or God,
to whisper to his ear

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the true name of Juan,
his true identity.

Juan gives himself up

with an open heart.

I can say with confidence
that the phenomenon

01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:01.910 align:middle line:10%
exists because it deeply
affected me on my own journey.

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know more than that.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel the need
to prove its existence.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
know for sure is

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be ready
for the moment when

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon comes knocking
at the doors of our perception

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
because maybe what we see
in front of our eyes--

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.815 align:middle line:84%
it is not more
than our own soul.
