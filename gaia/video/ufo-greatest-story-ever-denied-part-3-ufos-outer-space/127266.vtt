>>UFOs have been a mystery for
hundreds, maybe even thousands,

Hi, I'm Sean Stone.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
This film is about factual
evidence filmed by NASA

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
as early as the 1950s
during supersonic test

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
flights of the X-15 and
throughout the Apollo

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and Shuttle missions, and
currently through filmings

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
made by the International
Space Station.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>>July 17, 1962, Edwards
Air Force Base, California.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:10%
Major Robert White, test pilot
for the United States Air

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:10%
Force, strapped into the X-15.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Attached to a
specifically-designed wing

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
pylon, Major White and his
X-15 were carried aloft

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
by a modified MB-52 Mothership.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Taken to a launch
altitude of 45,000 feet,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:10%
the goal of this
particular test flight

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.775 align:middle line:10%
wished Major White to
take the X-15 higher

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:10%
than it had ever flown before.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:10%
White rapidly accelerated
to a top speed of mach 4.8.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:10%
After 81 seconds
of powered flight,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:10%
the XLR99 engine
exhausted its fuel supply

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:10%
and shut down, leaving the
X-15 to coast to a new FIA

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:10%
absolute altitude
record for pilot

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:10%

feet, 59.6 miles, or 96

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:10%
kilometers above the Earth.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
X-15 flight to qualify

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
the pilot for a United States
Air Force Astronaut Rating.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
While his flight was at
apogee and he was experiencing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.252 align:middle line:84%
over three minutes
of zero gravity,

00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Major White was able to look
out the left-side window

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:90%
of his X-15 aircraft.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, Major
White cued his radio

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.626 align:middle line:84%
and made an excited
transmission.

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
There are things out there.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:90%
There absolutely are.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.204 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
In the August 3, 1962
issue of "LIFE Magazine,"

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.845 align:middle line:84%
Major White commented further
about his UFO encounter while

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
at the very edge of space.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
This was not the only
UFO encounter filmed

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:90%
during this X-15 program.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Several months earlier, during
one of NASA Test Pilot Joseph

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Walker's X-15 flights.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
The camera systems captured
what Walker would later

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
describe as being "five or
six disc shaped or cylindrical

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:90%
objects near his aircraft."

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
On May 11, 1962, at the
Second National Conference

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
on the Peaceful Uses of
Space Research in Seattle,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Washington, Joseph
Walker also claimed

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that one of his mission
objectives during his 1962

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
flights in the X-15
was to detect and film

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
UFOs at high altitudes.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
During his lecture, Walker
showed several photographs

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.304 align:middle line:84%
to the audience of these UFOs he
captured on film, although NASA

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
has since only ever made
one of these frames public.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
"I don't feel like
speculating about them.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.869 align:middle line:84%
All I know is what appeared on
the film, which was developed

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:90%
after the flight."

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:10%
>>The very first astronaut
UFO sighting in space

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:10%
can actually be traced
back to NASA's very first

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:10%
manned orbital mission, which
took place in February of 1962

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:10%
during Project Mercury.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
That particular flight, which
was designated as Mercury MA-6

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
was flown by
Astronaut John Glenn.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And during that
three-orbit mission

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
there was a
well-publicized incident

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.353 align:middle line:84%
where Glenn reported seeing
through the spacecraft

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:57.892 align:middle line:84%
window what he described as
fireflies that were moving

00:04:57.892 --> 00:04:59.382 align:middle line:84%
around outside his
capsule while he

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:90%
was on orbit above the Earth.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>In an effort the minimize
or debunk these fireflies,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:84%
NASA has always
officially claimed

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that what Glenn was
seeing up there was just

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
tiny water droplets that
must've been on the exterior

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.386 align:middle line:84%
skin of the spacecraft, which
had then sublimated to ice

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
in the near-vacuum
orbital environment.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And these ice crystals
were then breaking loose

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and were floating free
around his capsule.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you blindly
trust what NASA claims,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and if you only examine certain
select portions of the MA-6

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
mission evidence that
NASA directly highlights

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to support their hypothesis,
then that official excuse

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
may actually sound
rather plausible.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
However, aboard
each Mercury capsule

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
was a black box audiotape
recording system

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.574 align:middle line:84%
that was designed to
record any verbal comments

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or descriptions that
the astronaut might

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
make during their flight.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we examine the
complete onboard commentary

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
from John Glenn made
during his MA-6 mission,

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:84%
listening to the full, real-time
descriptions as he was actually

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:84%
observing these unidentified
objects in space,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
it very quickly
becomes clear that he

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
was seeing some objects up
there that absolutely were not

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
ice particles emanating
from his capsule.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:44.595 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:10%
>>And during the Mercury
MA-9 mission in May of 1963,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:10%
Astronaut Gordo Cooper
also observed the fireflies

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:10%
outside his capsule
and reported them

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:10%
to the ground via the radio.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And while we
unfortunately do not

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:10%
have the full audio
transmissions from that flight

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:10%
to listen to, the NASA archives
do contain the Mercury MA-9

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:10%
composite air-to-ground
and onboard voice tape

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:10%
transcriptions.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:10%
And just as one example
of this sanitizing,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:10%
if you go to page 3-20 of the
Mercury MA-9 mission transcript

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:10%
document in the
NASA archives, you

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:10%
see that, as soon as
Astronaut Gordo Cooper starts

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:10%
talking about the
fireflies that he is seeing

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:10%
outside a spacecraft window,
those particular comments

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:10%
have indeed been sanitized
with the asterisk marks

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:10%
denoting that specific
descriptive commentary

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:10%
from Cooper was actually omitted
from the official transcript.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:10%
In this official NASA transcript
for the Mercury MA-9 mission,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.975 align:middle line:10%
NASA is blatantly
admitting that they

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:10%
have engaged in
selective editing,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:10%
sanitizing the transcripts
by removing comments

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:10%
from the public
record entirely--

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:10%
in this case, very specific
comments that clearly were

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:10%
related to the fireflies
that Cooper was really

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:10%
seeing outside the window
of his Mercury spacecraft.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not a conspiracy theory
that NASA did this transcript

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:90%
sanitizing.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's conspiracy fact.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:10%
And the reason it was done was
to obfuscate the truth in order

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:10%
to ensure that the
public would only

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:10%
see certain select evidence
that fit NASA's official cover

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.117 align:middle line:10%
story.

00:09:06.117 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
They literally removed some of
the truth about these fireflies

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
from the public record by
classifying those astronaut

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.998 align:middle line:84%
comments in the interest
of national security.

00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:18.489 align:middle line:90%

00:09:18.489 --> 00:12:16.687 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.687 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>When it comes to
unidentified objects that

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.103 align:middle line:84%
were filmed during
the Apollo missions

00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:84%
while the astronauts were
in cislunar space or lunar

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
orbit, nearly 400,000
kilometers away from the Earth,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
the skeptic argument that
these things may just

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
be man-made satellites that were
already up there in lunar orbit

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
loses credibility in
a hurry because we

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
know from the official
historical record

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that there were simply
no known or declared

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
American or Russian
satellites orbiting the moon

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
during any of the
Apollo Lunar missions

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that could possibly account
for any of these objects caught

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
on film.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And NASA's official position is
that the Apollo crews never saw

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and never were in
a position to film

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
any man-made
satellites they were

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
known to already
be up there when

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:90%
they arrived in lunar orbit.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Could these things be
unmanned Russian probes

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
sent to the moon-- one of
their unmanned lunar or Zond

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
remote sensing
platforms, for example.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, no.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The official historical
record tells us

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
what Russian
equipment was up there

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and where it was throughout the
duration of the Apollo program.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:10%
During NASA's first manned
lunar landing, Apollo 11,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:10%
for example, we know the
Soviets sent an unmanned lunar

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:10%
lander that was known as Luna
15 to the moon at the same time

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:10%
the Apollo 11 crew
was up there, but we

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:10%
know from the orbital
ephemeris data for Luna 15

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:10%
and from NASA's own
admission that the Apollo 11

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:10%
crew were never in a
position to see or film

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:10%
that or any other
Soviet space probe

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of the moon.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that the phenomenon
of mass concentrations,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
or mascons, on the
moon, and these mascons

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
can dramatically interfere
with the orbital stability

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
of any man-made satellites
that were put into lunar orbit.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
This mascon effect means that
any free-drifting satellites

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
in lunar orbit were
found to suffer faster

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
than expected
orbital degradation.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So contrary to what many
in the public may think,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
objects placed into
low lunar orbit

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:84%
don't just stay in a stable
orbit around the moon forever.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.066 align:middle line:84%
Mascon effects eventually
can cause the orbit

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of those satellites to
degrade until they just

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
smack into the lunar
surface and are destroyed.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at the data for
every single declared object

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:84%
ever injected into or released
in lunar orbit by the USA

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or the USSR prior to or during
the Apollo program when these

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
UFOs were being filmed, and the
fact is none of these anomalies

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
filmed during the Apollo program
can be ID'ed as being known

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
satellites that were already
up there in lunar orbit.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
There simply was not a
lot of man-made space

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
junk in lunar orbit back during
each of the Apollo missions.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.276 align:middle line:10%
That argument seems to be a
common skeptical assumption,

00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:10%
but it's not supported by much
official historical record

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:10%
evidence.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.541 align:middle line:90%
These objects are UFOs.

00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
these things are,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.623 align:middle line:84%
where they came from, how they
got there, where they're going,

00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:90%
or what they're doing up there.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.639 align:middle line:84%
These are true
identified objects

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of
the moon that were

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.667 align:middle line:90%
captured on film during Apollo.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:10%
>>When STS-48 hit the airwaves,
hundreds of thousands of people

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:10%
suddenly realized there
were unidentified flying

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:10%
objects being filmed by
NASA on the shuttle cameras.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.384 align:middle line:84%
NASA's James Oberg, among
many other debunkers,

00:16:34.384 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
started claiming that
these objects were

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than ice crystals.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:10%
For the most part of
his life, Martyn Stubbs

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:10%
was a producer working
with Dick Clark

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Productions in the late 1960s.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:10%
He produced, directed, shot, and
edited many television programs

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:10%
over the course of 25 years.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Stubbs' work would lead him
to Shaw Cable in Vancouver.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
This gave him the opportunity
to run the cable station, where

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:90%
he would soon make UFO history.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:10%
Martyn Stubbs was once from
an artistic walk of life,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:10%
but that all changed
when a NASA video made it

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:10%
to the public eye.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Martyn Stubbs saw this
and asked the cable owner

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
if he could take one
of the transponders

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
and dedicate it to the
live feeds from NASA's

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:90%
own satellite.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:84%
He was granted a
dish, and Martyn

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
began downloading the
transmissions NASA was blocking

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
from the general public.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:10%
>>Had not been
for Martyn Stubbs,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:10%
this incredible evidence
of UFOs in outer space

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:10%
would never have
surfaced, and NASA

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:10%
would have continued covering
up what they're doing

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.199 align:middle line:10%
and what is there
just above the Earth.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:37.690 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>One of Stubbs' most
compelling videos

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
was the STS-75 footage, what was
called "The Tether Incident."

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
What NASA was
telling us they were

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:84%
doing was releasing a
satellite at the end

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
of this 12-mile-long tether
that would serve as a test

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to see if this energy-producing
satellite could open up

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
a new method of
propulsion for shuttles

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate using fuel.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>If you look up the word
tether in Merriam-Webster's

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
dictionary, here's
what the definition is.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:84%
"Tether; a rope or
chain that is used

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to tie an animal to a
post, wall, et cetera,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
so that it will stay
in a particular area."

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The tether satellite turns
out to be a power generator,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
somewhat like a Tesla coil,
producing a high voltage

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and being dragged through
space and the plasma fields.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
This seems to have disrupted
the balance of plasma

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
in the upper atmosphere, and
these critters, or animals,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.916 align:middle line:84%
that exist in the
space were affected.

00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>>This is the fact
of the matter.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.320 align:middle line:10%
We were really not sure, after
John flew, whether or not

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:10%
there were critters-- living
critters-- out there somewhere.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:10%
>>Critters that were captured
by NASA on that mission, STS-75,

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:10%
in 1996.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:10%
In all my considerable
experience of the entire UFO

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:10%
scenario, I have never seen,
and never expected to see,

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.682 align:middle line:10%
footage like that,
and least of all

00:21:56.682 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:10%
did I expect to see it
on film or tape that

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:10%
had been exposed by the
government in a NASA mission.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:10%
The shuttle Columbia
in this mission

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:10%
was equipped with a very
sophisticated and expensive

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:10%
ultraviolet camera.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
It was sensitive to
the near-ultraviolet.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they were up at 300
miles above the atmosphere,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:84%
they launched,
from the Columbia,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:90%
a small satellite with a tether.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Not long after it was
launched, the tether broke.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>We will record
steadily the whole break

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.165 align:middle line:90%
and call back in the tether.

00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Copy, Claude.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>--go.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Again, it's a view
of the satellite.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.625 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if it had to break,
it did it in the right place.

00:22:49.625 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>And you see-- on
this astonishing film,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
you see the satellite
go drifting far astern

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
of this orbiting Columbia.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The tether, which
is 12 miles long,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
straightens out into a
long, white line, which you

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:90%
can see as plainly as could be.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Columbia and the satellite
now 77 nautical miles apart.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, while this
is all going on,

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
a whole covey of UFOs--
perhaps three dozen of them--

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
manifest to this
ultraviolet camera,

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and they begin moving
around, circulating,

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
looking, for all the world, like
something in an aquarium tank.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>The satellite, again,
just moving into sunrise.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, Houston, of
course, down on the ground

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
is getting this feed
from the Columbia,

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and they ask the astronauts in
the shuttle what can they see.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:90%
What is it they can see?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>You guys getting the image?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.582 align:middle line:84%
>>Franklin, we see a long line,
a couple of star-like things,

00:24:06.582 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of things
swimming in the foreground.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.422 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
what you're seeing?

00:24:11.422 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the long
line is the tether,

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
little bit of debris

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:90%
that kind of flies with us.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>It is like a brilliant, white
bar that looks like a neon

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
sign, and it's 12 miles long.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, what this does is give
you a sort of cosmic ruler

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.175 align:middle line:84%
by which you can get
an idea and an estimate

00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
of the diameter of the UFOs that
are flitting around down there.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you see them
go behind the tether,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that means that you can use
that tether like a ruler

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:90%
to measure the diameter.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And those things that are down
there going behind the tether

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:84%
are between two and three
nautical miles in diameter.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:10%
>>Image stabilization
with UFO tracking analysis

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:10%
reveals the flight paths of the
objects swarming the tether.

Applying object flight

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.157 align:middle line:90%
traveling alongside the tether.

00:25:53.157 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Many of these objects
are traveling forward,

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
coming to a complete
stop, and then traveling

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
back where they came from.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The maneuvers that
these objects are making

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
take an enormous
amount of energy.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the things you
see over and over again

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:84%
is you see UFOs it
follows materialize

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
into the ultraviolet
while you watch.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You see them come
from out of nowhere

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
they are returning

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:90%
a response to the camera.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
You also see them de-materialize
while you have them

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:90%
under observation.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:10%
There's two of the
central things that

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:10%
have gone on with
UFOs since day one--

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:10%
materialization and
de-materialization.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:10%
It's going on in
this film 300 miles

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:10%
above the Earth, photographed
by your government

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:10%
with your astronauts
superintending the whole thing.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.731 align:middle line:84%
>>We completely
unzoomed and you see

00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:90%
the full extent of the tether.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.116 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.116 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] Houston,
that's a much better view.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.909 align:middle line:90%
A lot more contrast--

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>This film proves
our government has

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:84%
known about UFOs, and that they
had been filming and monitoring

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.864 align:middle line:84%
them since at least
the early 1950s.

00:27:56.864 --> 00:27:59.155 align:middle line:84%
>>By viewing this film, you
now have at your fingertips

00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
a way to find out
more about Earth

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and what exists just a
few hundred miles above us

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and in the farthest
reaches of outer space.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:10%
>>We wish to acknowledge
Martyn Stubbs

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:13.545 align:middle line:10%
for opening the window of truth
about UFOs from outer space.

00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:10%
>>My name is Mike Bara,
and basically I've

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:10%
had a fascination with space
and aliens and UFOs and things

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:10%
since as long as I can remember,
since I was a little kid.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s I was just
four, five, six years old,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and I remember watching
the rocket launches

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:84%
on TV, the Gemini missions,
the Apollo missions.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.044 align:middle line:84%
And I remember always thinking
that there was something

00:28:42.044 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
showing us, that there

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
was a greater mystery
to the whole thing

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
than we were being
allowed to see on TV.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know where
that thought came from,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
or why it was embedded in
me, but it just always was.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I can distinctly remember
the Apollo 11 moon landing

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
when Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin walked

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
on the moon for the first
time in human history,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
or at least in this version
of humanity's history.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
you know, why is this just

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
some crappy
black-and-white picture?

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it color?

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:90%
We had a color TV in my home.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:90%
We were lucky in those days.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my dad, who
was an engineer at Boeing,

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.312 align:middle line:90%
why don't they have it in color?

00:29:22.312 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it just this
really terrible

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
black-and-white TV picture?

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.295 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I really don't

00:29:26.295 --> 00:29:28.337 align:middle line:84%
know because the
distance involved doesn't

00:29:28.337 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:90%
make that much difference.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.336 align:middle line:84%
A TV signal's still going
to be strong enough.

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.699 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't know the
answer, and that shocked me

00:29:34.699 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
because my dad always
knew the answer

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to engineering and technical
questions like that.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And it really
stirred my curiosity,

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and it got me
thinking more and more

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.232 align:middle line:84%
that there was more to
NASA and the space program

00:29:47.232 --> 00:29:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and what was out there
than we were being told.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And it really reinforced
that inherent belief

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like I
was almost born with.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:90%
So then things progressed.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:90%
We went to Mars.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%
The Viking missions happened.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I distinctly remember
the face on Mars,

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:84%
when it was first a big
shock in the newspaper

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that this thing looked
like a human head

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Mars.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
whole controversy.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh well,
we took another picture

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hours later,
and it all just went away.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It was just a trick
of light and shadow.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was the official
position within NASA.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.685 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, it had to
be 15 years after that

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that I started reading
about the face on Mars,

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and I found out that
that claim by NASA

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:84%
was totally untrue--
that the fact was

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that it was nighttime
on Mars, and they

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have taken another
picture a few hours later.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when they
did find a second picture,

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.820 align:middle line:84%
it looked even more like a
face and it has initially.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.654 align:middle line:84%
So I began to look
at this stuff on Mars

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and work that was being done
by other people in the field,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
like Richard C Hoagland,
and saying to myself,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I like this because, unlike
UFOs and abductions and videos

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of bright lights in
the sky and stuff,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.916 align:middle line:84%
this is something I feel
like I could actually

00:30:56.916 --> 00:30:59.275 align:middle line:84%
sink my teeth into, that
I could actually test,

00:30:59.275 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that we could get
more pictures, and we

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
could see what this
thing really was

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and determine whether or
not it was artificial.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
all that happened.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We got picture after
picture after picture

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%
of the face on Mars.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:84%
NASA continued to insist that
it was absolutely of no interest

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.680 align:middle line:84%
to them, yet it's the
most photographed piece

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
of real estate on
the planet Mars.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
not interested in,

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
why do they keep taking
pictures of the thing?

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole ancient
aliens thing took off.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at
ancient aliens on Mars

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:90%
and ancient aliens on the moon.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.739 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely artificial
structures on the moon.

00:31:33.739 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:10%
There's definitely artificial
structures on Mars.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:10%
And even the little rovers, as
they drive around the Martian

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:10%
surface, keep finding stuff
that looks like, I don't know,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.214 align:middle line:10%
mechanical equipment?

00:31:45.214 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm a mechanical engineer,
and I can certainly

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.020 align:middle line:10%
tell a cased metal
object when I see one.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:10%
And I can certainly tell when
I see mechanical flywheels

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.220 align:middle line:10%
and gears and
something that looks

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:10%
like Captain Kirk's phaser
that he dropped on the surface.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:10%
I can recognize all these
things as mechanical implements.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:10%
And so it became
really obvious to me

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:10%
that there absolutely was
solid evidence that somebody

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:10%
had lived on Mars before.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.603 align:middle line:10%
And whether they were
human or completely alien,

00:32:12.603 --> 00:32:14.436 align:middle line:10%
I don't know the answer
to that, and I don't

00:32:14.436 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:10%
know that anybody ever will.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:10%
But it seems like
human architecture,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:10%
and it seems like human
mechanical design,

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:10%
so it may be related to this
idea that the Hopi have,

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.684 align:middle line:10%
that there have been
progressive worlds of man

00:32:29.684 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:10%
and that we've gotten very
advanced in some of them.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:10%
And the last one was even more
advanced than we are today,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and maybe they went to Mars and
built some of these pyramids

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:10%
and built some of this
equipment and left it behind.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's all eroded
and stuff now,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:10%
but to me, I just kept
getting reinforced by this.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And then you start
asking other questions,

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:10%
like if there are ruins
on another planet,

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:10%
on Mars-- if there are ruins on
the moon that definitely can be

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:10%
described as artificial,
that engineers can recognize

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:10%
as instrumentalities--
different vehicles,

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:10%
different mechanical
implements, air conditioners,

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.190 align:middle line:10%
things like that-- then you
say to yourself, well, OK.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
If there was a prior
civilization living

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:84%
on these planets,
then there could have

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.364 align:middle line:90%
been a whole bunch of them.

00:33:16.364 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then that begins to
reinforce, to me, the idea

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that maybe all these
stories of alien abduction

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and alien contact
aren't so crazy.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:10%
So I was very lucky.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been lucky
enough to have worked

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:84%
for some major
television networks,

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and I've worked on a
couple different shows,

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
"Ancient Aliens"
being one of them.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:10%
I got to do a show called
"Uncovering Aliens"

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:10%
for the Discovery networks.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was really interesting
because they cast me

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.130 align:middle line:84%
as the skeptic, which
actually fit me really well

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
because, even though I believe
that all this stuff is real,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't really lock
into that until I

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.300 align:middle line:90%
got all my questions answered.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So I became the guy that
would ask all the questions

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.670 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've certainly known
people who've been abducted.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I've known people who
had these experiences.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.832 align:middle line:84%
But when I started meeting them
kind of at random for the show,

00:34:05.832 --> 00:34:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and they started describing
what had happened to them

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and these intruders in their
rooms at night, and the things

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.805 align:middle line:90%
that they did.

00:34:12.805 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:84%
As I was questioning
these individuals,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.136 align:middle line:84%
I realized they're not crazy
because the reality is that we

00:34:20.136 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:90%
can't ignore this anymore.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.090 align:middle line:84%
We cannot ignore
visitations in our bedrooms.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We cannot ignore
UFOs in our skies.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And we absolutely cannot
ignore UFOs in outer space.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.170 align:middle line:10%
My name is Laura
"Magdalene" Eisenhower.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:10%
I am the great-granddaughter
of President Eisenhower.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And all throughout
my life, I've had

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot of interesting
experiences that

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:84%
helped me to be very
open to the idea

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is other
life in this universe.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And what really
kick-started my research

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:10%
was a lot of the rumors
that I saw about Eisenhower

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:10%
in ET-government treaties.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:10%
When I was young, I
had contact experience.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:10%
I also experienced a
recruitment to Mars

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:10%
in 2006, which helped
me to understand what's

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:10%
going on behind the scenes.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So as I've been working
to connect the dots,

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I have had a lot of
revelations and epiphanies

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
about how the light
and dark operate,

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and what our role is
as a humanity to be

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:90%
prepared for what's to come.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.320 align:middle line:90%
to what they contain.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.545 align:middle line:10%
I urge everyone to go
to MarsMoonSpace.com

00:38:46.545 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:10%
and check out the video starring
Neville Thompson, Martine

by Thomas Mikey Jensen.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:10%
In order to get a
full grasp of what's

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:10%
going on in these images,
the important discoveries

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:10%
made by these researchers
need to be seen and heard.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:10%
I am fortunate to have
found them for my film,

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:10%
and I thank them
deeply for their work.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:84%
In 2001, I was checking
one of NASA's websites

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
featuring photography taken
by the Mars Odyssey mission.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And in a few of
the photos I found

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
a UFO that appeared
in different locations

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
on Mars-- different
terrains this UFO appears.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same shape,
same kind of design,

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely in the
air over these certain areas

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.160 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.909 align:middle line:90%
So here they are.

>>Our sun is 93 million
miles from Earth.

00:42:15.286 --> 00:42:17.800 align:middle line:84%
To give you an idea as
to the size of our sun

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:84%
when compared to Earth
and the other planets

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:84%
in our immediate solar
system, I have situated

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the sun in the middle and
put each planet on the side

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
so you have an easy
scale to size comparison,

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.290 align:middle line:84%
starting with Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars, and so on.

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter, being the
largest of all planets,

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.290 align:middle line:84%
is still dwarfed by
the sun's immense size.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
The SOHO program, known as
the Solar and Heliospheric

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Observatory, is comprised of two
cameras situated on either side

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:90%
of the sun in deep space.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:84%
These two cameras allow NASA
to catch film and photography

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:84%
in stereo, and
when seen together,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:90%
give them the depth of 3D.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:10%
In 2001, I had seen early
footage of anomalies

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:10%
appearing near the
sun and passing by it,

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:10%
flying into it, and on several
occasions, firing at it.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.810 align:middle line:84%
You could see what appeared
to be laser beams shot

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
into the sun, and the
reaction of impact

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
showed a tremendous
amount of explosions.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.160 align:middle line:84%
In or around 2007 or 2008,
it came to my attention

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that things were seen
orbiting the sun in hundreds

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:90%
of photographs.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Once I heard about
this, I immediately

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:90%
went to the SOHO website.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I began downloading hundreds
of these photographs.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:84%
There were so many that in
the space of a few days,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
I had compiled about 400 photos.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:84%
There would have been more, but
I got busy working on my films,

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.430 align:middle line:84%
figuring that someday
I would do a segment

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.900 align:middle line:84%
or documentary on these sun
ships, as they'd been called.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
There are now many
researchers in the world

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:84%
finding, compiling, and
presenting these sun ships

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.620 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube and other websites.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.270 align:middle line:84%
For this film, I
am including some

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of the most spectacular
photos taken

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:84%
by NASA of these
anomalous objects,

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and submitted by researchers.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.056 align:middle line:84%
I have looked through the many
photos I downloaded in 2008

00:44:05.056 --> 00:44:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and some of the latest
photography that

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:84%
reveals these sun ships
are still orbiting the sun

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and doing whatever
it is they're doing.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.220 align:middle line:84%
There are literally thousands
of photographs posted daily

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:90%
on the website.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds of UFOs
showing up near the sun.

>>In 2012, I came across a video
that interested me right away.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.660 align:middle line:10%
It was called "Giant
Space Cables,"

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:10%
and was being
presented by a YouTube

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:10%
channel called UniversalTrek.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately taken by these
gigantic space cables, where

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:84%
they came from, who built
them, where they go,

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and what they are
being used for.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:06.420 align:middle line:10%
The amazing cables
came from nowhere.

downward, upward,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.710 align:middle line:10%
and to all sides where
these cables can be seen,

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:14.340 align:middle line:10%
there was no real explanation

can only wonder, who made them,

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.550 align:middle line:10%
do they go to, who is
traveling through them,

are there giant people using
them, are we using them,

I myself went on
Google Earth and Space

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.790 align:middle line:10%
looking for these
cables, and although I

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:10.640 align:middle line:10%
did find some tube-like
structures in deeper space,

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.460 align:middle line:10%

the original space

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.490 align:middle line:10%

These motherships, as

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:26.400 align:middle line:84%
are so far away and so large
that one person made a comment.

There was one or
more of these that

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.910 align:middle line:84%
are the size of the distance

When you go to the Sky Map, you
will get the main landing page.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:44.190 align:middle line:84%

see a small square appear where

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.230 align:middle line:84%
this object is located
on the Sky Map.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Then you zoom in,
and soon you will

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.870 align:middle line:84%
see the object that is
located in these coordinates.

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.000 align:middle line:84%
The Zoom tool, by the
way, is backwards.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Pull it downward in
order to zoom in.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Going up will make it zoom out.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You can pause the film
to be able to type

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.080 align:middle line:84%
these coordinates into the
search field on the Sky Map.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%

some pretty amazing objects

"once you start lying, thought,

you kinda gotta keep lying."

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%

deeper and deeper.

In many ways, it seems
that's what they've

benefiting mankind,

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the covering up

above hyper-advanced
technology that

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
could do away with our
dependence on fossil fuels.

in ways that we really
don't even know,

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
as the general public,
because of how deep this goes.

I've talked to have discussed

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%

being not 5 or 10,

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
or 15 years ahead of
what the public perceives

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
state-of-the-art to be, but
to being 100 years ahead,

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.070 align:middle line:90%
200 years ahead, more than that.

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe that the
United States of America

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
did acquire alien technology
and was reverse engineering it,

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and is reverse engineering
it-- if they're

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
sitting on this stuff,
why aren't we privy to it?

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The interest of national
security argument--

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
holds any water anymore.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it did at the
dawn of the Cold War.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:09.970 align:middle line:84%
They could have got
away with that argument,

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.180 align:middle line:90%
and they could justify that.
