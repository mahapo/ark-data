00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And then he would bring
himself back to life.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Every human being in the
world has a supernatural power.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But having doesn't mean
anything if you don't know

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:90%
how to use it.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yoga combines the physical,
mental, and spiritual forces.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:10%
Bikram must be in
complete control,

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:10%
or he's in danger
of being impaled.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Here he goes!

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:90%
He did it!

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And Yogi Bikram is all right.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But before you use it,
you have to realize it.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why Yogananda
called Self-Realization.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:90%
You have to realize that power--

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
supernatural, cosmic, physical,
mental, spiritual power.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't take my
word for anything.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Apply these techniques and
find out for yourselves.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is a small, brown mystic
from a nation that very few

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Americans had ever been
to, much less read about.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And he is here delivering
his message with such force

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
through personal transmission
to people who came to see him.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Most important is to create
a church within yourself where

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you are the minister in the
temple of your own soul.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.319 align:middle line:10%
>> When somebody is
in a deep meditation,

00:41:17.319 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:10%
there are changes in the brain.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:10%
We've seen changes
in the brain scans

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.910 align:middle line:10%
of the different parts of the
brain that become more active.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing during
a meditation practice

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
is a very substantial
decrease of activity

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:84%
in the part of the brain
which normally helps

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
to create a sense of our self
and a sense of our orientation

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:84%
As you progressively block
the activity in that area,

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
then you block your ability to
establish your sense of self

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
as distinguished from
the rest of the world.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to feel that
sense of deep connectedness,

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:84%
or oneness, with
everything in the world.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.184 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a physicist
and a physician.

00:41:54.184 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I spent years between the
Harvard physics department

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and the Harvard Medical
School, going back and forth

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
across the Charles River, but
they don't talk to each other.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.570 align:middle line:10%
As a child, having
been exposed to things

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:10%
like Vedic philosophy, growing
up in rural Mississippi,

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:10%
I became inspired
by this deep belief

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.540 align:middle line:10%
that there is an
underlying unity in nature.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I wish these different
fields could come together.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that led me to want
to combine these two worlds

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of physics and biomedicine.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Physics-- our physics
of the last century--

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.840 align:middle line:84%
has not come to terms with
life, living systems, and things

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.530 align:middle line:90%
like consciousness.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.710 align:middle line:84%
The writings of
Yogananda are very

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:84%
appealing to a
scientific appetite.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
He was committed to
bringing together

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
the technology and the
material efficiency

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific
understanding of the West

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient spiritual
wisdom of the East

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and creating a unified framework
and an integrated approach

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:90%
to living life on this planet.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In Washington, something
remarkable happened.

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda drew the largest
audience as a public speaker

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.080 align:middle line:90%
had drawn in the city--

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
congressmen, senators,
judges-- and he

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.786 align:middle line:84%
was even invited to the White
House by President Coolidge.

00:43:27.786 --> 00:43:30.460 align:middle line:10%
But Yogananda came in
for a rude awakening

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.350 align:middle line:10%
when he was in Washington,
which is really

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:10%
part of the American South.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In the national capital, I
was told that white people only

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.320 align:middle line:84%
would be permitted to
attend the classes.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:10%
This surprised me very much.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I defied this and founded
an Afro-American yoga center

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.936 align:middle line:90%
to teach my Negro brethren.

00:43:50.936 --> 00:43:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic delusion is
always snaring us

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:01.820 align:middle line:90%
through our ignorance.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The Civil Rights Movement
was still decades away,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:10%
and it was inspired, in fact, by
a revolution that was fomenting

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:10%
in India.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people don't realize
that Gandhi was a yogi,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and he was putting yoga
principles such as nonviolence

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.970 align:middle line:90%
into action on a mass scale.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogananda himself was a
very open and vocal supporter

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of Gandhi and lectured at
Harvard about him and his

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And for this, he was put on
a government watch list and kept

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:10%
under surveillance.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Anyone affiliated with
India and someone specifically

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:10%
affiliated with Mahatma Gandhi
would be a person of interest

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:10%
for the American government.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are these people drawn
to this heathen teacher?

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.670 align:middle line:84%
What is he doing
behind closed doors?

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to overthrow
our government too?

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There was literally a
war against yoga being waged

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:10%
in the media.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:10%
>> A huge scandal erupted
when Swami Dhirananda,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:10%
Yogananda's right-hand man,
was discovered giving private

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:26.640 align:middle line:10%
lessons to a married woman, and
her husband found out about it,

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:10%
stormed Mount Washington,
and a brawl erupted.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There were crazy
tracts being written--

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.600 align:middle line:84%
rumors, all kinds
of allegations,

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.900 align:middle line:84%
not just about Yogananda,
but some of the other swamis

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and yoga teachers, that
this was a love cult

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were corrupting
the women of America.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogananda, as a yogi, would
often talk about mastery over

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.350 align:middle line:84%
one's sexuality, over one's
own urges, self-discipline.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes that
was misinterpreted

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:90%
to mean something scandalous.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You had a kind of paranoia
on the part of the husbands

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and law enforcement
officials that, you know,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:15.299 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't trust our women with
these dark-skinned foreigners.

00:46:15.299 --> 00:46:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You can read between the
lines here what the problem

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.640 align:middle line:90%
really is.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.895 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this was a period
where miscegenation laws--

00:46:20.895 --> 00:46:22.810 align:middle line:10%
you know, you were
forbidden in America

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:10%
if you were white to marry a
brown-skinned man or woman.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it was illegal to
mix the races at that point.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:10%
>> This marriage is symbolical
of breaking down the barriers

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:10%
of the brown Caucasian of
India and the white Caucasian

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.310 align:middle line:10%
of America.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:44.205 align:middle line:10%
>> Ohm.

00:46:44.205 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Amen.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.600 align:middle line:10%
Ohm.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> On the one hand, open-minded
Americans revered him,

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
but his unorthodox views
really raised the ire of more

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:90%
conservative Americans.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.700 align:middle line:84%
By the time he went
into the Deep South,

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:84%
it really reached
a fevered pitch.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Swami was ordered to leave
Miami for his own safety.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.200 align:middle line:84%
The husbands of more
than 200 Miami women

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.070 align:middle line:84%
were preparing to
quote, "get the Hindu."

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.070 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> His supporters
swarmed City Hall.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And during the hearing,
Police Chief Quigg

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.850 align:middle line:84%
claims that Yogananda
tried to hypnotize him.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogananda is no longer being
invited to receive the keys

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:90%
to different cities.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:84%
He's no longer being
invited to speak

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to different religious
congregations.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I am going through the
severest trial of my life.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.493 align:middle line:84%
Judge for yourself the lying
capacity of the newspapers.

00:47:56.493 --> 00:48:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in Los Angeles, the
District Attorney eventually

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:84%
cleared Yogananda and Mount
Washington of all wrongdoing,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but the damage had
already been done.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The fruits of a lifetime
of service to mankind reduced

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to ashes by the soulless
efforts of yellow journalism.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> All these incidents
culminated in a falling out

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.840 align:middle line:84%
between Yogananda
and Dhirananda.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Dhirananda left and he
started another organization

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.900 align:middle line:90%
not far from Mount Washington.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And many of the students
went with Dhirananda

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.570 align:middle line:84%

a couple of years later,

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.400 align:middle line:84%
when Dhirananda left the swami
order altogether and married

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.080 align:middle line:90%
one of his Los Angeles students.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Then he sued Yogananda
for his share of the work

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.697 align:middle line:90%
they had done together.

I'm starting for Mexico,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.753 align:middle line:90%
to God entirely.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Divine Mother, free me.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me go back to India to
serve you there-- not here,

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
where there is bitterness
and heartache and frustration

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.894 align:middle line:84%
and no one to listen
to your message.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In Yogananda's darkest hours,
there's only one place that he

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:31.864 align:middle line:90%
went.

00:50:31.864 --> 00:50:32.780 align:middle line:90%
He always went within.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:84%
We call it God,
place of stillness.

>> Many times I have tried
to walk away from these

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:84%
organizational responsibilities,
but every time Divine Mother

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.270 align:middle line:84%
comes and takes me by the
ear and says, come back.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, when I
received that answer, I wept.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I had to go back.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.157 align:middle line:84%
I knew this is what
God wanted from me.

00:51:44.157 --> 00:51:48.630 align:middle line:90%

>> Walking only under
the guise of denunciation

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.510 align:middle line:84%
or non-attachment
is the easy part.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It shows more spiritual
fiber to live a godly life

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.210 align:middle line:90%
in the jungle of civilization.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I love all, even those who
avow themselves my enemies.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.190 align:middle line:90%
For I see thee in every being.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:23.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I will rebuild this
organization from scratch,

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:34.630 align:middle line:84%
just as I did when I
arrived from India in 1920.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> With that renewed faith and
the determination that he would

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.850 align:middle line:84%
not give up, even though he
was sorely tried and wanted

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to leave, he began
to draw disciples.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.510 align:middle line:90%
One of them was me.

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I came in 1931, and many
other young people came.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.850 align:middle line:90%
There were older people here.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That was all ages living here.

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogananda had consistently
drawn his devotees from all

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:90%
walks of life--

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.660 align:middle line:84%
prominent businessmen
judges, lawyers,

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:90%
even hardened journalists.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But by the early 1930s,
something very different was

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.920 align:middle line:90%
beginning.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
A small core group of
devotees came to Yogananda

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and asked to be accepted
into this monastic path

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of complete renunciation,
to completely devote

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:27.560 align:middle line:84%
their whole lives to
following his teachings,

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.498 align:middle line:84%
and seeking God through this
path of Kriya Yoga meditation.

00:53:31.498 --> 00:53:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:38.380 align:middle line:84%
James Lynn, the wealthy
businessman, was one of them.

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And he'd go on to become
a highly advanced yogi

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and take monastic
vows like the others.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, through Yogananda, this
ancient monastic swami order

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:55.570 align:middle line:90%
from India took root in America.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Now began the training.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I knew nothing
about renunciation.

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The new monastics took strict
vows, like Yogananda himself,

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.095 align:middle line:84%
of simplicity, celibacy,
obedience, and loyalty.

00:54:11.095 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda's lay students
faced other challenges.

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd been there about
six or seven weeks.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:10%
And I said, Guruji, all my
life I heard thou canst not,

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:10%
thou shalt not, thou must not.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the rules of the
religious teachings that I've

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:90%
heard around my relatives.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.160 align:middle line:84%
What I want to know from
you is, what canst thou?

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, (MIMICKING
YOGANDA) well, do you smoke?

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.370 align:middle line:90%
He said, you may continue.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you drink alcohol?

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:48.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.680 align:middle line:90%
He said you may continue.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you enjoy the opposite
sex promiscuously?

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, you may continue.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You mean that I can
come up on this hill

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.340 align:middle line:84%
here, in this good
place with all

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.920 align:middle line:84%
of these wonderful people,
your disciples and the devotees

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and the brothers up here,
and study these teachings,

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and I go back down there
and do all these things.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.860 align:middle line:84%
(MIMICKING YOGANANDA)
Absolutely.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But I will not promise
you that as you continue

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:84%
to study these teachings that
the desire to do these things

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:28.830 align:middle line:90%
will not fall away from you.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Repeated performance of
inaction creates a mental

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.360 align:middle line:84%
blueprint, causing the formation
of subtle electrical pathways

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.920 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, somewhat like the
grooves in a phonograph record.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Your life follows the
grooves that you yourself

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:90%
have created in the brain.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears that Yogananda was
talking about neuroplasticity

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
almost 50 years before Western
doctors took an interest in it.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.890 align:middle line:84%
He said that regular
Kriya practice

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:03.762 align:middle line:84%
could rewire your brain and
help eliminate unwanted habits.

00:56:03.762 --> 00:56:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So "The
Autobiography of a Yogi"

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is the book that I keep stacks
of them around the house,

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:14.005 align:middle line:84%
and I give it out constantly,
you know, to people.

00:56:14.005 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:84%
You know like when people need
re-grooving, I say, read this.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We are not talking
about suppression.

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.140 align:middle line:10%
We are talking
about transmutation.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.500 align:middle line:10%
Re-channeling-- that's the
whole science of yoga--

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.550 align:middle line:10%
re-channeling your
energy, creating

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:35.560 align:middle line:10%
new patterns of thinking, new
patterns of the emotional life.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.320 align:middle line:90%


00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When he looked at you
penetratingly, he was changing.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:10%
He said when he
looked at you, he

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:46.960 align:middle line:10%
was changing your brain cells.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.580 align:middle line:10%
And he did.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> He started going in to my
inner thoughts and feelings,

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:56.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe things where
you've slipped a little.

00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:00.420 align:middle line:84%
He dissected me on the
deepest level I'd ever been.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
being carved down

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:08.000 align:middle line:84%
until a little tiny person,
down to almost like an ant.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I just literally
couldn't take any more.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I humanly, emotionally
couldn't take it.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was hurting.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:19.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was crying.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:24.690 align:middle line:84%
He reached over, and
he gave me a big hug.

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I've given you my
unconditional love, he says.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Do not fail to take
advantage of it.

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.322 align:middle line:84%
It's a friendship and a love
that he took you as you were,

00:57:35.322 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and he gave it all to you,
as much as you could take.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:46.224 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.224 --> 00:57:48.170 align:middle line:90%
[THUNDER]

and my guru.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.994 align:middle line:90%
He's haunting me day and night.

00:57:58.994 --> 00:58:02.000 align:middle line:90%
(LOUDLY) Return to India.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.153 align:middle line:84%
You must come make
the supreme effort.

Traversing 10,000 miles in
the twinkling of an eye,

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:19.600 align:middle line:84%
his message penetrated my being
like a flash of lightning.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I have spent 15 years in
spreading my guru's teachings

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.080 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.091 align:middle line:90%
Now he recalls me.

00:58:26.091 --> 00:58:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.150 align:middle line:10%
Our arrival found such an
immense crowd assembled

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.950 align:middle line:10%
to greet us, I was
unprepared for the magnitude

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:45.825 align:middle line:10%
of our welcome.

00:58:45.825 --> 00:58:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We broke our journey
halfway across the continent

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.098 align:middle line:90%
to see Mahatma Gandhi.

00:58:56.098 --> 00:59:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.860 align:middle line:84%
After great discussions, he took
lessons, Kriya, and recharging

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.420 align:middle line:90%
exercises.

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I was touched by his
spirit of inquiry.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.290 align:middle line:84%
When we prayed together,
the whole place

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.030 align:middle line:90%
seemed filled with God.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:20.390 align:middle line:90%
