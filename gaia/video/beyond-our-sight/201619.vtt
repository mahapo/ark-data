00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1970, 44 years ago
when I was a young man,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I had a near-death experience.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:10%
I was killed in a motorcycle
wreck in Eugene, Oregon.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to have this
wreck in front of an ambulance

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
location.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.987 align:middle line:84%
And they just came
around, picked me up,

00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and took me to the hospital.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They put me in the ICU,
the intensive care unit.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And about three hours
later, I went into a coma.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I had rather extensive--
there's scars here

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:90%
on my wrist and stuff.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Leg injuries.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:90%
I have steel in my femur here.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I have lost the kneecap
on my right leg.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Part of my wrist was
up here by my elbow,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:90%
pushed up under the skin.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty well destroyed.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So three hours later,
I went into a coma,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and I went out of body.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was about
five years old,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I was recommended to go
in for a tonsillectomy

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.352 align:middle line:84%
because my tonsils were
supposedly infected.

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that they
actually weren't, so the doctor

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%
didn't take them out.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
But I did go through
the operation.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
What happened was they took
me into the operating room.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And in those days,
they had a big mask

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that they put over you
for the anesthetic.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
different than nowadays.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And when they put the
mask over my face,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
he said, you know, he just said,
breathe deeply, so I breathed,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was OK pretty much,
except that of course,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I went out right away, which
I would, being five, you know?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I knew, I
just shot up out of my body.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, I looked
down and saw myself

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:90%
being operated on and stuff.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hmm, that's
interesting, you know?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking
at myself and them.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.902 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I became aware of my
clairvoyance at the age of 14

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:90%
through a near-death experience.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Off and on for six years,
I just came to a point

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
where I began to
hear, feel, and see.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:10%
I had a second near-death
experience at 41

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:10%
in a head-on collision.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that experience,
all I can remember

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
is rising above my body
into a vibrant green light.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And when the two cars hit,
I never felt anything.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't present.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I was
hovering above my body.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:90%
I could see myself very clearly.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I could see myself
three dimensionally.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness was
floating above my body.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The thinking part
of me was up here.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
This down here just felt like
a shell, but it was my shell.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I totaled my automobile and
my spirit and soul immediately

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:10%
left my body in the car and
went through the tunnel we hear

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:10%
people talk about quickly, all
the way through to the other

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:10%
end and out the other end
into pure white light.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I also was spoken to with a
voice, what some people call

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.355 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with God.

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I was told immediately when
I entered the pure light

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
by a male voice--

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and we all hear
whatever voice we

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
need to hear in whatever
language in which

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:90%
we need to hear it--

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
telling me, Lewis,
you were called here

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
to have this conversation and
to be sent back, because you

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
are not doing your work.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The being of light
is definitely a being,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
but not with a face, a
figure, anything else.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It's more of an energy center.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a white light that's
described as having gold

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
around the edges, if you wish.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the brightest,
prettiest, most loving light

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I've never been so in love
or at home or with my family

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:90%
or with--

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:90%
it's where I'm from.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:10%
And I felt that this being and
I had known each other for--

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:10%
I used the term thousands
of years or eons.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:90%
We'd always known each other.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
There was no beginning,
no end to how long

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
we've known each other.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
If you think of each of
our consciousnesses as one

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
little grain of sand and
infinite intelligence

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
as the whole beach of sand,
I was plugged back in.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
My little grain of sand was back
on the beach where I belonged,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:90%
where I came from.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I saw somebody
come up to me in a black dress,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and it was my great grandmother
whom I'd actually known until I

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:90%
was about--

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
well, she died when I was,
I think, two and a half,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.537 align:middle line:90%
I called her Gaga.

00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Everybody called her that.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, Gaga, I haven't
seen you in such a long time.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And I put out my hand.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
She took my hand and she
said, well, you're just here

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:90%
for a little visit.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in a corridor,
like a building that we

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:90%
had gone into.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was a long
corridor with doors off of it

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:84%
like a school like
classrooms, different rooms.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, they opened the door to
the classroom and they said,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
you can look at this.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is a classroom.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:90%
People are learning things.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were at a keyboard.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
They were actually-- and you
have to realize, this is 1951,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:90%
because I was born in 1945.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:84%
There were no such things
as computers, especially

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:90%
personal computers.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They were big, huge, room-sized
things then, those days.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.585 align:middle line:84%
And nobody had ever heard
of such a thing, you know?

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
There were
typewriters, of course,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
but these were not
keyboards like that.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They had little squares
and they also lit up.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I could see the light underneath
them, like some of were blue

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and some were red
and some were green.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that the
man told me, he said,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you will see these
later in your life.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But you know, I did have
an encounter in that encounter

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
with a fellow who came to me
and introduced himself as Ben.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
He said that he had come to
be with me in this moment

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
so that I would not have to
have the experience alone.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And told me that the
only thing that I needed

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to know moving forward
from this experience

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
is that I did not have
anything to worry about,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:90%
because I was hurt.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I was hurt and I was trapped
in the car for 45 minutes.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But he had the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and was very gentle.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
He called me by name
from the first meeting.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
He spoke very softly
and very gently.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:10%
As soon as he touched me,
I completely went limp.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But then as he stepped
back from the car,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:84%
he said, I have to
go now, and smiled

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and vanished in thin air.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I had literally
been touched by an angel.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in this state
of consciousness,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
which was with my soul and
my spirit at this source.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer
in my body at all.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I surrender.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Take me.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm yours.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I will do your work.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was told immediately, no.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not my work you
need to do, Lewis.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:90%
It's your work.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I then asked, well,
what is my work?

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
Since I was in a place
where all knowledge is known

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel that,
I assumed I was going

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:90%
to be told what my work is.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:10%
And instead of being
told, I was asked, well,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:10%
what is it that keeps you
from being all you are capable

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:10%
of being?

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know, because
I thought everything was fine.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So I felt something
about difference

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that prevented my
soul from connecting

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:90%
with the soul of another.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I did not know how
to bridge the gap.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I said
this in the light,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:84%
in my conversation
with God, then just

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
like the best moment
in the movie "Amadeus"

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:84%
when Mozart hit a
perfect note and went,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
there it is, the voice of God
said to me, there it is, Lewis.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:90%
There is your work.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And that was my conversation.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I was then sent back down
the entire same tunnel

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
in white light until I
remember coming into the body,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:90%
until those tight rubber gloves.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not fully in until I am.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:90%
[POP]

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
--this white light
disappeared, and I

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in my automobile,
a totaled automobile, badly

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
damaged, with no
physical damage.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.635 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out of the car
into the ambulance to tell them,

00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:53.435 align:middle line:90%
there's no problem.

00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a young
man in my early 20s,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and I decided to come back here.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't done with the
reason I had been here.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I clearly remember squeezing
down, getting smaller,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and coming into my body.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like slamming back into
the pain of this existence.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So I come back, and at that
time, a college student

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
studying mechanical
engineering and physics.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I come back into this life
and I go on with that career.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're teaching
me Newtonian physics.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:10%
They're teaching
me that 3D is it.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:10%
And I'm always, from the
beginning from then on,

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm on the other side.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.167 align:middle line:84%
There's all the
rest of this energy.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
There's all the rest
of this out here.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember going in
specifically to my body except

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, it was like
going down a very small--

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
like a funnel or
something, you know?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like I just
swooshed back in.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the
doctor say, I thought

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
we were going to lose
her there for a minute.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I tried to lift my arm
and it felt so heavy

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:90%
after having been really light.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was so nice being not
in a body, because everything

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
was light and I could
just go where I wanted to

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:90%
without even thinking.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to lift my
arm, and it weighed a ton.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And I thought to myself, oh, no.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Not this again.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And then without
any warning whatsoever,

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
it's just like someone thrust
me back into my body again.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I came to consciousness
about 90 seconds later,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:90%
back in my physical body.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
impaled on the dash

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
with my knee for 45 minutes.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:10%
About 20 minutes after the
accident and after this fellow

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.295 align:middle line:10%
disappeared, then I started
feeling pain in my right foot,

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:10%
in my knee.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
My arm was broken.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:90%
My ribs were broken.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I can remember the young woman
who was bound and determined

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to get me out of the car
and was yanking on the door

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and screaming for people to
help for her to get me out

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:90%
of the car.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But had she got
me out of the car,

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I probably wouldn't walk today.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> First off, when I had the
near-death experience in 1970,

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I started talking about it.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the
head injury floor,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and so the chief
psychiatrist wanted

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.507 align:middle line:84%
to put me in the nuthouse,
because this isn't true.

00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:90%
What, do you think you're Jesus?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
You died and you came back?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
What is that, you know?

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So he wants to throw
me in the nuthouse.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And the nurses, they know.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
They've heard.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:90%
They've seen it too many times.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.795 align:middle line:84%
And they're hugging
me and saying, shh.

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but it's true.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell him.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying to me, so
you think you're Jesus?

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And I say, look.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:90%
You got a degree.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You're a doctor and all that,
but you've never been there.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're telling
me it doesn't exist

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
because you have a degree?

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe they may have
given my body painkillers,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:90%
but I was out of the body.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So people say, well, it's
a drug effect in your mind.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm out of the body.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming
back into the room

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and coming back into the
body and seeing myself

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and coming into it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I finally get out
of the hospital.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:10%
I go to the pastor at
my church and he says,

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:10%
well, it can't possibly
be true, because it

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:10%
doesn't agree with scripture.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:10%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't agree with
your interpretation

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:10%
of the scripture.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Those people who want to
say, well, it was a drug,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
or well, it was
something else, they're

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
looking for it to be something
else because they don't

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
want to hear what we're saying.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say not to let
other people discourage you.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.837 align:middle line:84%
Some people let
other people say,

00:13:44.837 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, you couldn't
have seen that,

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.253 align:middle line:84%
or you couldn't have--
you know, da, da, da.

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I would say,
believe in what you have seen

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and what you've experienced.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
If you did experience
this, it's a good thing.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> There was no confusion.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.270 align:middle line:90%
This was not a dream.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:10%
This was my real experience
of my soul outside of my body,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:10%
outside of my personality,
outside of my ego,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:10%
and outside of my
human form having

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:10%
a real experience at what I
call the source of all energy,

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:10%
and all spirit from
which we all come.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Just when I say I've
been in the light

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and experienced all
knowledge where there's

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
nothing but love and light
and truth and peace and grace,

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
there's still not enough when
you add all the words together

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to fully describe
what I experienced.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It was more real
than this reality.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We all remember that
experience better

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:90%
than anything else in our life.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It is embedded in us.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It is burned into our mind,
because it was more real.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So for people,
how to believe it?

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
They always want me
to give them that one.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:90%
How to believe it?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Walk a mile in my shoes?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Go have your own
near-death experience?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Here, let me get a gun.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.335 align:middle line:84%
We'll shoot you and see
if you die, you know?

00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we can't do that.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
So they want to know like I do.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I was lucky to be killed.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Think about what I'm saying.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky to be
killed and then

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to come back so that I
could say all of this

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and know all of this.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my sense about
near-death experience is

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
the same as when I hear a
story about psychic experience

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
or mystical experience, or in
fact, any strange experience.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, it is
somebody's actual experience,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:84%
so you need to listen to
it carefully and compare it

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
against other
people's experiences.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Then the question is
if it's very strange,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't happen
very often, you

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have to figure out how to
interpret what it means.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people will interpret
a near-death experience

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
as meaning that
they have literally

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:84%
separated from their
body in some way

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and the identification
of who they are

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:90%
is no longer like this.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
A spirit, a soul,
something like that.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been very difficult
to do scientific research

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
on these kinds of
experiences because it's not

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
ethical to try to induce
a near-death experience.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to
happen spontaneously,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
so it's very difficult to know
when it's going to happen.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there are
instances in which people claim

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to separate from their
body and they can correctly

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
describe things from other
positions, other places.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when I become more
interested, because those

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:90%
are things that can be tested.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
to have somebody

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
in a near-death condition
in order to test it.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So what we have focused on,
what my research focuses on

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
mostly is people who
are not near death,

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
but just completely
ordinary states

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
who are asked, for example,
to describe something

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:90%
at a distance or that is hidden.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have pretty good evidence
that people can do that.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:10%
>> For me to share with you that
I have perfect memory of every

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:10%
experience I had in the
tunnel and in the light

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:10%
and in my conversation with
God, and that I remember it

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:10%
as clearly as I'm talking to
you now is not able to be proven

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:10%
scientifically, because our
understanding of the word

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:10%
memory is that it
is in the brain.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And the brain was in the body,
and the body was in the car.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So no, I cannot prove to you
scientifically how I can have

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
perfect memory of
this experience.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In standard practice
in neurosurgery,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
the belief is that the brain
creates a consciousness.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a thing we're
taught in grade school,

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that the brain makes
the consciousness.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The truth is-- and physics is
coming up against this one big

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:90%
time now--

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the truth is that the
consciousness makes the brain,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and not the other way around.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The brain is just
like a television set.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a receiving station.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
exists outside the body.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
your consciousness

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
as existing outside of your
body but telling itself

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.615 align:middle line:84%
that the locus of your
consciousness is in your head,

00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
so then you're going to
experience everything

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
inside of the body, then
you can see how easy

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:90%
it is to go out of body.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
You just shift where
you're thinking it is.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:90%
You say, OK.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.172 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer in this computer.

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm out here in this one.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Click.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm out there.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Now I can look down on my body.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I want to make my locus
back inside the head, click.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm back in here.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we demonstrate that
consciousness is non-local?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And by that, meaning that
you can gain information

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
from a distance
in space or time?

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes, because
we can do experiments to test

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:90%
whether that is possible.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that if
you dispassionately

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
look at the evidence
that is available,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
then you will find
that the answer is yes,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
or at least that we have high
confidence that the answer is

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
yes, and people can
gain information

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
from a distance
in space or time.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe consciousness
requires the thing

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that we call the brain in order
to be aware, and maybe not.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:10%
Maybe any sufficiently
complex system would do,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know yet.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And since science does not
yet know how to explain all

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
this, there are many experiences
which are very similar to how

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
we felt when you and I tried
to decide if the Earth was flat

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
or round, and science could
not yet prove one or the other.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Or when we tried to
decide if the Earth went

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
around the sun or the sun
went around the Earth,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
because science could not
describe one or the other

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
to our left frontal
lobe's satisfaction.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That is where we now are in this
description of our experiences

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:90%
out of our body.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless we know what
consciousness is or awareness,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:90%
then we can't explain anything.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So then it changes
the question from,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
how do I become
aware of what I'm

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
capable of at an
unconscious level?

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And the traditional
answer to that,

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
which I think is probably
the safest method,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:90%
is through meditation.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So meditation in many ways is
all about getting in contact

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
with your unconscious.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You get to deeper and deeper
levels of awareness about

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you reach
a level of awareness

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.475 align:middle line:84%
where we might say that somebody
would become extremely psychic.

00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.365 align:middle line:84%
In the case of a near-death
experience in particular,

00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
all of those people
by definition

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
come back, so their brains
couldn't have been too dead.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Just dead enough to be
declared near death.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't know what would
happen if a person actually

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.975 align:middle line:90%
dies and doesn't come back.

00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
the answer is.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We all leave in
many different ways,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:90%
but it's very similar, you know?

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
The sleeping.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that, and
I feel that people

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:84%
feel like they go
into a deep sleep,

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:84%
or there's something that
kind of pulls them out

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.837 align:middle line:84%
of their body right before
the incident happens.

00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a young girl
that was in a car accident.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
remember the reading.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said to the mother that
right in the moment of impact,

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
she actually didn't
feel anything.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
she blacked out,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but on the moment of impact,
it was like something

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:90%
pulled her out of her body.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So her consciousness
and awareness

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of being in the body and
actually experiencing pain

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:84%
or things being
pushed into her body

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:84%
or being in the vehicle on
impact, none of that stuff

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:10%
She had peace and
she didn't experience

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:10%
the pain, although on the
physical side, us as humans,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:10%
we see a car crash
and we see a body

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:10%
and we see a girl who is
mangled or who is injured.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The body does die.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The heart stops beating
and the lungs start moving.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, those of
us who have had

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
any form of being
out of our body

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
are convinced that our soul and
spirit survives and does not

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
die.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.015 align:middle line:90%
In fact, never dies.

00:22:14.015 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Most common what they say
to me is it's like flipping

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.582 align:middle line:90%
a switch.

00:22:23.582 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Poo!

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It's an instantaneous process.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, though,
people have so much fear

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of passing that actually,
they hold on and they grab.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, I
think it can actually

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
make it much more difficult
if there's a lot of fear

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
around the actual passing.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've actually helped my
father in his 90s and my mother

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:90%
in her 90s.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:10%
Both understand
with my guarantee

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:10%
where they are
going with no fear,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.665 align:middle line:10%
and it has helped
them leave in peace.

00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:84%
The very first experience I
had in my first near-death

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
experience when I left the
automobile was exactly what I

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
call almost a human desire
to reach those that I loved

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and who loved me, and
let them know that, yes,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I had just left the body, but
I was in such peace and grace

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and light and love
that they should have

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:90%
no anxiety about where I am.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They can have human sadness
that I've left that form,

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and they should have no
sadness about where I am.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
That was the very
first thing I wished

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:90%
I could communicate to them.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you understand from
the near-death experience that

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife is real, then
you will want to maybe talk

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to your relatives who
are sitting over there,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:84%
ones who are passed
on, the ones you love.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Your grandmother,
things like that.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
When you start wanting
to talk to them

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and you do talk to them,
things begin to change.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you want
to know your relatives.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:90%
They do love you.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.972 align:middle line:90%
They're still over there.

00:24:06.972 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> My own mother's
passing in April of 2012,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I stood right beside my mother
when my mother passed away.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And within an hour of
my mother's passing,

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:10%
my mother spoke to me.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:90%
She told me, I've made it.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:90%
I've crossed over.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:10%
So I heard it as clear as day.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many
people that either

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
because of their experiences
out in the light after

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
their near-death experience, or
many people without having had

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
a crisis called a
near-death experience,

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
do have enormous access to
their sensitivity and intuition

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and clairvoyance and ability
to see clearly and feel clearly

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
other entities that
have left the body form,

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
but are still with us.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
So I am very open to it.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no conflict
between the experience

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I've had in the light and that.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it enhances
my belief and trust.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people want to know,
what are the signs, you know?

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:90%
My mother passed away.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:90%
My father passed away.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I've been praying.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I want them to come to let
me know that they're OK,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
that they're at peace.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the mercy of the
spirit that comes through.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They show me what
they want me to see.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
If they want me to know
that they were overweight

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and they had a belly,
they will show me

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that if they feel like it's
relevant to what the person

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
needs to hear or know.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a woman come
to me at a psychic fair.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:10%
And when she
approached my table,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:10%
she looked as if she had
been emotionally beaten.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:10%
She looked very distraught.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:10%
She looked very
tired, very worn down.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
When she sat down
in front of me,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I instantly felt the presence
of her mother and father

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:90%
come in on my right.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I felt the presence
of her daughter

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and her husband
come in on my left.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So I told her, ma'am, I
feel your mother and father

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
on my right in spirit,
and I feel your daughter

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and your husband file
in in spirit on my left.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And she says to me, my husband
just died two weeks ago.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as
she said that, I

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:84%
hear him say to me
very emphatically,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
tell her, tell her I heard her
the last four days of my life.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So I said, ma'am,
your husband wants

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
you to know very emphatically
that he heard you the last four

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
days of his life.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And my client just
burst into tears.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my husband
was in a coma the last four

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
days of his life, and boy,
did I do a lot of talking.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I forgave for everything
that needed forgiven.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I asked forgiveness
for everything

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
that needed to be forgiven.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.635 align:middle line:84%
And I told my husband
that I loved him.

00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And until this moment, I
didn't know he heard me.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I literally watched
50 pounds of weight

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:90%
come off my client's shoulders.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:90%
She lit up.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
She released all
of that struggle.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.944 align:middle line:84%
All that guilt and worry
was just gone instantly.

00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:22.373 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.373 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So I always tell
people, have an open mind.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
But also, whatever comes
through, if it's true for you

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.465 align:middle line:84%
and it resonates,
then hold onto that.

00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:90%
That's your evidence.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what you need, you know?

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't need going to
go down a long list of 100

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
different things for you to
finally get it and believe.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.602 align:middle line:84%
Because my job isn't to convince
you that there's an afterlife

00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
or that I'm really psychic
or that I can really

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:90%
pick up on things.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
My job is to just
be the messenger

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.312 align:middle line:84%
and to let you know
that they're with you,

00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to let you know
that there's things

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.812 align:middle line:84%
that they're bringing
through that they're simply

00:27:59.812 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging so you know that
it's really them, because only

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.355 align:middle line:84%
they would know because
they're close to you.

00:28:04.355 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:90%
They're connected to you.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> A medium's experience is
they're experience is that

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
they're talking
to a dead person.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.792 align:middle line:84%
But we know that our
experience is a construction.

00:28:15.792 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's what's going on.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's not
what's going on.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So people who want to believe
that we survive bodily death,

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:90%
they don't like what I'm saying.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't like the uncertainty.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
They would much rather
have absolute certainty

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that something
continues to survive.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that,
and I have sympathy

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:90%
with that approach as well.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But I can't go there, and I
don't have that certainty.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:84%
However, one thing I
can't say is about mediums

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that I'm convinced
by the data that when

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
a medium is gaining information
that the information is not

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
chance, and it's not
techniques like cold reading.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Now they could be used.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.107 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are fraudulent
mediums do, who will do that.

00:28:59.107 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But the mediums who
are legitimate and good

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:90%
can get real information.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
knowing something

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
about psychic
phenomena, I'm assuming

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that what they're doing is very
similar to what a psychic does.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm right.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm not right.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's my assumption.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, mind
reading, mentality things,

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:90%
telepathics come here.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, this comes right up
through the center of my being.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
something that I will hear.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I will do
this in the course

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of reading to try to adjust
my ability to perceive.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a few cases where
it begins to stretch what we

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.780 align:middle line:84%
understand about
psychic ability,

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and those cases typically
involve a skill on the part

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of the medium that they say that
they're getting from somebody

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
else or something's
working through them,

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
a skill that is complicated
like speaking another language

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:84%
or being able to play chess,
something of that sort.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Which doesn't seem to fit what
we know about psychic ability

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> This happens all the time
in the course of readings.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll say something, and
I'll notice when I say it,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
those aren't the normal
words that I would

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.385 align:middle line:90%
use to convey this thought.

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the person across from
the table from me is going,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:90%
oh my God.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what
my dad would say.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what
my mother would say.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So they're not my words.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.295 align:middle line:90%
They're words of spirit.

00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter who I've talked to,
even when I've talked to people

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that are not open spiritually
or have open minds,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.790 align:middle line:84%
they still have a sense that
their loved one is still with

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They can't explain it.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk to people
all the time that say,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I know.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I just know my
mother's still with me,

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
know that forever.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.722 align:middle line:84%
Or I know my father's
still with me.

00:31:00.722 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
This is something we've
always been able to do.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:90%
We just forgot.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And then we're afraid.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
We block it out.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
For religious reasons, we think
that it's evil or negative.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And so our conscious
mind blocks it out.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But then when we begin to
remember the nature of who

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
we are and connect to our
heart again and meditate,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
then we open up to
these subtle energies

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to really
realize that there's

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.035 align:middle line:84%
so much more to life
than the physical world.

00:31:28.035 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I have had experiences
with other deceased entities,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.260 align:middle line:84%
like we call them ghosts
that have appeared.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most
amazing one happened

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
when I moved into
an apartment and I

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
could feel the energy of
somebody that was very anxious.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long
story short, I

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
discovered later after
the owners of the building

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
told us the truth
instead of lied to us

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that the man who had
killed himself there

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
because his wife
had died of cancer

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
was the entity, the spirit
that was still hanging around

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
with anxiety.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Because when he killed
himself, there was ambivalence,

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and his anxiety was still there.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And at 5:30 every
afternoon, it came

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
rushing out of the
kitchen, down the hall,

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.990 align:middle line:90%
toward the living room.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel that
was not my anxiety.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anxiety
as strong as I felt.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And my one-year-old
daughter one day

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
not only felt it but
saw it the way children

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:90%
can see and screamed, you know?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And I had to hold her.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to this
entity and said,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:90%
you stay away from my daughter!

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And so your energy's OK here.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:90%
I can handle it, but she can't.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they exist pretty
much around the same level

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:90%
as we do.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Physically, we have a certain
molecular makeup, you know?

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a crust and you
can feel the person.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that
every level of existence

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.470 align:middle line:90%
is like that.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like a frequency.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like the radio, you know?

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the radio waves,
but there are lots of them,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and you can tune into
different channels or stations

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.837 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:33:20.837 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's right here where we are.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a different frequency
in the same place we are.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
When they're in that
fourth dimension,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.173 align:middle line:90%
they're almost at our frequency.

00:33:27.173 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:90%
That's why they can see us.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We can't see them,
but they can see us.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they can see us.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And some of us can see them.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe all of us have
the ability to see them.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
believe in them or we

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
choose not to activate them,
they're not going to work.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But it is very clear in
Corinthians in the Bible

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that all men are given equally,
liberally of these gifts

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:90%
as much as he would will.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I now know or believe based
on my own experience that there

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is much that we cannot
see, but we can feel.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear things like
the string theory and others

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.179 align:middle line:84%
and quantum physics,
all of it are

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:84%
examples of science beginning
to understand and to explain

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
what until now has never
been able to be explained.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What's important about
quantum mechanics is that

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
it's the best physical
theory that we have.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:84%
It describes the physical world
as accurately as any theory

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:84%
that we've been able
to develop so far.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:90%
So we're physical creatures.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:90%
We live in a physical world.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Physics has to be
compatible at least

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:84%
with the kinds of phenomena
we're talking about.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
claims that they can

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:84%
project their mind somewhere
and get information

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
from a distance, physics
has to allow that.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, it
doesn't make any sense.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So up until perhaps
100 years ago

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
with classical physics
as the best description,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't any way that
physics would even allow

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%
for these kinds of phenomena.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere about 100
years ago, a little bit more

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:84%
now, the idea of multiple
dimensions came along.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And so people doing my
kind of work suddenly

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.730 align:middle line:84%
became very interested
in the possibility

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
dimensions here.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Like you go to
CERN, for example,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the particle
physicists who are beginning

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, based on
things like the standard model

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
in physics, how do we explain
why when you mash together

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.130 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of protons
or neutrons, why

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
do you get the result that you
get of a bunch of particles?

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of those
theories require

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that you'd need more than
three dimensions of space

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and one of time in
order to describe it.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you begin to find
out these other dimensions.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics are much simpler
when you deal with higher order

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.995 align:middle line:84%
dimensions than if you imagine
that all there actually was

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.600 align:middle line:84%
was three dimensions of
space and one of time.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's where the
comfort comes from in physics.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics say,
well, there ought

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to be 11 dimensions
because then everything

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:90%
kind of works really nice.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you
to predict that if you

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.660 align:middle line:84%
take certain hunks of matter
and you mash them together,

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that the behavior of that should
look a certain way with 11

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, but it would look
very different with three.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And physics says we have
seven levels in string theory

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and one more level in M-theory
for a total of 11 dimensions.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Those eight extra dimensions,
which we have not discerned,

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
are the dark energy, the 96% of
the universe that we cannot yet

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:84%
even detect, but we know
mathematically that it's there

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:90%
from our astronomy.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.370 align:middle line:84%
We know that the dark
energy and the dark matter

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:84%
exist and make up
96% of the universe,

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:90%
which we don't yet see.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of room
for a lot of afterlife

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of different
levels out there.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But the materialist
scientists who only want 3D,

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:90%
they won't look at it.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.555 align:middle line:84%
They say, no, it's
a bunch of baloney.

00:37:06.555 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't even look.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:08.388 align:middle line:90%
They just say, no good.

00:37:08.388 --> 00:37:09.188 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:37:09.188 --> 00:37:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going
to look at it.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.205 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do they
know it's impossible?

00:37:12.205 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They see 4% of the universe and
the rest of it's impossible.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
But that's ridiculous.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember
that it's not in our 4%.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:90%
We can't know it all yet.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But we're now at a point
where we are making beachheads

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:31.435 align:middle line:84%
on a new territory,
those other dimensions.

00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if when you're a
scientist working on the edge

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of the known, if you really
require certainty to feel

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.290 align:middle line:84%
comfortable, you're
in the wrong business,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:84%
because most of the time,
you begin to recognize when

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you're studying over the
edge of what is known,

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows what's going on.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:90%
For me, that's exciting.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't mind that
we don't understand it.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is, how do
we become clever enough

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to study
that unknown space

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and begin to understand it.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The quarks and the gluons
which make up our atoms,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
string theory is that they're
made up of a vibration.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And you think about a vibration
without a string vibrating.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you have what quarks
and gluons are made out of,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:90%
a thought.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:90%
A vibratory thought.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's consciousness.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
the whole universe.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, if consciousness
comes first,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:84%
then this whole idea
that the neurosurgeons

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:84%
are using, that the brain, the
wet brain creates the thought,

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.720 align:middle line:90%
is bullshit.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Science does not
have an explanation yet.

00:38:35.087 --> 00:38:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we think
about it, what does it

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:90%
mean to have an explanation?

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
In science, what
that typically means

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:90%
is we want a causal explanation.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.965 align:middle line:84%
We want to know
that this interacts

00:38:43.965 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
with that and that
interacts with this,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and they have a causal sequence
that explains how things work.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So from that perspective,
we have no idea.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
psychic abilities work.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But we also don't know
how consciousness works.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
explanations for that either.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We're still very young creatures
and science is too new.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think about other
planets out there

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that may be a billion
years ahead of us.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.920 align:middle line:84%
They probably know
a little bit more

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:84%
than we do if there are people
who are scientists there.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And they would look
back at us, what

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to do now
and say, these creatures

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
don't have any idea
what's going on.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the really
fundamental questions that we

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:84%
would have about life and us and
the planet and universe and all

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, which are all
very interesting questions,

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.350 align:middle line:84%
we have some answers, but
it's just barely begun.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And all scientists
learn very quickly

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.095 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
things you don't talk about.

00:39:37.095 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't push against the
social environment in science,

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because if you do,
you won't have a job.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to
do what you want to do.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So it is no different than in
politics or in any other domain

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of human affairs.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.728 align:middle line:84%
We learn that there are
certain things you talk about

00:39:54.728 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:90%
and certain things you don't.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I know when I say I'm a
medium that all the other

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
scientists look at me like,
he is not a scientist.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:90%
He's a nut.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:90%
That's.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:90%
OK I'm retired.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't care anymore.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:90%
They still have their career.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.908 align:middle line:84%
They're still worried
about everyone else

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:84%
thinking they're
crazy, you know?

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So they are careful
about saying things.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But more of them should have
a little more courage and say,

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know everything.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying it's
impossible, they should look.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in physics,
and I'm a naval architect.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I've designed many ships.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:10%
And I know all about
how to use physics

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:10%
in our 3D to make things work.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that that's just
a little corner of the world,

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:45.015 align:middle line:84%
and that the huge universe
out here decides that.

00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And this huge universe, we
don't know anything about.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And I can stand up there.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:84%
If the guys who want to
hide in the 4% little corner

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:90%
want to laugh at me, let them.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.140 align:middle line:90%
They're the fools.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the fool.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I realize we don't know.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Most scientists tend
to be pretty smart,

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and the smarter you are, the
easier it is to fall in love

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:90%
with a theory.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And theories are explanations.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.400 align:middle line:84%
They make us feel
comfortable in the world.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you spend your
entire adult life learning

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
about a certain description of
the way that the world works,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.800 align:middle line:84%
you become
comfortable with that.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you begin to
see the world in those terms.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.505 align:middle line:84%
I happen to have
a lot of friends

00:41:23.505 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:84%
who are theorists
who can only see

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:90%
the world through their theory.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So it is that combined also
with a certain social taboo

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:84%
about what you're allowed
to talk about in science

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and what you're not.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And taboos are interesting,
because I mean,

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:84%
by definition, this is
what you can talk about

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you
can't talk about.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, why can't we
talk about this?

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a whole
topic unto itself.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Why are we not allowed to
address fundamental questions

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:10%
about who we are?

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Younger scientists have grown
up in a very different kind

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of context, and
especially people

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.380 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to
surprises and strange things

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.092 align:middle line:84%
about quantum mechanics
and the physical world.

00:42:11.092 --> 00:42:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
beginning to loosen up

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
people's previous
assumptions about,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.780 align:middle line:84%
what do we actually
know about physicality?

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And that alone could be
enough to eventually change

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
how people feel about
these topics as well.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness
studies 30 years ago

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
was just beginning
to become popular,

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and then it went
into a quiet period,

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and now it's coming
back much bigger.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
You see conferences on
consciousness everywhere

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and an academic can
study consciousness

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and they don't lose their job.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:84%
That's happening around the
world, so that is a big change.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a huge change
in human consciousness now

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:84%
compared to the past, and
it continues to change.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And now that we are beginning
to talk more openly about it,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
then we are better able to
hear and understand and believe

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
other people's experiences and
talk more ourselves about it.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And that change is
happening very quickly.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's true that because
of a rising interest

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness studies
said some of it is science,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but a large part of it is also
scholarship and philosophy.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So there are many different
ways of getting into this topic.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes philosophers
and scientists

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.332 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
talk to each other,

00:43:29.332 --> 00:43:31.388 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes scholars
and historians

00:43:31.388 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:84%
are talking about something
completely different.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.875 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a big and important topic,
and so you have conferences

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of
people, all coming at it

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:84%
from slightly different
angles, which I take actually

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.950 align:middle line:84%
as a good sign, because
it means it's not

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.880 align:middle line:84%
likely to collapse prematurely
into, this is the way to do it.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complicated topic,
which makes it interesting

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and also challenging
to figure out,

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.900 align:middle line:90%
what's the best way to study it?

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.975 align:middle line:90%
And maybe there is no best way.

00:43:57.975 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
their own best way.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> My experience in the light
enabled me to feel a deeper

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:84%
sense of spirituality, less
defined by any one religion

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:90%
or another.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So all religions in my
opinion and experience

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:84%
have true spirituality
at the core,

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and all religions to different
degrees and in different ways

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:84%
are guilty of a form
of righteousness

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that has the details
of their description

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:84%
be perceived of as
the correct ones,

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and the others the wrong ones.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So the more we come
together as one

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and realize the
common goals we have

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and listen to each other's
spirituality in whatever we

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:57.100 align:middle line:84%
believe, actually, we will
start to learn that at the core,

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:84%
we are all feeling and believing
mostly the same things,

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and that the details
that are different

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:84%
aren't actually so
important that they deserve

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:90%
killing one another over them.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say we're
experiencing a spiritual

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:90%
revolution.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:84%
70% of Americans do believe
that there's an afterlife.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Around 35%, 40% truly
believe in mediums being

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.630 align:middle line:90%
able to talk to the other side.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:31.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I have seen a tremendous
increase in the last two years,

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:10%
but I noticed the increase
probably about five to eight

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:10%
years ago begin.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
People are awakening
and seeing more.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And especially in children
who are being born today,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.640 align:middle line:10%
they're being born much more
perceptive, much more psychic,

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:10%
much more clairvoyant,
much more empathic

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.920 align:middle line:10%
than they've ever been before.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:10%
My belief, my hope is that it is
to improve those circumstances

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.710 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth plane, to bring
us back to love so that we

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:10%
can better help one another.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that that
experience necessarily changes

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:16.250 align:middle line:84%
you per se into a person who's
selfless and helpful and all

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that, you know?

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And good and whatever like that.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I think people have been having
that experience for centuries.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But they may or may not
have gotten more enlightened

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.570 align:middle line:90%
afterward.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, they would be.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of nice to think
that the world would someday

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.160 align:middle line:84%
turn into a place
that people would

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:90%
want to stay and want to live.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that I
guess we're in the world

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:84%
because we are supposed
to be presented

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.400 align:middle line:84%
with problems to
solve, and that's

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.840 align:middle line:90%
the way we're trying to do it.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people have
wounds in their heart,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and those wounds in their heart
make them feel more separate

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:53.430 align:middle line:90%
than more connected.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people feel like it's

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:84%
a race to make the most money,
to have the biggest house,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.630 align:middle line:84%
to have all these external
things that none of us

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.430 align:middle line:90%
really need.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's a part
of them and there's

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.087 align:middle line:84%
a part of us that
believes we need

00:47:09.087 --> 00:47:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that to be happy, to have joy.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.700 align:middle line:84%
When people ask me
questions, well,

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.430 align:middle line:84%
why do people suffer
if we all have angels?

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Why do people suffer?

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Why do bad things happen?

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:84%
We all have free will
and we all have a choice.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to be angry, or
we can choose to be at peace.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:30.720 align:middle line:90%
None of us are alone.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we really knew
who stood beside us

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and behind us and in front of
us, we'd never fear anything.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:84%
We'd never be afraid
to go after our dreams

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and live our best life and take
that chance and take that risk.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.847 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be afraid
that we didn't have money

00:47:47.847 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to do the things
that we wanted to do.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.972 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be afraid
to do anything.

00:47:50.972 --> 00:47:54.945 align:middle line:84%
We'd be more fearless and we
would walk with blind faith,

00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:57.320 align:middle line:84%
just knowing that everything
was always going to work out

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and that we'd be OK.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.850 align:middle line:10%
>> As my friend and spiritual
teacher who passed away would

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:08.330 align:middle line:10%
say to me, every moment, every
breath is a moment of creation.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people get so caught in
the process of, oh, I want this

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and I want this and I want this,
and then it doesn't show up

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.290 align:middle line:84%
immediately so then
they're like, well,

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.990 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to happen.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, every moment, every
thought, every breath

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.550 align:middle line:90%
is a creation.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got five minutes
of moving toward it,

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, oh, well,
it's not going to happen,

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.500 align:middle line:90%
you just shut it down.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I tell my
clients that as well.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I can predict, but I
can't make it happen.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you come to
me for a reading,

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I give you a snapshot of
what I see as possibility.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's up to the
client to create it.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:90%
We project our own energy.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had a day
that just started out

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to be the absolute
worst day, and you

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:84%
were in the absolute worst
mood, and it just progressed

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:09.020 align:middle line:90%
through the entire day?

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.370 align:middle line:84%
That's because your energy's
progressing negativity.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:90%

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:84%
If you can stop, take a
breath, refresh, and refocus--

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I tell people, turn on your GPS.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Turn on your GPS.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.830 align:middle line:10%
When you get up in the morning,
when your feet hit the floor,

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.950 align:middle line:10%
you state what you
want your day to be.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Just believe in yourself and
what you see and what you know.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing
something good

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and trying to be good and
beneficial to the world,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.430 align:middle line:84%
then the pit things people
say, they're not real.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I
usually say, you know?

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Just believe in what you
have as your own intuition.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There are only two
ways, fear and love.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.770 align:middle line:90%
The rest doesn't exist.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And fear is false.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We use False Evidence
Appearing Real.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:84%
F-E-A-R. False evidence
appearing to be real.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what fear is.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not real at all.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Fears are based on nothing.
