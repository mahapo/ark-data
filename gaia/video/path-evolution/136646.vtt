>> This is Robert Monroe
speaking from the Monroe

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Institute of Applied Sciences.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330 align:middle line:84%
This is one of a series that has
been released by the Institute

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:90%
upon the request of many.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Many who believe
that such information

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
needs to be part of
man's general knowledge.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The following is made up
of material taken directly

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
from the voice tracks of
"Explorer" sessions held here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:90%
at our research facility.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
We offer them without
our evaluation or comment

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
so that you can learn
from them as we did

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and form your own interpretation
or analysis of what took place.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
The explorer is lying
in total darkness

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
on a water bed in our
experimental Isolation Booth 2.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The booth itself is well
shielded from RF radiation

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and is temperature controlled
and, also, totally soundproof.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
The only signal our
explorer can receive

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
is the audio pattern through
a set of stereo headphones.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
We record out of the
booth her aural responses

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and her body voltages.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Are explorers, as we call
them, are individuals

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
who have learned to move into
other states of consciousness

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
utilizing special
institute methods to do so,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and without the use of drugs
or electrical stimulation.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Most important, each has learned
to comment and report vocally

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
during such states.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It is the recording
of such commentary,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
along with that of the
monitor, that you will hear.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
In this case our explorer is
NKH, a new member of the team.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
She has reached as a
familiar state of awareness

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
where her reporting may or
may not be totally her own.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not accept that nay
fear-based philosophies.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:10%
I have found that
they are all false.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:10%
They're all man-made.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And they're all very restrictive
to our personal development.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And this belief in the end of
the world will occur in 2012

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
is another false
fear-based belief

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:90%
system that will not occur.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been around a while, 35
years, pursuing this quest.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the same thing
was happening at the year 2000.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I was hearing the
same questions.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god, the world's
going to come to an end.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Remember people actually
sold their homes

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
and went up the mountain tops.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It actually happened.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
nothing happened.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And 2012 will be the same.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
People forget that the
evolution of consciousness

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is a purpose for
the physical world.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And the evolution
of consciousness

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%
is occurring according to plan.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's
going to be Utopia.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
We as humans, as consciousness,
we grow through drama.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Call it good, bad, or
indifferent, but people,

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we create drama for training,
for learning purposes.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:90%
It's even the purpose for wars.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
People learn through
drama, through conflict.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
That's just the state of
consciousness we're in.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is the
evolution of consciousness

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
is working.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:90%
There is an opening.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
spiritual development.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of psychological
development occurring

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
throughout the planet.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is not going to
stop in 2012 just because

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
of some archaic belief system.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I would predict clearly that
nothing will occur in 2012 out

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of the norm that already hasn't
occurs on a regular basis--

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
little earthquake
here, or rains.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's all part of the
evolution of consciousness.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
As long as the evolution of
consciousness is occurring,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
there is no reason to stop
the process because we

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:90%
are evolving through form.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And why would that
system that has

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
worked for millions
of years, suddenly

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
stop because of
some belief system?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:90%
To me, it makes no sense.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been taught that
humankind has been evolving.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:10%
That in paleolithic
times, we were

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:10%
essentially living on what we
call the first chakra, that's

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:10%
survival.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It was also very connected to
the divine, very instinctive,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:90%
very basic way of living.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we evolved in Neolithic
times up to the second chakra.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:90%
This is about fertility.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We began to learn to plant
seeds and grow crops.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It was beginning to take
control of our lives

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
by being able to provide
food for ourselves when

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
we needed it.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So we relied less on the
divine and more on ourselves.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a wave of culture
that came down from the Russian

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Steppes into the Middle
East, which is considered

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
the cradle of civilization.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And it brought in patriarchy.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.232 align:middle line:84%
Neolithic culture
was very egalitarian.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered how could you
possibly tell that so long ago

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:90%
that nothing was written?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
They tell by what is left in
graves, how the graves were.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So that men and
women were the same.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
There didn't seem to be
anybody who was elevated

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:90%
higher than anybody else.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
There were no larger
graves full of more stuff,

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
like the Egyptian
pyramids, for example.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Their rulers were
considered gods

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were buried in these
huge pyramids with a great deal

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of accoutrement and wealth
to take into their next life

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That's hierarchy.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
That came in with patriarchy
thousands of years

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
ago when the Neolithic
cultures were

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
decimated over a period
of about 2,000 years.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
They were just wiped out.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of
egalitarian living.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we have patriarchy
and hierarchy.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I think with 2012 coming, we
are shifting we are moving up

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to the heart chakra.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We are going from a
power, a place of power

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
over, win-lose, we're
going to be moving up

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:90%
to heart, to win-win.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't going to be
the same kind of struggle.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
That whatever we do, we
do for the good of all,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
not just for ourselves.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And that involves clearing ego.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Living in this third
chakra has been ego driven,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:90%
caring for me first, me only.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I got to take care of
myself, nobody else will.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Up to trust, faith,
belief in love.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we all love
one another, we

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.996 align:middle line:84%
want the best for
one another, we're

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be moving
to a different level

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that 2012
is the end of an era.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It is at the end of
life as we knew it.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean the Earth's
going to blow up.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we're going
to be wiped out by an asteroid.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:90%
The Mayan calendar ends in 2012.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the end of a
period of life structure.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are so
many traumatic things going

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
on on the planet right now.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:10%
It's 2008.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:10%
Think about it.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:10%
What more drastic can happen
in the next four years?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:10%
We're going to have some
more physical storms,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:10%
are part of Armageddon.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is shaking
off a lot of the old stuff.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have some more
disasters like that, I'm sure.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be up to the
planet as a whole to help

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:90%
the people who get in trouble.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean we saw what happened
with Hurricane Katrina.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
We saw that we didn't
mobilize as well as we should

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:90%
have to help those people.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We saw what happened
with the tsunami.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Other things like
this are happening.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
These are all part of the
upheaval of the planet

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's up to us
as humans to do

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
what we can to help every
single person on this planet.

And I believe we are
in the midst of it.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So the year itself,
I don't think

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
is going to be as traumatic,
as shocking, as we think it is.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a process
rather than a one event

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%
kind of a deal.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it's
going to be fine.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%

some kind of a shift that is

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
happening in terms
of consciousness.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:10%
Just the simple fact
that it's becoming

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:10%
more of our conversation.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And consciousness itself is
becoming a very, very hot

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:10%
topic, not just in
science, but in general.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:90%
So I think there is a shift.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And from my own
personal experience,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I have found a shift of--

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
as I was a trainer, when
I first started training,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and even when I first started
coming here as a participant,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the groups and the type of
people who are coming here

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
seem to hold a
greater wisdom, maybe,

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
or a greater maturity
that from my perspective

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:90%
has been pretty profound.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think
there is some kind

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of a change that's happening.

its dimensions are

to end in 2012, I don't know.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that whatever
happens between now

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and then, we've got
a lot of work to do.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And the work that we do
here is very significant.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
something really dramatic

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
happens in 2012, the type
of work that we do here

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
can't help but
prepare us for that.

To communicate with you, I've
got to start where you are.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.373 align:middle line:10%
I've got to start with your
beliefs, your understanding,

So that's a challenge to
communicate with people.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:84%

an image of being rational so

actually listen to you.

to experience and think?

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.122 align:middle line:84%

have to get exposure.

you get, the more

that what we're
going to talk about

will barely dent the surface
of what Tom talks about

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:10%
in his book.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a moment, talk out
sort of start at the beginning.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:10%
I kind of have an idea that
it began in your childhood.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was very young--

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm guessing maybe
six, seven years old--

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:10%
I had what I learned later to
call out-of-body experiences.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't know that
term at that time.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:10%
A presence, you might
say an entity, came to me

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:10%
and basically helped
me get out of body,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:10%
then taught me how
to do it myself.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:10%
And I went through a series
of probably a couple of years

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:10%

distinguished guest

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:10%
which is Thomas Campbell.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:10%
And Thomas is a nuclear
physicist, as well as

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:10%
he's written a book on
consciousness called "My Big

TOE."

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to go back to
some of the main concepts

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:10%
that we talked about in our
last interview last week, really

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:10%
just to expand on.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:10%
Because some of our
listeners, including myself,

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:10%
may not have been as aware of
some of your major concepts

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:10%
which is about consciousness,
data, and metaphors.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:10%
You know, I thought
about, OK, so I've

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:10%
heard that our eyes
don't actually see

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:10%
and our ears don't
actually hear.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really the input that
goes to our brain that

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
allows us to see and to hear.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that
sense, that's data.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself
as a consciousness

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that is receiving a data
stream of information.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And that information
defines for you

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
your reality, what you see
and hear and smell and touch.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And the best analogy
you kind of get a grip--

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
this is something that's very
hard to get an intuitive feel

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but the best analogy is a
computer simulation game.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And think of it in
the same way as that.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
We're the characters in this
computer simulation game.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
There you have lots
of people interacting.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They see things.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
They do things.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
They interact.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:10%
And when they go up and interact
with whether it's other player

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's a
monster, things happen.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:10%
It's all an interactive thing.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And there's rules.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
In these games, they
tend to be violent games.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So the rules are how many whacks
can you take before you die

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
or how many hit
points and how much

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
this and how much
that and magic spells.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
And all of these are
part of their rules.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's just a rule set.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And it creates a world.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Well our world is
very much like that.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Think of consciousness as
the fundamental reality.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:90%
We are consciousness.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is digital.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So it deals with data.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Data with rules
creates realities.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:90%
This is our reality.

there's a dozen of them

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:10%
out there, and there's
thousands of players.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And they have characters.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And the characters go
where they tell them to go.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:10%
But there's also
things they interact

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:10%
with that are part of the set.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's all digital.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:10%
It's a virtual reality.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's the same sort
of thing that our reality is.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:10%
This physical reality
is a virtual reality.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:10%
And it is based on information
just as that World of Warcraft

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:10%
is based on information.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:10%
It's information 1s and
0's traveling around

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:10%
in that server that makes all
those people do what they do.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:10%
And they have their
battles and they

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.532 align:middle line:10%
go through a lot of actions,
interact, gain experience.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.240 align:middle line:10%
>> But at some point
in that interaction,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:10%
there must be
discreet interaction.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm asking is
what determines the outcome

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:10%
of those discrete interactions?

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:10%

outcome is free will.

That's another part
of consciousness.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have consciousness
without free will.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:90%
They go together.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:90%
They're a matched set.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:10%
You have to be able to make
good decisions and bad decisions

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:10%
or you wouldn't have free will.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.764 align:middle line:10%
So it's up to us.

00:19:14.764 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can take a few steps
forward and a few steps

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.135 align:middle line:84%
backward, and you
hope that in the end,

00:19:20.135 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
there is more forward
than there is backward.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
And then you're making progress.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
a simple thing.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:10%
Maybe we should step
back a bit and say

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:10%
that this system that
I'm calling the larger

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:10%
system of reality, of which
this physical reality is

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:10%
a subsystem, this larger
system is consciousness.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:10%
So then dot dot dot, we'd
end up with consciousness is

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:10%
a digital information system.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, in order for
consciousness to evolve,

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:10%
it evolves towards
states of lower entropy.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:10%
Now your listeners may
not understand that,

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.166 align:middle line:10%
but it evolves toward states
of greater capability,

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:10%
let's put it that
way, less randomness.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of these
units of consciousness, which

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:90%
we'll call entities or beings.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
They come in all
sizes and shapes.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now of course sizes
is a physical word.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.892 align:middle line:84%
There's no size
to consciousness.

00:20:19.892 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
There's not a big consciousness
and a little consciousness.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But there are consciousness
that have a lot of data and not

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:90%
so much data.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's
consciousness who have

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
their data very well
organized and have a lot

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.955 align:middle line:90%
of real information in there.

00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness
that have data that's

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of scrambled and noisy
and not very coherent.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And we measure that
coherency of the data

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that forms a consciousness
in terms of entropy.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Entropy is a science word.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
It's really a physics
word from thermodynamics

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that talks about
things being ordered

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and things being useful in
their ability to do something,

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:90%
have some kind of action.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.756 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
lot of entropy, that

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
means you have a
lot of disorder.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.907 align:middle line:90%
It's a measure of disorder.

00:21:05.907 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
If you have very low
entropy, then you

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:90%
have things that are ordered.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:10%
So if you had a whole bunch of
random letters of the alphabet

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:10%
all in a pile, that would
be a high entropy system.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:10%
If you take them
and arrange them

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:10%
some way that it spells
something meaningful to you,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:10%
then that's a much
lower entropy system

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:10%
because there's order
now been put to it.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
something like a body,

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.121 align:middle line:84%
a body is more
ordered because it

00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
has all kinds of cells that
have very specific things to do.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very ordered thing.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Or a crystal that grows in a
very particular way, that's

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:90%
ordered.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.466 align:middle line:90%
Those things have lower entropy.

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Things that have
high entropy are

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:90%
things like your child's room.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:90%
They always have high entropy.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Certainly my child's room
had a lot of high entropy.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Things were very disordered.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, vapors, things that
just move around randomly,

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
they have very high entropy.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about entropy
in terms of systems.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:90%
A system has entropy.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And a low entropy
consciousness is love.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
When consciousness
is very low entropy,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not that it is
loving, it is love.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition of love,
a low entropy consciousness.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when love is
what the being is, then

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that being is basically as
useful and as helpful and as

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
interactive and as
positive, it can do a lot.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of ability to
do work, to change things.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:10%
And how we interact
with each other,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:10%
how we interact with the
set, the physical world,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:10%
gives us opportunities
to make decisions.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:10%
And those decisions
reflect our intent.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And if that intent is a
positive, is a good intent,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:10%
is an intent toward
love, then we evolve.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:10%
If the intent is in the
opposite direction, we devolve.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:10%
So we're here to
experience, to interact.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of a
place to mix it up.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to make
those decisions that

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
exercises our intent
which will help us either

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:90%
evolve or devolve.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Love gives me a
feeling of expansion.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:10%
It gives me, really, a
feeling of elevation, of lift.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:10%
I feel open.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I feel happy.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.355 align:middle line:84%
I feel connected to other
people, to all beings.

00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Fear and hatred are contracting.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They're dense.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:90%
They're heavy.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:90%
They're dark.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I retreat into myself
and to worry about me.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
impact on my body.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
really affects your health.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Feelings of love
speed up your vibration.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:90%
They raise your light quotient.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:90%
They increase your energy field.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Feelings of peace and love
bring you the greatest power

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:90%
that you can have.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:10%
>> When we move into
a place of love,

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:10%
when we move into a place
of higher vibration--

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:10%
and it's not a judgment thing,
it's not positive and negative.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just a higher vibration.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Just like sound,
you have low sounds

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and you have high sounds--

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
when you move into
a place of love,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
you're moving into the
higher sound frequencies

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that are healing, that
can change so many things.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
What it comes down
to is the vibration.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We can change our
vibrations consciously.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
We can have our vibrations
changed by other people.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:84%
When you move into
a room and somebody

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:84%
is in an absolute state of joy
and happiness, it lifts us.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
When you move into
a room and somebody

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is filled with anger and
hate, it brings us down.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:90%
We feel that shift.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything that is
heavy and negative, if--

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in my belief-- you
don't deal with it

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:84%
when it is on a vibrational
level like a thought

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
or an emotion, those
are much easier

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to deal with and correct when
they are on an energetic level.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't pay
attention to them

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and you allow that
density and that heaviness

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to stay in your body, it winds
up affecting you physically.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But fear is the
opposite of love.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we are trying
to grow toward love,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
then fear is what's taking
us in the opposite direction.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:10%
And this doesn't have to be
fear like scream and run away.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:10%
This is fear of not
measuring up, fear

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:10%
of not being good
enough, insecurities,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:10%
all these things are fear,
fear of not being lovable,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:10%
fear of not being competent.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just
fear of bodily harm.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have to be a monster.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:10%
The fear is mainly the monsters
inside that you're afraid of.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear is a big
block of humanity.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:10%
We are all in our own box.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.994 align:middle line:10%
And that box is fear.

00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:10%
We all have our own
little comfort zone.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:10%
But we're all in a box.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm no different.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:84%
My box is just a
little different.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But we're all in our
own self-made box,

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
culturally molded,
but we accepted it.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
like how far are you

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
willing to extend beyond
your little fear barrier?

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Every time you do something
that makes you uncomfortable,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that stretches you,
you're starting

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:90%
to break through that barrier.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is the
walls that you feel.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
When we feel
anxiety in our life,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
we're pressing
against that barrier.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Every fear that we have has to
be overcome in the physical.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, if you have
a fear, you have to overcome it

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:90%
or you just take it with you.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we're here
to learn, to grow,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:10%
to evolve the quality
of our consciousness.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:10%
That's our point and
purpose for being here.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a larger
consciousness system.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:10%
That system is evolving.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And we are evolving
as pieces of it.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.417 align:middle line:84%
So we're here to
grow up basically.

00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose for
a tiger in the woods?

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:90%
What's the tiger's purpose?

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, it evolves right?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:90%
And it grows.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It lives.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It interacts.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It learns.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:90%
It does the same thing.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.405 align:middle line:10%
What's anything's purpose?

00:27:25.405 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Your purpose is to evolve,
to continue, to do better,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:10%
to find better ways of being.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.850 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a virtual reality
field that's very believable.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's incredible
invention this earth plane.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean we believe
we're physical.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We believe we're mammals.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's really
everything that we

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
believe about ourselves is
totally alien to what we truly

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.880 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:90%
But yet it's convincing.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Here, I'm a human man.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a father.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a writer.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm none of these things
at soul, of course.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:90%
All of that is an illusion.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
The point is it's
a virtual reality

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
field where we learn and grow
through personal experience.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And to be effective, we learn
by not only through school,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.125 align:middle line:90%
we learn by being.

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The intellect is a
weak player in this game.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:10%
And growth has to be
from the inside out.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that
somebody will explain to you.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you shouldn't be afraid.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:10%
Let go of your fear.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, those things are easy
to say, but very hard to do.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:10%
It has to be something that
comes up from inside of you.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It has to come
from a deep level.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to, basically, grow
up, which means change yourself.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to be different.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter
of acting different.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.212 align:middle line:84%
Acting different is maybe
a first step, sometimes,

00:29:04.212 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:90%
toward being different.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's not a
first step to anywhere.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You're just acting,
you're playing a role.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:90%
But you have to change yourself.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with
the will to change.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the ability
to see what's going on.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:90%
To be aware that it's fear.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
To be aware of the
source of that fear,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and then to have the courage
to step right into that fear

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and deal with it rather than
use devices to avoid it.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons that we
have this virtual reality where

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the biology is such that we
die is that we go through this

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:90%
learning period.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.812 align:middle line:84%
We get to a point where the rate
of learning maybe slows down.

00:32:12.812 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we've learned
about all we're

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:90%
capable of learning this time.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
You get that been there done
that feeling and you're no

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:84%
longer maybe as open
minded as you were.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's harder to
get new concepts in.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to think out of
the box, that kind of stuff.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that point, if you
just keep on keeping on,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that gets to be
not so productive.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So you want a system that
every so often pulls you out

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of the classroom, lets you
evaluate what you're learning,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
lets you see where you're
going and what your errors are

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and what you need to do better.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Program, plan, another
learning session, and then

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.000 align:middle line:90%
go back and do it again.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole lot more
effective than just learning,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:90%
in just one straight long thing.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do that,
everything you do next

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:90%
is based on what you did before.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't get any
fresh starts that way.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to get out of the box.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:10%
>> The soul can take
on any shape, any form,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:10%
needed to learn and
grow and evolve.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
are all doing here,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:10%
taking on a humanoid form to
learn, and to grow, and evolve,

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.340 align:middle line:10%
.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.097 align:middle line:84%
and then exit that
old form and move on.

00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:32.439 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.439 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If you understand
your consciousness,

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.429 align:middle line:90%
then you're not the body.

00:33:36.429 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
You're something
other than the body.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
That the body is
really just virtual.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a set of rules
to give you experience

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.280 align:middle line:90%
so that you can evolve.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what it is.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now your virtual body
isn't any more alive

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
than the virtual body on
that television screen

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
or that computer screen
in your virtual game.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just a virtual body.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, it abides by
biological rules.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480 align:middle line:90%
So it grows.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:90%
It gets bigger.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:90%
It gets potbelly.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Your hair gets white.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:90%
You get old.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:90%
You die.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.679 align:middle line:84%
So those things happen because
that's part of the rule system.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's just a virtual body.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
In those video games, you can
change your body sometimes.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So some of those characters
can change themselves

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.169 align:middle line:90%
into leopards and horses.

00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And they can change their body.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Or they can just go
get another character

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and play that character.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's sort of like that.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.190 align:middle line:10%
So this reality is
a virtual reality.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:10%
But, say, when Uncle Fred dies
and he's in that other reality,

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:10%
that's a virtual reality, too.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:10%
That's not the reality.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:10%
It's not well we
have the physical one

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:10%
and the nonphysical one in
there that Uncle Fred's in,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:10%
that's the real reality.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:10%
It's not like that.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:10%
That's just another
virtual reality.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Now there is a rule set there.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:90%
There's a physics there.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:84%
There are things you can
do and can't do there.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:90%
And it has its own purpose.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:10%
And the purpose is
basically the same

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:10%
in that it's to help
consciousness evolve,

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:10%
because that's the name
of the game that we're in.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:10%
Now if you are at a very
low level of evolution,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:10%
your consciousness
is high entropy,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:10%
you go out, Yeah,
Yeah, you jump back in.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
planning or whatever,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
because really all you need to
do at that point is just get

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.370 align:middle line:90%
You're new.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You just need to get experience.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So that, there's not much.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:84%
If you are a more evolved,
and by that I just

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
mean a lower entropy
consciousness,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:90%
then you're more particular.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
You take some time, and
you say, well, you know,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm really having
trouble with greed,

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
or I'm really having trouble
with this part of ego and fear

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.339 align:middle line:84%
And what I need is a
situation like this,

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
because that would really give
them the opportunity to learn.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:84%
That would just kind of
draw me out in that area.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So you make plans of what
it is you'd like to do.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways you know
what your problems are

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is that you get
to see and review

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:90%
what you did in that life.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:90%
So you do get a review.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a review
that somebody sits down

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and makes you watch
everything that you did.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:10%
But as you interact
with these people,

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:10%
and these are really
facilitators, if you will,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:10%
and you claim that
something that

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.562 align:middle line:10%
isn't really true
like well, you know,

00:36:19.562 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have any ego in
that life, dah duh, dah duh,

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.624 align:middle line:10%
dah duh.

00:36:22.624 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Then they'll say well, look.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And basically, like
on a big video screen,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:90%
they run the movie.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And there you are taking
advantage of somebody,

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.780 align:middle line:90%
doing some other kind of thing.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they do that
enough that you get the idea.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I see my problem.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:90%
But what about this?

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And they'll show you
something about that.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.154 align:middle line:84%
So after you've
done this enough,

00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
it's not they make
you do a whole review,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:84%
they just use it
as a tool to help

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:84%
you understand what
your problems are,

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:90%
where you need growth.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Then they may suggest something
if you're at a lower level

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:90%
and send you back.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Or you may plan with them
what you want to do next.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And you may plan with them who
you want to do it with next.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And in very specific
situations that you think

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.295 align:middle line:84%
would be meaningful to you that
would really help you grow.

00:37:06.295 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Who's they?

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.580 align:middle line:84%
They are entities, just
like we are entities.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Except their focus is
in the nonphysical.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.492 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's everything
that isn't physical.

00:37:21.492 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything that isn't in
our universe is nonphysical.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the
nonphysical, which

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is all kinds of
virtual realities

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.596 align:middle line:90%
are in the nonphysical.

00:37:27.596 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just lumping
them all together.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So they are aware
in the nonphysical

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
like we're aware
in the physical.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And part of the jobs they
have, service that they have,

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is to help us make
those transitions.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They can also be
referred to as guides.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just other
entities that aren't

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.410 align:middle line:84%
physical with which
you communicate

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and who are helpful.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:84%
These guides aren't
perfect people.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
They're also
learning and growing.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.927 align:middle line:84%
The whole system is
learning and growing.

00:37:57.927 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got to think
of it as a system.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.620 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it
as a supreme being,

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that's taking what we
know here in the physical

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and just translating it there.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.648 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we're a
monkey and there we're

00:38:07.648 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:90%
a bigger super monkey.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a system of consciousness.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And like all systems, like
think of our ecosystem,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.929 align:middle line:90%
it's got its niches.

00:38:16.929 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's got different
kinds of things that are

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.490 align:middle line:90%
in it, its different spaces.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It's got self-balancing
mechanisms

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that evolve together
to all contribute

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.182 align:middle line:90%
to the success of the whole.

00:38:27.182 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way
our ecosystem works.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Everything's interconnected.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
system works, too.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.464 align:middle line:90%
It's a consciousness.

00:38:32.464 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And So all the pieces have
evolved to interact and help

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.730 align:middle line:90%
They all have niches.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:90%
This helps this level.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.397 align:middle line:90%
That level helps the next level.

00:38:41.397 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And it all works together.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a big system.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So try not to impose your
physical concepts of things

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.120 align:middle line:84%
being individual, people doing
things, it's not like that.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a consciousness system.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a big ecosystem.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.340 align:middle line:90%
There is like leadership roles.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It's benign.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not the idea of the god
sitting on his throne playing

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.505 align:middle line:90%
with his pet people.

00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to change
that and I will do this.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not that kind of a thing.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people ask me, they
say well, doesn't this being,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:84%
isn't he aware of
everything and everybody?

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And well he can be
But he's aware of you

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and I like you and I
are aware of our liver.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, are you aware
of your liver?

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Sorta.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.455 align:middle line:84%
You're not really in an active
kind of relationship to it.

00:39:39.455 --> 00:39:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You know if something major
has gone wrong with it,

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:90%
you may try to have it fixed.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:90%
You've got a big system.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And the system's self-balancing.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.930 align:middle line:84%
If something happens
to kind of unbalance it

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:84%
or a problem happens, then
attention gets drawn there.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.680 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of get fixed.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the way all
big systems work.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.287 align:middle line:90%
Corporations are big systems.

00:39:58.287 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:90%
They work like that.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:90%
The corporation hums along.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.459 align:middle line:84%
The CEO doesn't know what's
going on in the mailroom.

00:40:04.459 --> 00:40:06.750 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't really care what's
going on in the mailroom.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.104 align:middle line:84%
He knows he has a mailroom
and that mail comes in

00:40:09.104 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:90%
and the mail goes out.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's really all
he has to know about it.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not like he has
to monitor everything

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:16.920 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the mailroom.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It just goes on.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.830 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the system.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It evolves.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.474 align:middle line:84%
That mailroom may grow
bigger or shrink or whatever

00:40:23.474 --> 00:40:24.640 align:middle line:90%
by the needs of the company.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And it may evolve to meet the
needs of the company, whatever

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:84%
As the company changes,
the mailroom changes.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But taking care of the
mailroom is not what he does.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not what the CEO does.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He's got a bigger
picture than that.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't deal with that.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:90%
He can.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:84%
If that suddenly becomes
the break point and they're

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.929 align:middle line:84%
not getting their checks on
time because the mailroom is not

00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:50.970 align:middle line:84%
getting them out or getting
them in or something.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.042 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe the CEO goes
down to the mailroom

00:40:53.042 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:90%
to see what's going on.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>> As you get lower entropy,
the number of choices you have

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
you can do increases.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.736 align:middle line:84%
Again, low entropy
means a greater ability

00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to make change, a greater
ability to do work.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
definition of entropy.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So you may be working
as a guide or helping

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:54.570 align:middle line:84%
people do those transitions
and still have a body here.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:90%
You can be doing both.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Or have two bodies here.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.476 align:middle line:84%
Things get more
accessible to you,

00:42:01.476 --> 00:42:02.600 align:middle line:90%
the lower entropy you have.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:84%
If you are very beginning
in this evolution thing,

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:90%
you don't do that.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:90%
You pop in.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.950 align:middle line:90%
You pop out.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You're one place at one time,
you're not parallel processing.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
parallel processing.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can be conscious
in several reality frames

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And even your consciousness
here can be trained to do that.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is
the people here who

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:84%
are acting in those
roles as helpers.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there
are people here who

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:84%
are operational in that reality,
given the job to do that,

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:84%
because you have to understand
how the human mind works.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand there
are attachments to the reality

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and the transition problems.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.563 align:middle line:84%
If you come from another
reality system that

00:42:43.563 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any of
that, then you're

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
not going to be very
helpful to these people.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:10%
So, yes, people
who have experience

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.320 align:middle line:10%
here are much better at
helping in a transition

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.430 align:middle line:10%
at being guides.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.075 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you will get a guide
that has no experience here.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They have experience
other places.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But most of them do have
experience in virtual realities

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.277 align:middle line:84%
that are physical because
that's the best place to learn.

00:43:06.277 --> 00:43:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But, mostly, yes, they have
experience here because that

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.750 align:middle line:84%
makes them more valuable
teachers and helpers.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And often they nudge us in
ways that we need to go.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.730 align:middle line:90%
They give us little nudges.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Show us things that kind
of help open our minds.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:84%
We are in individuated
consciousness.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:10%
And part of that consciousness
is engaged in this game.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, you say, well,
how is that part of it?

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you were
playing a video game

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:middle line:10%
of a virtual reality,
part of your consciousness

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.054 align:middle line:10%
would be focused on that game.

00:43:39.054 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't
mean you couldn't

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:10%
go up and make a trip
to the refrigerator

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.023 align:middle line:10%
to get something to drink.

00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:45.422 align:middle line:10%
Part of that consciousness is
doing other things as well.

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Part of that consciousness
knows that you

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.671 align:middle line:10%
should be doing your
homework instead

00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:50.640 align:middle line:10%
of playing the video game.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:56.560 align:middle line:10%
But you multiprocess
in different levels

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.230 align:middle line:10%
as consciousness all the time.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:03.646 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is just one
level of our consciousness.

00:44:03.646 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I got the more I let
go of my resistances

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.590 align:middle line:10%
and my misconceptions, the
more I feel that I'm not alone,

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.930 align:middle line:10%
that there is always presence
with me that's helpful.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.970 align:middle line:10%
I have a grandson who, as
soon as he was able to talk,

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:11.050 align:middle line:10%
told his mother that
angels don't have bones.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Angels don't have bones.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:90%
He was very insistent about it.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Then, when he got a
little more verbal,

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
he told her that when she
was little and she was sad,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:84%
he would come and play
with her and cheer her up.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:90%
He remembered being an angel.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That's phenomenal to
me, just phenomenal.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't see them.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.930 align:middle line:90%
His brother does.

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:84%
His younger brother can
tell you, yes, there's

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.740 align:middle line:90%
an angel over there.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And he can describe it to you.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So people see things
that I don't see.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I accept it on faith.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I trust them.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.844 align:middle line:84%
I believe what they tell
me, especially children.

00:45:51.844 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And here are these
two little guys

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:90%
who can say, yes, I see it.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It's right over there.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So they're there.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Though I may not be
physically aware,

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:08.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense of comfort and
companionship that tells me

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that there is more
here than I can see.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> This is not a
graduate school.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
This is, at least, an elementary
school, if not a preschool.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.660 align:middle line:10%
This is a place where
young consciousness

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:32.930 align:middle line:10%
learns the rudimentary facts
of being, the ways to be.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a place where
all of us, advanced people.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here thinks
they're advanced.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You know that's
just the way it is.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:10%
We're all struggling in
an elementary school.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.320 align:middle line:10%
Trying to figure this out.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.975 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:55.760 align:middle line:84%
May stop coming here
because this learning

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:84%
lab is good for certain
sorts of things.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of
use it up to where

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
it's like you don't have
to go back to third grade.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, you may graduate
from this reality frame.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:90%
But there's others.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.944 align:middle line:84%
And there's other challenges,
other things to do.

00:47:12.944 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways
of giving back.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.890 align:middle line:84%
There's other
services to perform.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that's the end.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Now you go sit on your cloud.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.110 align:middle line:90%
You've earned it.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not that way.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:90%
The system itself is evolving.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Not only are you evolving, but
the whole system is evolving.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.415 align:middle line:84%
The whole consciousness
thing is not a static thing.

00:47:32.415 --> 00:47:35.035 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.035 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's expanding,
I write about this.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.190 align:middle line:90%
The universe is not stagnant.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an expanding process.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:47.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's always something
new, always something greater.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.665 align:middle line:10%
So I'm looking forward to
exploring many new realities

00:47:50.665 --> 00:47:53.600 align:middle line:10%
even beyond
form-based realities.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And I think there
is no and as such.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.440 align:middle line:10%
There is no final
destination as such.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.260 align:middle line:10%
Because I think as soul,
our whole purpose as soul

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.506 align:middle line:10%
is to expand exponentially
into infinity.

00:48:05.506 --> 00:48:06.630 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what we are.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
We're consciousness
that has no limits.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And with no limits, we can
expand in any direction,

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:84%
into any form, into
any aspect we choose.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Even when we evolve
beyond the humanoid

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the astral plane,
and we go beyond thought forms,

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and we go beyond all form-based
realities, which eventually we

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:90%
will evolve beyond.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Even then there will
be new vistas for us

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.700 align:middle line:84%
to conquer that's way beyond
our form-based realities.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It just is beyond
anything we can

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.800 align:middle line:90%
think of in our current state.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But there is an exciting,
never-ending future,

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel, or, let's just say
present available for all

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.050 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Much of our communication
is not verbal--

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.640 align:middle line:10%
like you and I are now
doing this verbally--

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:10%
but much of our communication
with other people is

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.210 align:middle line:10%
non-verbal.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:10%
And I don't mean body language.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean non-verbal in
a telepathic sense

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.380 align:middle line:10%
where we share information.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.890 align:middle line:10%
The New Age community,
it's vibes, right?

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:11.290 align:middle line:10%
You get good vibes or bad vibes.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.470 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same thing.

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:14.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just we trade.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's those vibes and that
nonphysical communication

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:84%
is why when you are very
positive, positive things begin

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.440 align:middle line:84%
to happen around you because
that's what you're tuned into,

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
focused on, that's what

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.417 align:middle line:90%
you accept in your reality.

00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:32.500 align:middle line:10%
The other stuff that
otherwise you would find that

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.690 align:middle line:10%
would be cold and prickly,
you don't relate to it.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:10%
It just passes by.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.180 align:middle line:10%
It's like an unpleasant
event that doesn't touch you

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:10%
because you no longer
interpret that as, oh, no,

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:10%
how could they do that to me?

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:10%
You've grown past that.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:50.725 align:middle line:10%
So now, it's just there.

00:49:50.725 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:10%
And oh, that's
just the way it is.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And it goes by.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.620 align:middle line:10%
And it's not prickly
or cold anymore.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.082 align:middle line:90%
So it's by changing yourself.

00:49:59.082 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly the world gets
better, not because you

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.550 align:middle line:84%
change the world but because
you're reinterpreting

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.752 align:middle line:90%
the world differently.

00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What I do impacts everything.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And it does matter
if I cut down a tree.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And it does matter
if I blow up rocks.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm having an impact.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm impacting an entire system.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Just because I can't see that
the trees have consciousness

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean that they don't.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
can't see it, I am

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more willing
to trust that everything

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is interconnected and that
what I do and what I believe,

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:84%
even what I think, has an
effect on other people.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>> People may find that as
they start to listen to that

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:10%
internal voice, that they will
start to do things that are

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.890 align:middle line:10%
more in line with their felt
sense of purpose and meaning.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And so they may change careers.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Or they may change
relationships.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:10%
Or they may move to an
environment that is more

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:05.900 align:middle line:10%
conducive for who they are.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.330 align:middle line:84%
They might start
maybe doing artwork

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that they put off
all of their lives

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.410 align:middle line:84%
or thought they
never had time for

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.580 align:middle line:84%
or start to write or to explore
something that maybe they

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.660 align:middle line:90%
had only dreamed of before.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that in a
lot of cases, people

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.960 align:middle line:84%
start to move more in
line with their dreams.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the past, they might
have felt constrained because

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of others' expectations or
societal expectations or job

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.640 align:middle line:84%
expectations, and they
could never find the courage

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to make the change that
they knew at some deep level

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:38.830 align:middle line:90%
they needed to make.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think more
often than not, people

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.600 align:middle line:84%
who do this will
start to work to bring

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.020 align:middle line:84%
those changes into
the lives and to also

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:84%
move more consciously
in the whole journey

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.508 align:middle line:90%
of self-transformation.

00:51:53.508 --> 00:51:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the soul is an
aspect of the divine, however,

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.650 align:middle line:84%
you want to hold that
concept in your mind.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's God, Allah,
Spirit the universe, greater

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever concept you hold,
I think each one of us

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:90%
is a piece of that.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And that is inherently perfect.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:84%
We spend our entire lives
learning and growing

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and finding our way
back to oneness.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the driving
force in all of us all the time.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether we know it or
not, we are seeking union

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.100 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's our soul
that is urging us back

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to be part with
the divine again.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Kindness is of the
utmost importance.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Kindness is everything.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:90%
It's what everyone really wants.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Kindness can have many faces.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.332 align:middle line:84%
But that is the most
important thing in the world.

00:53:09.332 --> 00:53:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I say this because I feel
like it is so important

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and we don't realize it.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And we always see
our limitations.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And we always see our deficits.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.771 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is we're whole.

00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You can be the individual
that had all those experiences.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.330 align:middle line:84%
You can be all those individuals
that had those experiences.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can still be
a part of the whole

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to where you have a larger
awareness over anything else.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It's true that
you do become more

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.440 align:middle line:90%
integrated with everything.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing that
now as you're growing.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have to
wait to you get enlightened.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.721 align:middle line:84%
As you grow, and get a
bigger and bigger picture,

00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:53.940 align:middle line:84%
you become more
connected to everything.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.315 align:middle line:84%
You start having a
bigger view of the world.

00:53:56.315 --> 00:53:59.635 align:middle line:90%


00:53:59.635 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I was trying to wrap
my head around this--

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:90%
how can we all be one--

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.930 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:10%
And the image that I
became comfortable with

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:12.430 align:middle line:10%
was imagining that the whole,
the universe, god, whatever you

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.930 align:middle line:10%
want to call it is the ocean.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's all there is is everything.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are all of
these waves in the ocean.

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Each one is separate,
distinct, and unique,

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.690 align:middle line:84%
but can't be separated
from the whole.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So part of my soul's journey is
coming to that understanding,

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is learning, and being
able to incorporate

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in my being more and
more the understanding

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:43.010 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not separate.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I am part of the whole.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:90%
You are part of the whole.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And that we really are one.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the more you grow up,
the more effect you can have

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and make things happen so if
you're a very grown person,

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.530 align:middle line:84%
then you can have a
very large effect.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Now that effect could be that
you do paranormal things or you

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:07.120 align:middle line:90%
heal somebody.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It could mean that
you travel around

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.457 align:middle line:84%
and interact with beings
all over the place.

00:55:10.457 --> 00:55:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Or it could mean that you're
just a darned good example.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that's around you
just feels so calm and so nice

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that wherever you go, you
have this effect, just

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.650 align:middle line:90%
by being there.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.470 align:middle line:84%
People interact with you and
they like you right away.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, they even act
better when they're around you.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.020 align:middle line:90%
They even make better choices.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.290 align:middle line:90%
You're a good example.

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:32.186 align:middle line:84%
You help them see
a better way to go.

00:55:32.186 --> 00:55:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's having
a big effect.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:44.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Generally speaking, if
you think back to the planet

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.400 align:middle line:10%
and the evolution of
life on the planet,

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.710 align:middle line:10%
it took a couple of billion
years for life to emerge from

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.800 align:middle line:10%
the primordial nothingness.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then scientists
that looked back

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:00.950 align:middle line:84%
over huge long
scales of time talk

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:06.200 align:middle line:84%
about decimal pointing things,
meaning in 10 year increments.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So it took about a
million years for life

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to emerge from unicellular
to multicellular.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it took about
half a million years

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:22.740 align:middle line:90%
to go from that to vertebrates.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Things that had skeletons.

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And then going from that to Homo
erectus, the idea of emerging

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.000 align:middle line:84%
from the seas and
back into the seas

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to some sort of something
that resembled a body,

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:42.800 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at 50,000 years.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Another decimal point
off of that 5,000 years,

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:51.540 align:middle line:84%
we think of the formations
of societies among this

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:54.170 align:middle line:84%
some of this Homo
erectus survived.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing that we might

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:59.300 align:middle line:84%
call as humanoids and the
formation of societies

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.660 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years ago.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:07.300 align:middle line:84%
500 Years ago was the
Industrial Revolution.

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.810 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago, the
Informational Revolution.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:15.150 align:middle line:84%
We're running out
of decimal points.

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:19.930 align:middle line:84%
What is human kind
evolving into?

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And we think it
is consciousness.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:24.350 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It means that mankind,
humankind, sees itself

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.470 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:35.140 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
maybe, if it's 50 years,

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and we go from
1980-2030 maybe will

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.080 align:middle line:84%
humankind perceive of
themselves as being

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.760 align:middle line:90%
different than we do now?

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Is the beginning of
this awakening something

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:56.890 align:middle line:84%
to do with this 2012
conceptual notion?

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean we can look
back in history,

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and these things, I talked
about in terms of evolution

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.100 align:middle line:84%
over billions, then millions,
then hundreds of thousands,

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and then hundreds and then
decades, they're all there.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Those are facts.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.650 align:middle line:90%
That happened.

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we stand here and
look the other direction

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:18.880 align:middle line:84%
in this thing called time that
doesn't exist, what's next?

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.030 align:middle line:84%
A philosophic question if we
can go to Rupert Sheldrake

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.300 align:middle line:90%
and formative causation.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The classic story that's
told in formative causation

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is of the hundredth
monkey that they have.

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Teaching monkeys to wash food.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they teach
their children.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they teach their
associative colonies of monkeys.

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And there is some point at
time a threshold, suddenly, all

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:54.100 align:middle line:84%
over the world, all
monkeys wash their food.

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.802 align:middle line:84%
Now if we could ask
a question, if we

00:58:55.802 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:84%
could put a microphone
under the monkey's mouth

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and say do you remember when
you didn't wash your food?

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It would be interesting
to know what

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.190 align:middle line:90%
the answer to that question is.

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:14.700 align:middle line:84%
When we evolve as human kind
to become aware of ourselves

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:19.780 align:middle line:84%
differently will we say, oh,
I remember when we were really

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.280 align:middle line:90%
stupid?

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.460 align:middle line:10%
Or will we say it's
always been this way,

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.630 align:middle line:10%
I just didn't realize it?

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.622 align:middle line:10%

a different

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.230 align:middle line:10%
And, actually, we give programs
up here, our graduate programs.

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:29.800 align:middle line:10%
And the fullness that I feel
being able to offer to people

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.280 align:middle line:10%
now-- as the director of
the Institute once again,

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.590 align:middle line:10%
and I did this many
years ago also--

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:41.620 align:middle line:10%
to offer them the possibility
of having such peak experiences

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.110 align:middle line:10%
with getting a totally
different view,

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.220 align:middle line:10%
being able to look at
their belief systems,

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.440 align:middle line:10%
being able to see a far broader
way of being than they ever

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.670 align:middle line:10%
thought possible, seeing more of
themselves than they ever knew

01:01:54.670 --> 01:02:00.910 align:middle line:10%
existed, getting beyond
limiting beliefs.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
By doing that, you also
get beyond a lot of fear.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, in doing, so
your life is enriched.

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use it
very pragmatically.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not all about being
at one with the universe.

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But how about using
that for better problem

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
solving and decision making
and connecting with each other

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.886 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the beauty
in another person.

01:02:26.886 --> 01:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
See, this is how I feel that
by learning all this stuff

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
or talking about how do
we evolve, well, just pay

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.760 align:middle line:90%
attention.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.035 align:middle line:10%
It's like that Bhagavan
Das, "Be here now."

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:39.835 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

01:02:39.835 --> 01:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%


01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a tremendous
amount of changes in my life

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.420 align:middle line:90%
since 2008.

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
For the last five years, I've
been doing my six day workshop

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
at the Monroe Institute
called OB OBE Intensive, which

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.990 align:middle line:90%
has been just a joy to do.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.230 align:middle line:10%
It's just a great experience.

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:04.670 align:middle line:10%
And in 2011, I
had the experience

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:07.370 align:middle line:10%
of having throat
cancer, which was

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:10.590 align:middle line:10%
a life changer in many ways.

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a very quick event that
occurred, actually, while I

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:19.760 align:middle line:90%
was doing one of my workshops.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I had a large
lump appear in my throat,

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.930 align:middle line:90%
in my neck.

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't till
after the workshop

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I got the diagnosis that I had
stage 4 cancer of the lymph

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.950 align:middle line:90%
nodes and tonsils.

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
After dealing with it
and successfully battling

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the cancer, and
being healed from it,

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.650 align:middle line:84%
it set my course a
little bit differently.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I became much
more interested

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
in the whole concept, the
process of death and dying,

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.660 align:middle line:90%
and the afterlife.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote my latest book.

01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
"Adventures In the Afterlife"
is a result of my personal trial

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%
that I endured with cancer.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was totally interested
in out-of-body experiences.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually for 20 years,
that was my total focus.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And my writing focus was
on out-of-body experiences.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But after having
this close experience

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
with my own mortality,
it got me extremely

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
interested in what
exactly happens

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
at the process of death.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%
How do we handle it?

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.770 align:middle line:90%
How do we prepare for it?

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a
large part of my focus

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:32.315 align:middle line:90%
for the last three years.

01:04:32.315 --> 01:04:35.570 align:middle line:90%


01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot not only during
my bout with stage 4 cancer,

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
but in the process of healing.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a
different perception

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of the entire
process of evolution.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It made me more
aware that I have

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to be more focused on my
state of consciousness

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and less focused
on my surroundings.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
That it's my state
of consciousness

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.330 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm here to work on.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've all incarnated
is to learn from experiences.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
from personal challenges

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and we create our
own challenges.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And we, through trial and
error, we slowly grow.

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But once you recognize that, it
really wakens you to the fact

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that I am orchestrating
this process.

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I even orchestrated the cancer.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe I did
create everything.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:35.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a challenge.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It was an opportunity,
though, also.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time, I
wasn't looking at that.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But now in retrospect,
I can view it

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and know that it was
an opportunity for me

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to completely readdress,
to reappraise everything

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
in my life, to take a
hard look at my own state

01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
my own priorities,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and to really begin
to focus on my ability

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to make it an enlightened
transition, Doing

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:11.060 align:middle line:84%
what many people would
say to be a better person.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But it goes beyond the
being a better person.

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It's to be more aware of
your totality of yourself,

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
so that you can focus on
what is truly important which

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is our spiritual consciousness
and trying to remove our fears,

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
remove the limits we've
created for ourselves,

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and really accelerate
our own personal growth.

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:37.795 align:middle line:84%
And it really brings it to
the forefront in your life.

01:06:37.795 --> 01:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%


01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, one of the issues that
became really important to me

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.960 align:middle line:10%
was that I noticed that it
seemed like no matter what

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.950 align:middle line:10%
organization I was a part of,
there was always this point

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:57.180 align:middle line:10%
where ego would start
to get involved.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.400 align:middle line:10%
And before long, people
would have these turf wars.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And they were great people.

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.120 align:middle line:10%
And they were doing
marvelous work.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And the organizations
were great.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.860 align:middle line:10%
But this dynamic
kept creeping up

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.950 align:middle line:10%
over and over and over again.

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that I was
immune from that either.

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I was a part of
that dynamic, too.

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I had my ways
that I thought were right.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what would
happen is after a while,

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
people would forget the mission.

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would start
getting absorbed

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:30.200 align:middle line:90%
in these personal dynamics.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, I was walking on
the beach one day puzzling

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
over this question of why it
is that we as human beings

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
are so prone to this
divisive infighting.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And why it is that
people forget the mission

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.870 align:middle line:90%
in the process of that.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of just tossed that
question out to the universe.

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't expecting
any kind of an answer.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, these
words came back to me.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it simply said
go to your heart.

01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's pretty generic.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.490 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But I have known in the past
that when that kind of thing

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
happens, I should probably
pay attention to it.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So that night, I came home.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
bed in the evening,

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I simply focused
on the area where

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.899 align:middle line:84%
my heart is, not the heart
itself is, as a pump,

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.374 align:middle line:84%
but more of the
energy center there.

01:08:24.374 --> 01:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And there were
several things that

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:28.399 align:middle line:84%
began to happen right
away that I noticed.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:34.040 align:middle line:84%
One was that my mind
became very still, which

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.279 align:middle line:84%
was a big thing for me
because normally my mind is

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.229 align:middle line:84%
going 100 miles an hour and
thinking all kinds of things.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:43.069 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I can't even get
to sleep because of it.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I began to
focus on that area,

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.939 align:middle line:90%
that stillness happened.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well
that's interesting.

01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was noticed that
my body got very relaxed,

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
which I was familiar
with with my work

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160 align:middle line:90%
at the Munroe Institute.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.090 align:middle line:90%
I knew how to do that.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But this seemed
to even deepen it.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.399 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
thing that I noticed

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
was that my dream
life really began

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.850 align:middle line:90%
to emerge very powerfully.

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So much so that I began
to write down my dreams.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And began to discover
something that I thought

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.910 align:middle line:90%
was really important.

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:22.069 align:middle line:84%
As my dream life began to merge
with my waking life in ways

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
that I hadn't noticed before.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very
profound thing for me.

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And it set me on a course
that, really, is still

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.279 align:middle line:90%
a part of my work today.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:36.850 align:middle line:10%
This question of how
do we move beyond

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:41.859 align:middle line:10%
this egocentric perspective
of the world in such a way

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:45.160 align:middle line:10%
that we can remember that we're
here for a larger mission.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.293 align:middle line:84%
And what does the heart
have to do with that?

01:09:47.293 --> 01:09:51.410 align:middle line:90%


01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It's been enough time
and enough things

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
have happened that it's even
a little difficult for me

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.890 align:middle line:90%
to know where I was in 2008.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have gone from
thinking virtual reality was

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.766 align:middle line:84%
a wild, crazy idea out
on the fringe to being

01:10:08.766 --> 01:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
pretty much in agreement
that that's the way it is.

01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the
experiments that have

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
been done in the
last decade have all

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
been pointing to
that as a result.

01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't really explain
them other than saying this

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.530 align:middle line:90%
is a virtual reality.

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's reality based
on information,

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:24.480 align:middle line:90%
an information-based reality.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.940 align:middle line:10%
So my model takes
that a step further

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.910 align:middle line:10%
and says consciousness
is the computer.

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard
me say in videos

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that the scientists,
now, are the high priests

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.140 align:middle line:90%
of Western culture.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.100 align:middle line:10%
The high priests
are the people that

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:43.220 align:middle line:10%
tell everybody else what's
true, what to believe.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.010 align:middle line:10%
So, now, if the scientists
say this is what we found,

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.890 align:middle line:10%
everybody nods and says
that's the way it is.

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:54.210 align:middle line:10%
So they form that role,
where 500 or 600 years ago it

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:56.670 align:middle line:10%
was the high priests
of religion that

01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:00.470 align:middle line:10%
told everybody what was truth.

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So scientists are
our new high priests.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And if the scientists
come on board

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and understand the
larger reality,

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:09.870 align:middle line:90%
then everybody else will follow.

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But you see the progress
gets faster and faster.

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Only 300 years ago, this
was a very rough place

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:19.130 align:middle line:90%
to live on this planet.

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty violent and
pretty tough and pretty uncaring

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:26.090 align:middle line:90%
and a pretty hard existence.

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
In the last 300
years, we've probably

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
grown more toward
kinder and gentler

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
than in the two million
years before that.

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's a lot of progress.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's been made in a
surprisingly short amount

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
of time.

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:44.390 align:middle line:90%


01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The history of human race the
history of wars and challenge

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.910 align:middle line:90%
of conflict, of crisis.

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean is it not
when you look at it.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Look at our last century--

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
World War I, World War
II, series of wars.

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that
maybe, just maybe,

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.110 align:middle line:90%
that's where the lessons are.

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
50 million people or
more died in World War II

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:09.270 align:middle line:90%
according to the history books.

01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%
But no one really died.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
They shifted their consciousness
to another energy body.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has continued.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
No one in the history of
this planet has ever died.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:25.020 align:middle line:90%
They've continued on and on.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Each time they re-experience
the earth, they've learned more.

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
They've grown more.

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
immortal, it doesn't

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.630 align:middle line:90%
matter how long it takes.

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it takes
a million years to evolve.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
evolution of consciousness.

01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have a chance, now,
with the internet who can net

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
all of these little bubbles
of enlightenment you might say

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that have perked up through
our culture and other cultures.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a little
more force now.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:04.886 align:middle line:90%
We have a better understanding.

01:13:04.886 --> 01:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of
consciousness is

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
toward lower entropy which leads
you to where we're all going.

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And this evolution
is toward love,

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
toward cooperation,
compassion, caring.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the future.

01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:21.345 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
evolving toward.

01:13:21.345 --> 01:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, you read the
papers and it doesn't

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
look like we've gotten
too close to that.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We're a bit far from that.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
If we can gather enough
force, enough people, that

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
understand the
nature of reality,

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that will change pretty quickly.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Bob Monroe, the founder
of this organization,

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
always thought that things
like the internet were

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the materialistic reflection of
the interconnection of people.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And today we live
in a world where

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you can pick up your
portable mobile phone

01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and talk to anybody in the
world, any place on the planet,

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.540 align:middle line:90%
whenever you want to.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm old enough to know
stories about when

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
the telephone was invented.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And people would say why
do I need a telephone?

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, because you can pick up
and call your farmer friends

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.660 align:middle line:90%
down the way.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.076 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I want
to talk to them, I

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
don't even like them
very much, why would I

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:20.922 align:middle line:90%
want to call them on the phone?

01:14:20.922 --> 01:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll just hop on the
horse and ride over there.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Why would I need a telephone?

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
There is an understanding
in today's culture

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
growing up that
interconnectedness of humanity

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.400 align:middle line:90%
is how it is.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Hasn't it always been that way?

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So when we make that
flip to this thing we're

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:43.039 align:middle line:84%
calling the evolved
consciousness,

01:14:43.039 --> 01:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
will we say, oh, well,
it's always been this way.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I've always understood
the world this way

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of humankind

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and hasn't everybody
always known this?

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We are evolving vastly from
an informational standpoint.

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think we've
got a long way to go

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.580 align:middle line:90%
from a relational standpoint.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
People are so fascinated
with electronics.

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's this idea
that somehow we're

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in constant relationship with
people through our electronics.

01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there's a
big difference between sitting

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
with somebody and
talking face-to-face

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and heart to heart with them
as opposed to texting or email.

01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't even begin to
create the same space

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.170 align:middle line:90%
or the same nuance.

01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Body language is completely
stripped out of the equation.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And people think that
is real relationship.

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is people think,

01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm in a relationship.

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel so lonely?

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel so isolated?

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.655 align:middle line:90%
I've got all this texting.

01:15:46.655 --> 01:15:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got a Snapchat.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got selfies and everything.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's a deep
part of us that

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:55.940 align:middle line:84%
knows that something is
atrophying in that process.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
For me, there is nothing like
being able to sit down and have

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.010 align:middle line:90%
a chat with somebody.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's the stuff of life.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That's where things
really happen.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
through electronics

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
is we have these
truncated conversations.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it gets stripped down to
its barest informational aspect.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think that there's
any substitute for human

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.730 align:middle line:90%
to human contact.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It often comes up to say that
this interconnectedness that I

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
talk about with technology can
be looked at through one lens

01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and say ah, but it's actually
separating people from one

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.380 align:middle line:90%
another.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
What about that personal bonding
and the personal experiences

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and dinner with the family?

01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Where now they're all sitting
around texting each other.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a disconnect?

01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think the key word
is the technology is a step.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It is part of this evolution,
an awakening of a notion.

01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll move past this to
where it isn't so dependent.

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a very interesting
movement past this

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
because there will be
times when people will

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:14.120 align:middle line:90%
understand they're connected.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.330 align:middle line:10%
Just because it's
different than what

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:20.000 align:middle line:10%
we think of usually as
personal connectedness

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.500 align:middle line:10%
and having one-on-one or
a group of friends that

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.670 align:middle line:10%
are best buddies forever,
just because it's different

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:34.580 align:middle line:10%
than that doesn't mean
there isn't a connection

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:38.030 align:middle line:10%
in a different way, in a way
that we've never had before,

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:42.050 align:middle line:10%
in a way to know that that
person is always there for me

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.330 align:middle line:10%
whether or not I've seen
them in a year or two.

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean just in our
recent history,

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
when people would travel to
other parts of the world,

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in some
sort of conflict situation

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
or on vacation, it
would be weeks and weeks

01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and weeks or months when
you were out of connection

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
with them.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean just traveling by
wagon around the United States

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.150 align:middle line:90%
was a problem.

01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You might be gone
for a year or two.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.569 align:middle line:84%
If you sailed a ship
across the seas.

01:18:10.569 --> 01:18:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened to so and so?

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know it was 10 years
ago when they sailed off.

01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a different
form of connectivity now.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When you think of the
heart, when we in our normal

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.770 align:middle line:84%
conversation, when we talk
about things that are really

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
important, inevitably,
unconsciously,

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:31.910 align:middle line:90%
we bring in the heart.

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
we're going to have

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
a really great conversation,
a deep conversation,

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:38.632 align:middle line:84%
with somebody, we
don't say that we're

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
going to have a brain
to brain with them.

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.673 align:middle line:84%
We say we're going to have a
heart to heart conversation

01:18:42.673 --> 01:18:43.820 align:middle line:90%
with them.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you're going
to talk in a way

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
communicate with an audience,

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:51.050 align:middle line:84%
we tell somebody to
speak from the heart.

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We even connect
the issues of soul

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to it, because we talk
about heart and soul

01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:58.970 align:middle line:90%
as being sort of a union there.

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, we have overlooked
this relational specialty

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, because
unlike the brain that

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
likes to slice and dice
and categorize everything

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:13.580 align:middle line:84%
into these very
strict categories that

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.180 align:middle line:84%
are based on nouns, it's
the heart that seems

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to know about relationships.

01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the heart that
starts to develop whenever

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.275 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about things that
are really important to us.

01:19:26.275 --> 01:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%


01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:33.999 align:middle line:84%
The mind itself cannot
take you beyond the mind.

01:19:33.999 --> 01:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But we have to get
to the point where

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.930 align:middle line:84%
we make that grand
evolutionary leap, where

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the mind and
really be our true self

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
existing in that ethereal,
magnificent state

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
of pure light, pure
love, pure beingness.

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> As Gandhi said, be the change
you want to see in the world.

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not a matter of thinking.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I think we are on a trajectory
to grow up as a species,

01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
evolve the quality
of our consciousness,

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and that when we do
that, we will live in

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
a much nicer, kinder,
gentler place.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.930 align:middle line:90%
We will learn to cooperate.

01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:21.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Where would you
put developing souls

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:28.640 align:middle line:10%
or consciousness that needs to
develop the skills of a truly

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:36.500 align:middle line:10%
mature, evolved, spiritually
evolved, highly evolved soul?

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.930 align:middle line:90%
One that would do no harm.

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
One that would
project only goodness.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
One that would project
only positives or at least

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
neutrals into everyone
in your environment.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Where would you put
these developing souls

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness while they're
in their developmental stage?

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Would you not place them
into a nice dense environment

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%
where they can do no harm?

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Would you not place them
in a kindergarten of matter

01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that is so dense,
so incredibly dense,

01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts don't
manifest instantly?

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect though.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a slowed down environment
where you put the developing

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
souls that are learning the
skills of an evolved soul,

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
an evolved state of
consciousness that

01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
must take 100% responsibility
for every thought,

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.220 align:middle line:90%
word, and deed.

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:46.760 align:middle line:90%


01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We're kind of been isolated
on this planet to limit

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the damage that we can do I
can't help but think that when

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
we move through this stage--
and I do think it's a stage.

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a very
important stage.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And so even though I've
talked about moving beyond it,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
give the impression

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that what has happened has
not been necessary, because it

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.090 align:middle line:90%
has been absolutely necessary.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
This development of the
individualized sense of self

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
is important, because it
gives us a unique perspective

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.610 align:middle line:90%
on the universe.

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
As we learn to
moderate that, I think

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
we will become less dangerous
to ourselves and to the planet

01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and to other people.

01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
there's a part of me

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that suspects maybe
we'll be asked

01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of a much larger
sense of being that may

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:32.290 align:middle line:90%
be beyond this planet alone.

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're not
ready for that yet.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Far back as I remember,
like two or three years old up

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
to the present time, it's been
a continual growth of lowering

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
entropy, of learning,
figuring things out.

01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And no doubt sometimes I
gain some entropy, too,

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.730 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's generally been a
lowering of entropy, a bigger

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.430 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are devolving
because we get so wrapped up

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:02.590 align:middle line:84%
in our preoccupation with
how can we use people and use

01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:04.780 align:middle line:90%
things rather than what we give?

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But, mostly, that's why
the whole thing evolves

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is because the average
level of entropy

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:12.710 align:middle line:90%
goes down as time goes on.

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
See love is about
other, not about self.

01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
The opposite of love is fear.

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's all about self.

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
What about me?

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And love is what about you?

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:25.250 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So a cooperative environment,
rather than a grabby one

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:31.240 align:middle line:90%
or a self-centered one.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Christ said love one another.

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:34.542 align:middle line:84%
Bob Monroe said the
only way to know

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is to find out for
yourself or have fun.

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:38.680 align:middle line:90%
The Buddha by certain wisdoms.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know have anything
spectacular to say

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
that haven't been given by
similar people of thinking.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I would rather be remembered
for how I treated other people

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:53.170 align:middle line:90%
rather than what I say.

01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%
That seems to count.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:24:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You hear people sometimes
claim that they are enlightened

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
their last time here.

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of this cycle
of reincarnation.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I am an enlightened person
and I'm going on other things.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.700 align:middle line:84%
When you hear someone declare
that they're enlightened,

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
it's almost a certain
sign that they are not.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound to me
like that's about other,

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.840 align:middle line:90%
that that's about caring.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It sounds to me like
that's about them.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
You can always find
something to do here.

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:29.244 align:middle line:84%
You can always find
something to give.

01:24:29.244 --> 01:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There's always
somebody that needs

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.660 align:middle line:90%
help, that needs encouragement.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
There's always new
consciousness coming

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:40.230 align:middle line:84%
in at the bottom of this
system that needs to evolve.

01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:41.670 align:middle line:90%
So there is no end.

01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The system itself
is still evolving.

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.054 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fixed system.

01:24:45.054 --> 01:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you get to
the top and the bell rings,

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and you know you're done.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.650 align:middle line:90%
The top's changing continually.

01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
some way to give back.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:58.770 align:middle line:90%


01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I do think that it is this
process of discovering how we

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
begin to not be so limited by
the individual sense of self,

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
that we learn to open the
heart, and that we learn to move

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that we are
in concert with the world,

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
in concert with other people,
in concert with the evolution

01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and in concert with
the evolution of the planet,

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.130 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether or not you understand
anything about the nature

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.510 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness or the way
reality works is not really

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:34.740 align:middle line:10%
important.

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether you ever do anything
paranormal, not important.

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
What's important is
that you change yourself

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to lower your entropy,
move toward being caring,

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
make it about other, increase
your capacity to love.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.830 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And why is that
important to you?

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that will
change your whole life.

01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%
That will change your world.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of us struggle
throughout our lives.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.850 align:middle line:90%
We struggle with everybody.

01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We try real hard
to make everything

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.640 align:middle line:90%
be the way we want it to be.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.422 align:middle line:84%
We struggle with
our relationships.

01:26:10.422 --> 01:26:11.630 align:middle line:90%
We struggle with our spouses.

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:13.050 align:middle line:90%
We struggle with our children.

01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:14.190 align:middle line:90%
We struggle with the boss.

01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:16.080 align:middle line:90%
We struggle with the coworkers.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything we'd like to
rearrange it or make it such

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.780 align:middle line:90%
that it suits us better.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.000 align:middle line:84%
What that does is
makes us miserable.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It frustrates us.

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It gets us upset, because you
can't rearrange everything

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to be the way you want it.

01:26:31.230 --> 01:26:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And we want more and more
stuff because we think

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.715 align:middle line:90%
the stuff will make us happy.

01:26:35.715 --> 01:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
We think the stuff is going
to give us a better life.

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:40.915 align:middle line:84%
And you find out that
this stuff is irrelevant.

01:26:40.915 --> 01:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
much stuff you have,

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that the real value in this
life is the relationships.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It's people you know.

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
It's really what you can
give not what you can take.

01:26:52.878 --> 01:26:56.660 align:middle line:90%

>> Basically, just stopping
to be aware, to be present.

Don't get into the Wicked
Witch of the West territory,

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:08.600 align:middle line:84%
then to help other people do
that to realize who they are.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Ah, that's exciting to me.

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.580 align:middle line:90%
So have I evolved?

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to think I'm
using the tools better,

01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:20.630 align:middle line:90%
more consciously.

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
thing my mom used to say.

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The older I get, the more
like myself I become.

01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as evolution goes, we
are evolving with no endpoint.

01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We are on this amazing,
exciting journey

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
continues to infinity,

01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:43.850 align:middle line:90%
as far as I could imagine.

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Skip Atwater has
this wonderful saying.

01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
He says you can't not
be on the right path.

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's really true.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.780 align:middle line:10%
We each have come
into this world

01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:00.012 align:middle line:10%
because we come from a
different consciousness.

01:28:00.012 --> 01:28:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
that we are learning here

01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:05.630 align:middle line:84%
in this direct
experience, in this

01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:07.426 align:middle line:84%
what we call waking
consciousness,

01:28:07.426 --> 01:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
but what a lot of
people would actually

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:10.591 align:middle line:84%
would call it sleeping
consciousness,

01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:12.560 align:middle line:84%
because we're not really
aware in this world.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
No matter what happens,
we are learning something.

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're being changed
in really dramatic ways

01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
that I think then we take
back to the existence we had

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.601 align:middle line:90%
before we came into this world.

01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:26.340 align:middle line:90%


01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And there you have it.

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And I do hope you enjoyed it.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, these take
listening more than once

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:33.820 align:middle line:90%
to fully understand it.

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
