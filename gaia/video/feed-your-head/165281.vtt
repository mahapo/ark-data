His parents were Austrians

Abram came along,

before its cause was discovered.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It was caused by a deficiency
of niacin, also known

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:90%
as vitamin B3.

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the main problems
in mental hospital

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%

There was really bedlam there.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
they do at this point.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It used to be-- when I
went through residency,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
emphasis on psychotherapy

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and trying to help people
psychoanalytically,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
or in psychotherapy.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
psychiatrists really just

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
don't even do that anymore.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
They basically are just
basically pill pushers

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:90%
for the pharmaceutical industry.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, it's
almost like a brainwashing

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
of the medical profession
that this is the only way

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:90%
to do things.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical companies
support the medical schools

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:90%
to a great extent.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:90%
They support the journals.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The first 50 pages of any
important medical journal

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is taken up by advertisements
for various medications,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:90%
various drugs.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The large mental hospital at
Weyburn was one of the two main

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:10%
mental hospitals
in the province,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:10%
and one of Hoffer's
chief responsibilities.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
When it was built in 1920,
it was the largest building

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
in the commonwealth.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Over half the patients at
Weyburn were schizophrenic.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. [INAUDIBLE],, who was
in charge of the whole unit,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:10%
he was in charge of
psychiatric services branch.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:10%
He was a very kind man.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
He also had the idea that
the Quakers had in 1850.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was that, first of
all, you had to provide shelter.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Second, you have to
provide good food.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Third, you had to be
kind and sympathetic.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
The Quakers in 1850 didn't
believe in doctors or nurses.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They would take insane
people, up to 12,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
move them into a house
without nurses or doctors.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.489 align:middle line:90%
Their own people would run them.

00:10:43.489 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And they would hold them there.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:90%
They'd be gentle to them, kind.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:90%
They'd work with them.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Every Saturday night, they'd
have a party and a dance.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And the staff would
dance with the patients.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It was really a very
humane situation.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:10%
>> We had 2,000
seriously ill people,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:10%
who obviously were in need
of anything we could do.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Humphry Osmond was
born in England in 1917.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Osmond studied psychiatry
while acting as an army surgeon

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Later, with John
Smythies, he had

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
done some of the earliest
scientific research

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:90%
with mescaline.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:10%
They noted that its
chemical compound was

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:10%
similar to adrenaline, and
that mescaline's effects

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.145 align:middle line:10%
on perception were similar
to schizophrenic symptoms.

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Osmond came to work
at the Weyburn Mental

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Hospital in 1952.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
He introduced Aldous
Huxley to mescaline,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
participated in a native
Canadian peyote ceremony,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and coined the
term "psychedelic"

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:90%
while living in Weyburn.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't feel we wanted to
make a great deal of money out

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We simply wanted to find things
that would help people not

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
get ill, which I, being rather
out of date and old-fashioned,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I felt was a good thing to do.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We are able to hold
our world constant.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
For the schizophrenic
person, this constancy

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
breaks down, or
begins to break down,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
which is worse because
of the uncertainty.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Schizophrenia is
characterized by abnormalities

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.955 align:middle line:90%
in the perception of reality.

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Distortions in perception
may affect all the senses--

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
sight, hearing, taste,
smell, and touch.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But it most commonly manifests
as hallucinations and delusions

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
or disorganized
speech and thinking.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a constant
noise, not always voices,

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
at least for me.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It was just noise.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It was just like every
noise is amplified.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And so you just want quiet.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:90%
You just want peace.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
You just want to make it stop.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
of making it stop.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
You have voices telling you,
you know, you're just so stupid.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And you're just lousy.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And you don't deserve to live.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And you should just go
jump off that bridge.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Or why don't you
slit your wrists?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Or why don't you--

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're
such a bad person.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Just this all negative,
negative, negative constantly

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And Dr. Hoffer and Osmond
originally hypothesized that

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
there was a substance
that was capable--

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that was found in
schizophrenics that

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
could distort reality
and affect their brain.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And they then isolated
something called adrenochrome.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
They found that the
adrenochrome could actually

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
produce schizophrenic
symptoms, could cause

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
hallucinations,
delusions, and so on.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And adrenochrome is an
oxidized product of adrenaline.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And adrenaline often occurs
when you're under stress.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
the genetics for it

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
can then develop
these oxidized stress

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
hormones that are then capable
of actually poisoning a person.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If you had the right genes,
if you had the right genetic

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
structure-- now there's
evidence for that--

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
which would allow the
conversion of too much

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline to
adrenochrome, which

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
was a hallucinogen in the
brain, that if this happened,

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
that this would act on the
brain as if they had taken LSD.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And they would then
become psychotic.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> With adrenochrome, your
legs seem a very long way down.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Your clothes may
become uncomfortable.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
if you are convinced

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that something is wrong,
almost intolerable.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Small distortions can
be even more frightening

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
than large ones because
you can't be sure

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:90%
that they are distortions.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.257 align:middle line:84%
And as tension mounts, so
does one's uncertainty.

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Ours is a simple,
comprehensive hypothesis that

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:90%
wasn't based upon chance.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We actually derived
our hypothesis

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
from very careful
observation that

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
would be made by Humphry Osmond
and John Smythies and myself.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That was our hypothesis.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.829 align:middle line:84%
Ours is the only rational
hypothesis there is.

00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The average psychiatrist will
not answer your question.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.536 align:middle line:84%
Ask him what causes
schizophrenia,

00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:48.804 align:middle line:90%
he says, I don't know.

00:15:48.804 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
They think it's biochemical.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:90%
They use the word biochemical.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.395 align:middle line:84%
But they don't understand
what that means.

00:15:53.395 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Because when you load
someone up with a toxic drug,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.436 align:middle line:84%
you're not giving him a
biochemical treatment.

00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:90%
You are merely poisoning him.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy enough
to poison people.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.176 align:middle line:90%
That's no problem.

00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So there are no theories that
are acceptable except ours.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> To offset the
effects of adrenochrome,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
we turn to the cheapest, safest,
and most easily available

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:90%
substance--

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.360 align:middle line:90%
niacin, vitamin B.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We by that time knew that
niacin might protect the cell

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
against the effect
of adrenochrome.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that
we would try niacin.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's 37 years
since I was ill.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I have recovered completely.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I always think of my
recovery as taking place

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
in about three weeks,
or 19 days to be exact.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The theory that Dr. Hoffer
has that the adrenals produce

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
this toxic
adrenalutin and that's

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
like LSD in the body,
that fits my story.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think my own part in
it was overdosing on sugar.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:10%
I love my sweets.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't aware.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.986 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know that
sugar can affect my mind.

00:17:15.986 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'll put you
on the niacin and watch

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:90%
what happens.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
any expectations.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:90%
But something happened.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I make recommendations for
vitamins or supplements

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:84%
always in terms of
cleansing and building.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I make
recommendations for diet.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.927 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It became mandatory for all
my patients that they would all

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:90%
go onto niacin.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I used drugs too.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The vitamin didn't work fast
enough, and the drugs did.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So, the best solution
was to combine them.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'd start my patients
on the drugs, which

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
would help settle it
down very quickly,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
help take away their
anxiety, their hostility,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.762 align:middle line:90%
their depression.

00:18:01.762 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Start them on vitamins.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And we used the drugs as
you would use a crutch

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.327 align:middle line:90%
for a person with a broken leg.

00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the leg is mended,
you throw away the crutch.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
As soon as our
patients are mended,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
we throw away the drugs.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.027 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how
they ought to be used.

00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So, that's where we
get the recoveries

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:90%
that we see by the combination.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what's called
orthomolecular.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
chemist Linus Pauling also

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:84%
championed the use of
vitamins as treatment.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Pauling coined the term
"orthomolecular medicine"

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
in 1968.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
The Greek "ortho" means correct.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.496 align:middle line:84%
So orthomolecular means
the right molecules

00:18:44.496 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:90%
in the right amounts.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The medical profession
has been very hostile toward

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
orthomolecular medicine,
especially the psychiatric

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't even aware
of it, of course,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:10%
until 1968 when Linus Pauling
published his very famous paper

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.165 align:middle line:10%
in "Science" called
"Orthomolecular Psychiatry."

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Pauling never accepted anyone's
word; he did his own thinking.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, Pauling was the
world's most famous scientist.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
He had a double Nobel Prize,
one for his work with chemistry.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, his work in chemistry
is the absolute basis

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:90%
of all modern medicine.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:84%
He showed how molecules
react with each other.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> They started using nutrients
to help people's heads,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.502 align:middle line:90%
feed your heads.

00:19:32.502 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
their whole body

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
got better because nutrients
don't just feed the head.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Nutrients feed the whole body.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you feed the body,
and the body gets healthier,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:90%
that feeds relationships.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you feed relationships,
then societies and cultures

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:90%
improve.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And when they improve,
nations stop warring.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And when nations stop
warring, then you

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
can start taking care
of the planet again.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this
begins with nutrition.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It was literally only 200
generations ago we were all

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
hunters and gatherers.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We had no choice but to
eat everything organic.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything was whole.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And we would eat seeds
and fruits and vegetables.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
All the animals we
ate were wild animals.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Wild animal has maybe 5%
of its body weight is fat.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the animals we eat
today, even organic animals,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at 20%.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.475 align:middle line:84%
So, food has
phenomenally changed.

00:20:27.475 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know how our
biology works in relation

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to food, it would be surprising
if we hadn't changed how

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
we think, how we
feel, and our pattern

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
of diseases, which clearly
are escalating out of control.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The brain is very
particularly dependent

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
on nutrition because this
organ is two pounds in weight.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet it consumes 20% of
circulating oxygen, glucose,

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and other nutrients.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if you like, I describe
the brain as a nutrient hog.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It's using up 10 times more.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 times more
metabolically active.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So where there's a
shortfall in diet,

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and where that plate
contains stripped down,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
ersatz food, then
of course, the brain

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is going to be one of the
first places that's affected.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And now we can see from studies
those particularly depriving

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the developing brain
in utero of nutrients

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is leading to lifelong
health problems--

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:84%
mental health and
physical health.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the problems is
the scale of food processing.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And many people think in
terms of grains and sugars

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:10%
and how they have
been processed.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting
historical element here

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
in that the ancient Romans knew
more about grain processing

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
than people did up until the
early part of the 20th century.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
That knowledge had been lost
for almost two millennia.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
We've caught up,
and we've probably

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
superseded what
the Romans had done

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of not just
refining grains, refining

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
sugars, refining and creating
all sorts of artificial fats.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And most people, unless they
are very mindful of what

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
they are eating,
are basically eating

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:90%
in this sea of junk food.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The solution is
really very simple.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I can't claim
credit for the idea.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically going
back to fresh foods,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
avoiding almost
anything that comes

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.165 align:middle line:90%
in a bottle, jar, can, or box.

00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> These processed foods bring
about inflammatory conditions.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And these inflammatory
conditions

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
all of the problems

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have today, including
psychiatric conditions,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:84%
neurological conditions,
cancer, diabetes,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.345 align:middle line:90%
heart disease, and so on.

00:23:29.345 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe that the
pharmaceutical companies do see

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
nutrient therapy and the use
of supplements and the whole

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
orthomolecular approach as
being a bit of a competitor.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And so that's part of it.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:84%
There's also a kind of
orthodoxy or a belief

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
in the medical school
training that anything

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
nutrition is always

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:90%
going to border on quackery.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I was
told in medical school

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
any doctor that prescribes
a vitamin by definition

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:90%
is a quack.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One other thing I'd like to
underline is that when we go

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
through medical school,
the first two years,

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:84%
or the first year, we
learn a lot about anatomy

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and physiology and biochemistry.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then starting in the second
year, we get to pharmacology.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that the
attitude in medical school

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the physiology
and biochemistry,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:90%
well, that's kind of--

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
we have to know that.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But the real medicine
is pharmacology.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
orientation of physicians.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we are doing
in orthomolecular

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry and orthomolecular
medicine is we're

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
going back to physiology
and biochemistry rather than

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:90%
pharmacology.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
We assume that the body has
the ability to heal itself

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:90%
if given half a chance.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And the way that happens
is by supplying the body

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
with what it needs
and trying to remove

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:90%
things that are toxic to it.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.162 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:38.162 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people don't
understand schizophrenia.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
If a patient tells
the psychiatrist

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that he or she is hearing
voices, what does that mean?

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Unless the doctor has
heard voices himself,

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:90%
it has no meaning.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.279 align:middle line:84%
He can't visualize
this happening.

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, first
of all, if we're

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.195 align:middle line:84%
going to deal with
schizophrenia,

00:26:21.195 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
it's psychology.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And we also said, we will take
hallucinogenic drugs like LSD

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and mescaline--

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and later on, adrenochrome
and adrenalutin.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.745 align:middle line:84%
We will take these drugs
and see what it does to us.

00:26:35.745 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll have a much
better comprehension of what

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
is happening to our patients.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We had to take this stuff
ourselves to test its effect.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:84%
We found that when it
goes into the brain,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
it makes the brain less
able to use its energy.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
After inhaling
adrenalutin, Dr. Hoffer

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
became suspicious of
everyone, took half an hour

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to choose between tea or
coffee, tore my robes,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE] give up his job.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:12.986 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:10%


00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>> This is so
wonderful to see this--

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:10%
this long overdue
Lifetime Achievement

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:10%
Award to my great lifetime hero.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
are, Dr. Hoffer.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I'm going to talk
on behalf of all of us patients.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:10%
And I have to try not to cry.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Because see, I'm
already starting.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Because not only have
you given us our lives,

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
you were the voice
all these years

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:90%
who said you can get better.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:90%
You will get better.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Take these simple steps.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You won't be crippled
by drug side effects.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
You've given us a quality
of life that so many of us

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:84%
were told by the conventional
psychiatric establishment was

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:90%
not possible for us.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
From the bottom of
my heart, Dr. Hoffer,

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I send you love
and gratitude and--

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and these tears.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.798 align:middle line:90%
I love you very much.

00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:21.666 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1957, we first
reported our findings.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:90%
1957.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I was considered
one of the top North American

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.430 align:middle line:90%
researchers.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.583 align:middle line:84%
That's because we never
did anything important.

00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:90%
We published a lot of papers.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.899 align:middle line:84%
A lot of paper, but
there's no value.

00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we began to
publish that we were getting

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.689 align:middle line:84%
results with niacin, you should
have seen the world collapse

00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:90%
about us.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:90%
They said, oh my god.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:90%
These guys are heretics.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And the mental
health business,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:84%
or their mental
illness business,

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is a multi-multi-billion
dollar business.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It generates profits that
are in the stratosphere,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%
obscene profits.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So, Dr. Hoffer and
his work and the work

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
of all these
extraordinary doctors

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is an extraordinary
threat to that industry.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.864 align:middle line:84%
And I think in their
greater and greater quest

00:29:15.864 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
for bigger and bigger
markets, because they've

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
kind of got everyone
in the States

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
on Prozac, half the
population, they've

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:90%
now pushed it to the limit.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you start damaging
little children's brains,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I think there's going
to be a backlash.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.768 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:29:32.768 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Family from Carmel,
their 12-year-old son was

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:90%
schizophrenic.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.089 align:middle line:84%
And his father, a doctor,
called me and was crying.

00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's wrong?

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, my son.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I've just been told
by his psychiatrist

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that he will never get
well, never get well.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.881 align:middle line:84%
And so when he was given
that horrible news,

00:30:02.881 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:84%
he began to spend as much time
as they could in the library.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:84%
He ran across the first paper
we ever published in 1957 where

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we first described
the use of vitamins

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
for the treatment
of schizophrenia.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, get a hold of some
niacin, and talk to his doctor.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he will agree
to put him on it.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I said to the son's
doctor, would you

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.149 align:middle line:90%
please try this niacin?

00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Told him what he knew about it.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The doctor was very
annoyed, very hostile.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately
issued two lies.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, first of all,
it'll fry his brain.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, secondly,
we have tried.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
If they had tried it,
and it didn't work,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:90%
why didn't they publish it?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
There was never a
single publication

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:90%
from them saying it didn't work.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.372 align:middle line:90%
They never tried it.

00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:49.836 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:49.836 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the
Saskatchewan plan

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
was to build hospitals that
would be really good hospitals,

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:84%
where people would be
held until they got well.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They would keep patients
even three to six, 12 months

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:90%
if necessary.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Then the drugs came along.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.980 align:middle line:84%
They were so dramatic
that psychiatry

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
began to think we don't
need these hospitals.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.557 align:middle line:84%
Their plan was not
to really build

00:31:43.557 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
a large number of smaller
institutions where

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.314 align:middle line:90%
they could house them properly.

00:31:47.314 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Their plan was simply
to put them all on drugs

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and discharge them.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.442 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, there was an
enormous feather in your cap

00:31:53.442 --> 00:31:54.900 align:middle line:84%
if the superintendent
of a hospital

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
could claim that he was
empty in his hospital

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.944 align:middle line:90%
faster than you were.

00:31:58.944 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
If you started off the
hospital with 2,000 patients,

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.839 align:middle line:84%
and five years later, you only
had 1,000, that was great news.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Where did these 1,000 go?

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They went onto the streets.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They went into
terrible nursing homes.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They went into terribly
undesirable places.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you have schizophrenia,
it's a life sentence.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:90%
You're never gonna change.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Your probably maybe
going to get worse.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:90%
We just have to medicate you.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you may be able
to limp along on a somewhat

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:84%
normal existence, but
totally medicated.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
like medications.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of side effects.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:90%
So they go off them.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, what we're dealing
with is a culture of life

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and a culture of death.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And a culture of life
is to try to supply

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the body with what it needs
and to keep away toxic things.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the culture of life
is an orthomolecular approach.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.420 align:middle line:84%
The culture of death is one
that focuses on profits.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
motivates everything.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's the financial
situation that

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is motivating the
development of the drugs

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and the paying dividends
to the stockholders

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what's important.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what drives things.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, this is
the future of medicine.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Number one, it works.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Number two, it's safe.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:90%
So why aren't we all doing this?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think the bottom
line is it is money.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical industry
have such a tight hold

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:90%
on medical training.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So, the average
doctor just simply

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:90%
doesn't learn this stuff.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they come
out of medical school,

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
they've got all this knowledge
about how to diagnose diseases

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and which drugs
to use and so on.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've often been taught
that particular nutrients just

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.020 align:middle line:90%
aren't effective.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, sort of
drug versus nutrient.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
this whole approach

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
is not about a different
kind of pill for an ill.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.922 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an entirely
different approach.

00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And then when you couple that
with the fact that you simply

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
cannot do orthomolecular
medicine in five minutes or 10

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
minutes, it really requires a
much longer and more detailed

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:84%
involvement with the patient
to really find out about

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:90%
their lifestyle.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:84%
And also when you find out
that it's relatively easy

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
to get someone to take a pill,
but to change a behavior is

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.540 align:middle line:84%
fundamental as eating, then
that really takes a lot of work.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So doctors are neither
trained in the science of this

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%

Investigation is
not really that hot

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:07.159 align:middle line:84%
because they don't do
much original stuff.

the original stuff

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%

seems to be valuable,

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.013 align:middle line:84%

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:84%
it's so much more logical
than the notion of throwing

of already existing chemical

it's clearly not delivering.

strongly at our 21st
century diet and lifestyle.

profession as a whole

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:90%

How is it possible for the

from flying off into space?

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.464 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have laws.

00:38:16.464 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:90%
We have the laws of gravity.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.838 align:middle line:90%
We have the laws of movement.

00:38:18.838 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Newton made those very clear.

But we don't understand
why they happen.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I think there is some kind of
unity in the whole universe.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.450 align:middle line:84%
How it came about, I don't
have the slightest idea.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.470 align:middle line:90%
But there is something.

to apply our knowledge
quickly as we go along.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Our aim is to get as many long
stay patients out as possible,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to keep new patients
so briefly that they

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:84%
did get cut off from
family and society, lastly,

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:90%
to keep them outside altogether.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:84%
We look forward to a
day, years away perhaps,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
when these great
buildings will no longer

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.634 align:middle line:84%
be needed to house backlogs
of long stay patients.

00:39:20.634 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we have
a new paradigm,

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
which is called
vitamin as treatment.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We initiated this whole
megavitamin concept.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Our work actually is
the first in the world

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to create public
attention to the fact

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.019 align:middle line:84%
that vitamins were
therapeutic in themselves,

00:39:34.019 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that you could use them for a
large number of conditions that

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:84%
were not considered vitamin
deficiency diseases,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and that you'd have to use them
in the right concentration.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:90%
There was no--

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:84%
God didn't say you must only
use thiamine in tiny milligrams.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
God said, if you have thiamine,
use it as you need it.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:84%
If you have vitamin C,
use it as you need it.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was the major thing.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that's going
to revolutionize medicine,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
starting to do that now.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
It led to the
orthomolecular treatment

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that arose from the
adrenochrome hypothesis.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this paradigm change,

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.866 align:middle line:84%
we now have a treatment
for schizophrenia,

00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:09.740 align:middle line:90%
which is not perfect.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's awful better--

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.830 align:middle line:84%
certainly a lot better
than just using drugs.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
So, I think I would hope that
my major contribution one day

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
will be that I was one of
the pioneers in helping

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
create the new vitamin
as treatment paradigm.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.966 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.966 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have the answer.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.965 align:middle line:84%
But one day, we're going
to have the answers.

00:40:30.965 --> 00:40:35.989 align:middle line:84%
And when orthomolecular medicine
has taken over all of medicine,

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:84%
instead of spending billions
of dollars examining

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
one drug after
another that's toxic,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.165 align:middle line:84%
we will now start
to look exactly

00:40:42.165 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
at each particular
disease and find out

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
what are the needs for
that particular disease.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:47.799 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going to happen.

00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:52.789 align:middle line:90%
