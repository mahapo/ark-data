and these civilizations are
waiting for us to do it.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:90%
And so this is our opportunity.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:90%
This is our moment.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And it really is we the
people that have to do it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.655 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, for decades, only
crackpots and crazy people

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:10%
believed in UFOs.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:10%
That's what I thought, anyway.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:10%
And then in recent
years, it turns out

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:10%
that governments
have been taking them

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:10%
seriously all along.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Very seriously.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is often
asked, when will UFO disclosure

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The answer is it has
already happened.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:10%
It happened in 2001 at
the National Press Club

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:10%
in Washington, DC,
where military, NASA,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:10%
and intelligence
agency whistle blowers

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:10%
testified to their involvement
in the UFO cover up

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and the back engineering of
extraterrestrial technologies.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:10%
It happened again in 2017,
with the release of the film

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:10%
"Unacknowledged", in
anticipation of which,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:10%
the CIA and the FBI published
millions of UFO documents

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:10%
on their website sites.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Despite all this, nothing
has really changed.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:10%
Life goes on as
before, except there

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:10%
is a new narrative unfolding in
the mainstream media, one that

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:10%
is designed to subvert
true disclosure

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:10%
and extinguish the
opportunity for transformation

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:10%
available to us through
these revelations.

>> Earlier this week,
the "New York Times"

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and Politico revealed
the existence of a secret

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
government program to
investigate UFO sightings.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It was especially focused
on encounters by members

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
of the military, like this one
experienced by a US Navy pilot

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of California.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Look at that thing!

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>> It's rotating.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Average people
see UFOs on the news.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden it's real.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:10%
UFOs, we've been
tracking them in the sky.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And they go, OK, well were
the tinfoil hat people right?

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:10%
It took a long time for
the mainstream media

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:10%
to finally admit that, yeah, you
know, they are, in fact, real.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Why did we wait that long?

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Why did we wait for
the mainstream media

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.605 align:middle line:84%
to tell us before we
finally believed, hey,

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:90%
this is actually happening?

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is, if
there's potentially multiple

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:84%
narratives, how do you
decide which one to go with?

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in the 1990s, I was read
into or briefed on a project

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that involved an interagency
group that had the ability

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
to disclose the ET presence
in a way that would frighten

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
everyone on Earth and convince
the public that there was

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
an "alien threat," which
is completely false.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all a lie.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And that this had been
developed in the '50s,

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and they had been
developing the means

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and the psychological
warfare to make that happen.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1990s, I wrote
a paper called "When

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Disclosure Serves Secrecy".

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
What that means is there are
two kinds of disclosures that

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
might happen; a truthful one
that is also a hopeful one,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
which is what I gave up
my medical career to try

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:90%
to actuate and do.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
the one that is spun

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:10%
by the spinmeisters
in Washington

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:10%
and at the Pentagon and
CIA, which runs like this.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:10%
"It's true that UFOs are real.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:10%
They are here as a threat.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:10%
They're violating our airspace.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They're a national security
threat, and a threat

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:90%
to our sovereignty."

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm quoting.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose of the program,
Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Identification Program, was
really designed to do just

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:10%
From a national
security perspective,

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:10%
identify those
things that we see,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:10%
and try to ascertain
and determine

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:10%
if that information
is a potential threat

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:10%
to national security.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And we knew this
was going to happen,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
because I had met with people
who were in these classified

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
projects who were on interagency
committees that had everything

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.053 align:middle line:90%
set to roll this out.

00:16:08.053 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were just waiting
for the right time.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
The Soviet Union has ended.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We have the global terrorism
while it's still there.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it
was around 9/11.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the next "big
thing" that they want

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
the public to be afraid of.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:10%
>> When a pickpocket
meets a saint,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:10%
all he sees are his pockets.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:10%
Or, like, if you're a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not that this isn't
a genuine perception

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:10%
on their part, because
they've been raised--

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:10%
their entire political
and professional career

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:10%
has been designed to have this
kind of artificial construct

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:10%
of this.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
There's this national
airspace, and nobody

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:84%
can come into the
airspace unless we say so.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.573 align:middle line:84%
And they've got this super
control mechanism going.

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're right at this really
important place right now where

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:84%
they're attempting to
establish any kind of one world

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, that they've gotten
the communications systems up,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:90%
the transportation systems up.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:10%
They want to establish
a planetary government.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
that is going

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
to motivate the creation
of a one world government

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
like the discovery
of an ultimate other.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:10%
Ronald Reagan, standing in
front of the United Nations,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:10%
the Senate, right out.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:10%
would vanish if we were
facing an alien threat

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:10%
from outside this world.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> He was silly
enough to say it.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
part of his naivete.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
is their agenda.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Legendary civil rights
attorney Daniel Sheehan has

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
spent over 50 years fighting
the national security state.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon Papers and
the Iran-Contra scandals

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are but two of his
many landmark cases

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
before becoming a whistle
blower and legal counsel

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
for the Disclosure
Project in 2001.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's helpful, of course, for
them to say, oh, UFOs are real.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:10%
That's quite helpful.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:10%
We've been trying to get
people to understand that now

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:10%
for the last 30 years.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.973 align:middle line:10%
But it's all immediately
wedded to this fact

00:18:05.973 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:10%
that they're this
horrible threat.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And so we have to come
forward with a positive set

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:10%
of programs, a positive
vision for this.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm trying to help

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
get the Vatican and
the Jesuit Order

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to become involved
in, in putting forth

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
a discussion about the
theological and philosophical

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
challenges that
this presents to us.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a national
security threat, you know?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not a threat
to our species.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.233 align:middle line:90%
It's not a threat to our planet.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a threat to our
view as ourselves as the

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
be all and end all, that the
entire universe was created

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
as a stage on which to play
out the human drama of one

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%
single species.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, that ain't so,
but let's get used to it.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:10%
And let's figure out
what the new story is.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%
What is the new story?

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It is a positive story.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:90%
What is our role in it?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
We may not be the
star of it, but we're

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
a good supporting character in
the unfolding of our universe.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And let's figure out
what that story is.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The success of
"Unacknowledged",

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
which has been seen by hundreds
of millions of people now.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you not watched
"Unacknowledged"?

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> What is "Unacknowledged"?

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to watch
"Unacknowledged".

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that one?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, you've got to
watch "Unacknowledged".

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:10%
>> You've got to watch
"Unacknowledged".

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that that
Steven Greer movie?

00:19:15.758 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Caused a reaction within
the intelligence community

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what the major
media has begun to do

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is to cooperate with
the intelligence

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
community in reporting
all this information out,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
but with this peculiar spin,
very subliminal at this stage,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%
that it's a threat.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The project was called
the Advanced Aviation Threat

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:10%
Identification Program, run
by an official named Luis

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:10%
Elizondo.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this is a
national security imperative.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:10%
We have clear things
that we do not

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:10%
understand how they
work operating in areas

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:10%
that we can't control.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>> One of my first cases coming
out of law school was for NBC

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:10%
to establish the right
of journalists to protect

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:10%
their confidential news sources.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:10%
I did the amicus briefs
for the "New York

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:10%
Times" and the "Washington
Post" and also for CBS and ABC.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:10%
And it was at that
time that I began

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:10%
to realize that there was this
close working relationship

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:10%
between the board of editors
of the "New York Times"

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.465 align:middle line:10%
and the National
Security community,

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:10%
that there's
conversations going on all

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:10%
the time between
the board of editors

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:10%
and the national
security people.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:10%
And we actually got an
affidavit from Teddy Sorensen

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:10%
saying, oh yes, the national
security state and CIA

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:10%
and everybody consult regularly
with the "New York Times"

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:10%
to get them not to
tell information

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:10%
about covert operations
that we're engaged in.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to find
that out at that point.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I began to do an
investigation about this

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
as the lawyer for the
"Times" now and for NBC,

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and found out that there were 42
full time Central Intelligence

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:54.302 align:middle line:84%
Agency or NSA people employed by
the major national news media.

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
whole entire project

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
called Project Mockingbird.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.555 align:middle line:10%
And they were deeply embedded
with major national news media.

00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were constantly,
from their point of view,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
safeguarding of the
information that was

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:90%
going to be allowed to get out.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite clear
that they viewed themselves

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as all part of the
same basic fraternity.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
They all shared in
the patriotic vision

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.702 align:middle line:84%
being able to go
around the world.

00:21:19.702 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing we had the biggest
challenge with on the Pentagon

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Papers case is they
didn't want to reveal

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there was
a massive assassination

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:90%
program going on.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was being funded
by heroin trafficking

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to keep it away from the
Congressional funding

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:90%
investigations, et cetera.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:10%
I thought this was a terribly
newsworthy thing to tell about,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:10%
but it was beyond the pale.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:10%
That was not to be
talked about here.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:10%
You can talk about how bad
the Vietnam War was, and even

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:10%
the fact that they lied about
the Bay of Tonkin incident,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:10%
but not this.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations officer

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Richard Doty admitted that
he would bring bags of cash

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
to national security editors
in the major media to get

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
their cooperation
in this narrative.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So every news agency, every
television and radio station

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:10%
in the Albuquerque or Santa Fe
area had our snitches in there.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:90%
So we knew.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And we paid them.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
We paid them good money.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons you get
to people is you pay them.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was controversial.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
That was somewhat controversial.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you know of national
media that have had similar--

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yes.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to name them.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What you have now is a
concerted effort between

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
mainstream media,
social media platforms,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and tech giants to say,
let's gain control back

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of the narratives that we
require to make sure that we

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
can control how people
think about certain topics.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So now you have
this fear driven.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You have this tight
little box of what

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the UFO and extraterrestrial
subject is really about,

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
how it relates to military,
government spending, weapons,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
all the sort of
conversations that

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are very common
in the mainstream

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that people are going to
relate to, that they--

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, I can piece the
typical dots together.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me give you
a great example.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:10%
If you look at a lot of the
Disclosure Project materials,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:10%
which is beyond the
scope of this film,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:10%
we identified
dozens of people who

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:10%
were at intercontinental
ballistic missile

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:10%
nuclear silos, nuclear weapons
areas, who had had UFOs come in

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:10%
to those areas surveilling them
and in some cases rendering

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:10%
those missiles unlaunchable.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the men
that were in those silos

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:84%
have said to me
personally they felt

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that these ETs were saying,
please don't blow up

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful planet.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you do, if you go to
mutual assured destruction,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the full launch of
nuclear weapons globally,

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we can intercept
a lot of them so

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that you don't go to a full
extinction level event.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
They felt that it was actually
a very hopeful thing that

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, people came
along, took the same data,

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the same cases, and spun it
into a national security threat.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
One set of facts, two narratives
diametrically opposed.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Opposite.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got involved in
the issue of the UFO issue

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and the ET issue, that started
in 1977 with President Carter.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the
work that I was doing

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
was characterized by the
national security state

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:84%
as a target for
counterintelligence activities.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.258 align:middle line:10%
When I see this thing happening
with this To The Stars Academy,

00:24:29.258 --> 00:24:31.800 align:middle line:10%
where they suddenly appear on
the front page of the "New York

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Times", and CNN all of a
sudden wants to talk with them.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're on MSNBC and
all this kind of stuff.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I immediately kind of
realized, wait a second.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:84%
This is part of what I've
been worried about coming out,

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because they were constantly
spinning this story that this

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:90%
is a threat.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Tom DeLonge.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people know me
from my band blink-182.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I started that
band when I was 16.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Through a series of meetings,
I was soon connected to a large

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:84%
group of US government
officials from the CIA,

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Defense, and
Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
These guys were
the ones involved

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
in the secret of US
government programs

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:90%
that dealt with these subjects.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.395 align:middle line:84%
>> What's happening is To
The Stars Academy people,

00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
who were all-- you know,
Jim Semivan, who's there.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
The chief of covert
operations domestic for CIA,

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
which in and of itself
is totally against law.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, the National Security
Act of 1947 completely,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
clearly, and unequivocally
prohibits any kind

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:90%
of covert operations stateside.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:90%
But here that's who he is.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And there he is there.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:10%
And you got the guys from
the DIA, and the Defense

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Department, and Hal Puthoff.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And they're all there.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is they're

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:90%
putting this intense spin.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:10%
Every single thing
they talk about all

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:10%
has this kind of gestalt to
it, that this is a threat.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And it very well
could be a threat.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a threat to
our national security.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a threat to our air space.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a threat to
our sovereignty.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
What it is, it's a threat to our
dominion over our own planet.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
think that's their job.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:10%

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
and not for the
reasons you think.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this
is interesting.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Finally we got together in
New York City in July of 1994.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, in
1989, a group of us

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:90%
were trying to do disclosure.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
And it involved Gorbachev,
President Bush Senior, himself,

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:84%
and the UN Secretary
General Perez de Cuellar.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of us putting
together high level planning

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:84%
meetings to do this, Perez
de Cuellar, the UN Secretary

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
General, was "abducted" out
of his limousine in Manhattan.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
He was told by the "aliens"
that if they did not

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
cease and desist
from their plans

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to disclose this
information, that every world

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
leader involved, including the
President of the United States,

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:90%
would be abducted.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:84%
This blew up like an atomic
bomb in the Bush White House,

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and it did not go forward.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, well, tell me more.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:10%
He says, "well, we've
concluded that we

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:10%
have to prepare the public
for an interplanetary war.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
we can then also

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
force the return of Christ."

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm quoting.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And I just listened.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know that I knew that
the means for that abduction

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:84%
for Perez de Cuellar were run by
a counterintelligence unit out

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of the national security state
that had the technologies

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to simulate an alien
craft and aliens,

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
run completely by
military assets.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And that there was a deeper part
of these unacknowledged special

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
access projects that were
zooming even people like Bush

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Senior, who was
on the committee,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but had lost control of some
of these renegade factions.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
complicated story.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Perez de Cuellar
being abducted caused

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:90%
him to stop that process.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It manipulated these leaders
into going onto a war footing.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And he confessed to
me that the reason

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
he was funding the work
of the abduction groups

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.390 align:middle line:84%
was because they wanted
to put information out

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to the public that would scare
the public so that people would

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
make the sacrifice
in blood and treasure

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:90%
to have an interplanetary war.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.485 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is 25 years ago.

00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It was not a happy
meeting for me.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's any one thing
that is going to mobilize people

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
to allow the national security
state to establish full

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
spectrum dominance over
our planet, it is this.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The beings themselves,
interestingly

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and very importantly, are
putting out their own story.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not doing that yet.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
us to understand it.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.028 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
give us warnings.

00:37:01.028 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to help raise
our consciousness, which

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is a critical part of this
entire operation going on,

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.908 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get us to
do this for ourselves.

00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what this-- that's
what this is all about.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But the national
security state realizes

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:90%
that that's a slower process.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So they're now trying
to hurry this up.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of an emergency
process underway right now.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake about that.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was briefing the
director of the Defense

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency, the
very first thing he asked

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:90%
wasn't about this subject.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:90%
He looked at me.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.380 align:middle line:84%
He says, Dr. Greer,
what we don't understand

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is why you haven't
killed yourself yet.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, my dad knew
about some of this way

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:90%
back in the '60s.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:84%
No one would do
anything about it.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So he took his revolver and ate
his gun and blew his head off.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.055 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
three-star general

00:37:49.055 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
telling me this story
in the first 10 minutes

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:90%
we're together.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm sorry
that happened to you.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I understand where your
dad was coming from.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Because it's sort of this--

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the truth is, there
are a lot of people who've

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:84%
been on my team who were
military who killed themselves,

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:84%
others who have
been assassinated.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing
that keeps me up

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
is, you know,
survivor guilt. Sorry.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This national security
state is the bane of our human

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:90%
existence right now.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
start disassembling

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.020 align:middle line:90%
that national security state.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
even assuming, say,

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Bernie Sanders, hypothetically,
were to become president.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
The national
security state isn't

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:84%
going to tell him where
the washrooms are.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.150 align:middle line:84%
That whole group is going
to descend upon him,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to give
him at least as much trouble

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:90%
as they've given Trump.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>> If you got into the office,
and you found out something

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:10%
about aliens, if you found
out something about UFOs,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:10%
would you let us know?

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'll tell you.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:10%
My wife would demand
that I let you know.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.260 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's why they want Joe
Biden and Kamala Harris to come

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.070 align:middle line:10%
in and kind of, you know, get
things, quote, "back to normal"

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.123 align:middle line:10%
where the national security
state is functioning.

00:39:43.123 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They're all operation.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're all going
to brief Goldman Sachs,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're putting
people from Goldman Sachs

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.340 align:middle line:90%
in charge of the economy.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of thing.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.240 align:middle line:10%
We have to rise above those
kind of dialectical politics

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:10%
and bring the people up, raise
the conscious of the people,

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:10%
and have this function
through democracy.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got
the tools here.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:90%
They're in front of us.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And we've got access
to the internet still.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They haven't taken
that away from us yet.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.230 align:middle line:90%
But there's a short window here.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.040 align:middle line:10%
>> One exception to the almost
universal failure of world

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:10%
governments to initiate peaceful
diplomacy with ET civilizations

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:10%
took place in France in 2007.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Then-President Sarkozy's
Ministry of Defense

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:10%
reached out to Dr. Greer to
train its senior officials

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:10%
in the close encounters of
the fifth kind protocols.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
During a covert test run
in the French countryside,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
ET craft were tracked
overhead going

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.460 align:middle line:90%
200,000 kilometers per hour.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.590 align:middle line:84%
This massive,
mauve-colored craft

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:53.080 align:middle line:84%
partially materialized a
few meters from the group.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Since the operation was swiftly
halted by national security

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:84%
state interests, it
remains the duty of we,

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
the people to become peaceful
ambassadors to the universe.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Much like a denial of
service cyber attack

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
can bottleneck and bring
down a computer network,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
millions of people
initiating contact

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:84%
would completely overwhelm
the national security state's

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:90%
ability to subvert disclosure.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The national
security state people,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in potentially working with
and through the To The Stars

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Academy are going to be
pitching this problem.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.490 align:middle line:10%
Say, well, you
know, we can't just

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:39.030 align:middle line:10%
let our whole civilization
know that there is this highly

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:10%
advanced, technologically
superior society out there,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:10%
because our whole
culture will collapse.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:10%
Whereas in fact,
it's quite clear

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:10%
that it's their
defense of the elite,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.560 align:middle line:10%
this 1% of the human family
that basically ends up

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:10%
controlling over 40%
of all the wealth

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.110 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, that
they're really defending.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It is their world that
they're trying to defend.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So that you see that this
is a subset of a larger

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
question about how spiritual
consciousness and the evolution

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.410 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
of understanding

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:84%
what we really are in the
makeup of the universe

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is a threat in
itself to this elite.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the
dissolving away of these kind

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:90%
of differences among ourselves.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And this coming into a full
ownership of our proper place

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:84%
in the universe puts
these people out

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:90%
of business as the ruling elite.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the raising
of consciousness

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of our human family is so
closely related to the opening

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.740 align:middle line:84%
onto the extraterrestrial
experience that both of them

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.830 align:middle line:84%
together are viewed as
a threat by the elite.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
What they're afraid of is that
this is such an accelerator.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.560 align:middle line:84%
As people have these
repeated contacts

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrials,
their whole consciousness

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:90%
starts to rise.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They start becoming
aware of the fact

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.192 align:middle line:84%
that we're damaging
our environment.

00:43:02.192 --> 00:43:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They become aware of the fact
that nuclear weapons are kind

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:90%
of an insane thing to have.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.380 align:middle line:90%
War is a really bad idea.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a spiritual experience.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
stimulation is coming.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take someone from
Italy and someone from Japan,

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:84%
very different cultures,
very different people,

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:84%
personalities, backgrounds,
emotional temperament.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Now extrapolate that
out across the cosmos.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Think of the vast differences
there are going to be.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:84%
How do we make any sense
of that if we aren't

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
anchored into something deeper?

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And that point of
commonality has

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:90%
been folded within each of us.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we are
awake, conscious beings.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.940 align:middle line:90%
They are awake.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:90%
We are awake.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.010 align:middle line:84%
That faculty of being aware of
awareness, the consciousness.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Not what you're conscious of,
but the means to be awake.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:90%
That is a singularity.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And once we're anchored into
that state of consciousness,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the unitive state, then
there aren't any aliens.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.470 align:middle line:84%
There are just other people who
are a little different from us.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:05.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the point where we
can make contact most easily.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.280 align:middle line:10%
When I looked at "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind",

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, somebody
knows what's going on here.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:10%
Because it had a lot to
do with the telepathy,

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.000 align:middle line:10%
the sort of dreams
people had that led them

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:10%
to the Devils Tower in Wyoming.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.520 align:middle line:10%
All of this.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I then found out that
Spielberg had actually

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.790 align:middle line:84%
had a man, Jay Allen Hynek,
who was head of Project Blue

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Book for the Air Force, who was
the chief consultant who opened

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
up files for him so he
could make that movie almost

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:90%
like a docudrama.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2011, a CE-5 group at
Joshua Tree National Park

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:09.400 align:middle line:84%
successfully contacted an
entire flotilla of ET craft.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
In the unprocessed
night vision footage,

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
we see what appears to
be two distinct craft.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.650 align:middle line:84%
But image enhancements
reveal that these

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.935 align:middle line:84%
are two parts of a
superstructure or mother

00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:24.865 align:middle line:84%
ship surrounded by an
entire fleet of ET vehicles.

00:45:24.865 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.990 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It is not possible to simply
crowbar extraterrestrials

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.200 align:middle line:84%
into our traditional, relatively
primitive, view of reality.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.090 align:middle line:84%
In order to make
sense of things,

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, in order to make
contact, we have to pause

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and readdress our assumptions
about the very nature

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.460 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.910 align:middle line:10%
This is an essential
reflection which

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.700 align:middle line:10%
reveals that the mystery
of extraterrestrials

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.820 align:middle line:10%
is but a signpost that
points to a far more

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.380 align:middle line:10%
profound and intimate secret,
one with the power to transform

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.470 align:middle line:10%
us and the cosmos forever.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>> One day, I went
to my mailbox,

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.058 align:middle line:10%
and I got out a little flyer.

00:46:11.058 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:10%
And it said we're inviting
you to a meeting with Ben

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:10%
Rich, the chairman and
CEO of Lockheed Skunk

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.368 align:middle line:10%
Works, former UCLA alumni.

00:46:19.368 --> 00:46:21.160 align:middle line:10%
He'll be speaking to
the engineering alumni

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:10%
group about his time
at the Skunk Works.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So as he was finishing his
talk after about 45 minutes,

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:31.300 align:middle line:84%
his last slide was a black disk
zipping off into outer space.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And he ended the talk
by saying, we now

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
have the technology
to take ET home.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And the whole room
burst out laughing.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.770 align:middle line:90%
We said, did he just say that?

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And as he was walking
away, I followed him.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Ben, Ben.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:84%
He turned around
and looked at me.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Ben.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.782 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm really fascinated
with what you had to say today.

00:46:48.782 --> 00:46:50.765 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd really
love to know how these

00:46:50.765 --> 00:46:51.890 align:middle line:90%
craft-- how we would do it.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
What would we use
to get to the stars?

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.460 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me, trying to
figure out who I was, I think,

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well, let
me ask you a question.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.430 align:middle line:90%
How does ESP work?

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was really taken
aback, because frankly, I

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:90%
was asking a question.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting
get a question back.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.005 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
popped in my mind was

00:47:08.005 --> 00:47:10.080 align:middle line:84%
all points in space
and time are connected.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So I fired that
answer back to him.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.780 align:middle line:84%
All points in space
and time are connected.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's how it works.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:84%
He turned around
and he walked away.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:10%
>> This astonishing admission
from a top military industrial

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:23.620 align:middle line:10%
complex insider proves to
be much more than a simple

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:10%
analogy.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:28.270 align:middle line:84%
The physics of UFOs, how
they travel and communicate

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:31.750 align:middle line:84%
through interstellar distances,
how they generate power,

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:84%
how they're manufactured,
is beyond the grasp

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of unclassified
mainstream science.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead, a model of reality
that accounts for ESP

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is the only model in
which we can begin

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.940 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend ET technology.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're traveling
beyond the speed of light,

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I call it the crossing
point of light,

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:84%
it's like beyond
the sound barrier.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something
beyond the light barrier.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're going from,
say, the Andromeda galaxy,

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that's 2 and 1/2 million
light years away.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So at the speed
of light, it would

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.458 align:middle line:84%
take 2 and 1/2 million
years for them to get here.

00:48:06.458 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:90%
The speed of light is too slow.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go from point A to
B through the cosmos through

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.410 align:middle line:84%
a linear system
of transportation.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, you cannot communicate
through those distances with

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:84%
something at the speed of light,
which is what your cell phone

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and all these radio frequency
electromagnetic communication

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:84%
devices we use now
on Earth, are using.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Any civilization
that is here that is

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.680 align:middle line:84%
interstellar by definition
is transdimensional.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.290 align:middle line:84%
They're passing through
other dimensions

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and dropping out of linearity
and going from A to B,

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:84%
boom, almost like
a teleportation,

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.420 align:middle line:84%
where it's that resonant
effect from point A to B.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Any communications systems
that these ETs have

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:84%
are also going at the speed
of not light, but of thought.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Quanta of thought.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.800 align:middle line:84%
We think of
consciousness and thought

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
as this sort of amorphous,
irrelevant, interesting but

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:90%
mystical thing.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But the central operating
system and communication system

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.060 align:middle line:84%
for all interstellar
civilizations

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness and
thought and technologies

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:90%
that interface with them.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:10%
>> God, prana, chi,
magic, consciousness.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Every culture throughout
history has had a word

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:32.020 align:middle line:84%
to describe this intangible
energy that connects

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.020 align:middle line:90%
everyone and everything.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Decades of laboratory
studies show

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that our minds have a
mysterious ordering effect

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.150 align:middle line:90%
on quantum level phenomena.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Despite overwhelming
scientific evidence,

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:84%
most people would
still be shocked

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to learn that certain scientists
have known that the force is

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.460 align:middle line:90%
real for a very long time.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the people that I
met in the course of doing this

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.460 align:middle line:84%
work was astronaut
Edgar Mitchell,

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.070 align:middle line:84%
who was the sixth man
to walk on the moon.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:10%
>> We had sightings
of all sorts.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.675 align:middle line:10%
There seems to have been a great
deal of secrecy surrounding

00:50:09.675 --> 00:50:11.740 align:middle line:10%
a so-called UFO event.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> He had an
experience in space,

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:84%
an expanded state
of consciousness,

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that led him to form the
Institute of Noetic Sciences

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to study the science
of consciousness.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I also brought him
to the briefing

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I did in 1997 with the
head of intelligence

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.210 align:middle line:84%
for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Admiral Tom Wilson.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:84%
The data on that has
since leaked out.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell realized
there was this connection

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.270 align:middle line:84%
between space and these
extraterrestrial life forms

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and the science of
consciousness that

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.750 align:middle line:90%
was very integral to the study.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people
that I have met

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.680 align:middle line:84%
with in senior science, NASA,
aerospace, and intelligence

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.510 align:middle line:84%
community figures know that
the key missing ingredient

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.670 align:middle line:84%
note of most people's
understanding of the whole UFO

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon is the
science of consciousness.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The ETs are trying to
encourage people to understand

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.430 align:middle line:84%
higher consciousness
and universal mind

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have a
relationship with them that's

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:90%
going forward into the future.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Mitchell realized
that quite early on because

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.565 align:middle line:84%
of his own personal experience
out in space as the sixth man

00:51:18.565 --> 00:51:19.660 align:middle line:90%
to walk on the moon.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the nature of
the universe we live in?

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.390 align:middle line:84%
What is our relationship
to the larger reality?

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:30.430 align:middle line:84%
If that's a part of the larger
reality, and we're denying it,

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that to me is unconscionable.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> "I theorize that there is
a spectrum of consciousness

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.890 align:middle line:90%
available to human beings.

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:84%
At one end is material
consciousness.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:46.240 align:middle line:84%
At the other end is what we
call field consciousness, where

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.820 align:middle line:84%
a person is at one
with the universe,

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.260 align:middle line:90%
perceiving the universe.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at our
planet on the way back,

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw or felt a field
consciousness state."

Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> We've thought for a long time
that the closer we could look

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.720 align:middle line:84%
at the operations of cells
in our body and our brains,

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.760 align:middle line:84%
the closer we'd come to finding
the location of consciousness.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And while there's
been fantastic work

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.550 align:middle line:84%
at mapping neural connections
and understanding more and more

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:17.670 align:middle line:84%
about the brain and memory, what
we find is that we still don't

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.100 align:middle line:90%
know where consciousness is.

inventor and entrepreneur whose

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.520 align:middle line:84%
groundbreaking work as a
teenager caught the eye

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of Princeton's Dean of
Engineering, Dr. Robert Jahn.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jahn recruited Adam into the
Princeton Engineering Anomalies

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Research Lab, where they studied
the mysterious ordering effect

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness on quantum
systems, an effect they

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:90%
called mind-matter interaction.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, a non localized picture
is the picture of consciousness

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.820 align:middle line:10%
on which we're converging
now, which is to say that

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:10%
consciousness does not seem
to be strictly produced

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:55.660 align:middle line:10%
by the brain.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.940 align:middle line:84%
It involves the brain,
but there's something

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.560 align:middle line:90%
much deeper going on here.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness may not be
localized to our bodies,

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.250 align:middle line:84%
but maybe a fundamental
feature of the physical world

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.750 align:middle line:90%
in which we live.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:11.470 align:middle line:84%

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness, this faculty
of being sentient, awake,

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
is not limited to our
brainwaves or our bodies,

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but in fact transcends
the limits of space time,

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.730 align:middle line:84%
this unbounded
field of awareness.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is true whether
you recognize it or not.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it doesn't matter
if you intellectualize it.

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.580 align:middle line:84%
That is the reality
of it that has

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.850 align:middle line:84%
been proven through scientific
studies, such as Dr. Jahn's

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.610 align:middle line:84%
work at Princeton where
they would have people put

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:50.920 align:middle line:84%
their awareness on a random
number generator that's

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.770 align:middle line:84%
spitting out zeros
and ones randomly,

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and would intend to shift
it, say, towards zeros,

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and it would shift without
any linear wires, just

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.460 align:middle line:90%
their thought.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Essentially what a random
number generator does is it

00:54:02.793 --> 00:54:05.590 align:middle line:84%
looks at something intrinsically
random in the physical world,

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:06.850 align:middle line:90%
typically a quantum process.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:10.150 align:middle line:10%
And it converts those into
a string of ones and zeros.

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it kind
of like a coin flip, where

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:90%
heads is one and tails is zero.

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you collect a
large enough sample size,

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.890 align:middle line:84%
you find a 50-50 distribution
of these ones and zeros,

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:24.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning physical reality is
behaving the way it should.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you get somebody
in front of a machine

00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and you ask them to
use their intention

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to mean shift the thing to
more ones or more zeros,

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.390 align:middle line:84%
what you find is that there's,
not all the time, but often

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.710 align:middle line:84%
a significant mean shift in the
direction of their intention.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
simple experiment.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But the implications
are absolutely profound.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.320 align:middle line:84%
That suggests that, in
fact, consciousness does not

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:52.000 align:middle line:84%
seem to be just an illusion or
just a localized phenomenon,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.460 align:middle line:84%
but that it does have
some sort of capabilities

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to affect the probabilities at
the deepest layer of reality

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.260 align:middle line:84%
down in the basement layer
in the quantum world somehow.

>> The best way to understand
nonlocality is to understand

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that in both physics
and in consciousness,

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:29.500 align:middle line:84%
there is a connection that
exists amongst all things,

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.800 align:middle line:84%
from photons to
people to awareness,

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that isn't limited by
space and time per se,

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that are woven
within each other.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.470 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Emoto, the
Japanese scientist,

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:44.290 align:middle line:10%
began to experiment
with water and people

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:10%
putting their
intent on the water.

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.240 align:middle line:10%
And he did
photography that would

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.670 align:middle line:10%
show these different
crystalline structures.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:54.070 align:middle line:10%
If it was a very
negative emotion,

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.590 align:middle line:10%
the crystals would
be all dissonant.

00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:00.220 align:middle line:10%
But when it was highly
order conscious, or love,

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:04.090 align:middle line:10%
the structures were these
beautiful ordered structures

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:10%
that he would photograph.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.870 align:middle line:10%
And this was repeated
by other scientists.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:10%
Water has a
crystalline component,

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:14.200 align:middle line:10%
but it's also tied into-- like
all matter in space and time

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.470 align:middle line:10%
in the universe-- to this
consciousness force field.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:20.770 align:middle line:10%
If you enter into just a
quiet state of consciousness

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:10%
and intend something
very positive,

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:27.040 align:middle line:10%
it literally altered the
structure of the water itself.

>> Nonlocality is au
courant with modern physics.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:10%
Schrodinger talked about
nonlocality and entanglement

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:41.830 align:middle line:10%
in the 1920s, but it
really wasn't until 1970

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.230 align:middle line:10%
that Freedman and
Clauser at Berkeley

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:10%
discovered that photons born
together like identical twins

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.340 align:middle line:10%
can move off into the
distance from one another.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And you grab one twin, and
you change the polarization

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.110 align:middle line:84%
of the other, even though
they're very, very far apart.

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And the lingo describing
this in modern physics

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:09.390 align:middle line:84%
is we would say they're
entangled with one another.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:11.650 align:middle line:84%
There was an
unpublished experiment

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that we did at the PEAR Lab,
which we called Plant RNG.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.170 align:middle line:90%
You have a room with no windows.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have a house plant
that needs light to grow.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a single growing
light up on the roof.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.190 align:middle line:10%
The growing light can turn
in one of four quadrants,

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.110 align:middle line:10%
and which quadrant
that light is showing

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:31.360 align:middle line:10%
is controlled by a
random number generator.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:10%
So you put the plant in
one corner of the room.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.130 align:middle line:10%
The light has an equal
chance of shining in all four

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:39.305 align:middle line:10%
coordinates, but you
give it enough time,

00:57:39.305 --> 00:57:40.930 align:middle line:10%
and what you find is
the light actually

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.390 align:middle line:10%
shines far more often
on the plant than

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.680 align:middle line:10%
on the other coordinates.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.910 align:middle line:10%
It's as though life itself,
even life or consciousness

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:50.710 align:middle line:10%
in something as
simple as a house

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:10%
plant, bends probabilities
in the physical world

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.030 align:middle line:10%
in the direction
of what it needs,

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:57.610 align:middle line:10%
in the direction of its
growth and its evolution.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I see that experiment
as profound,

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:84%
because it shows to
me what consciousness

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.000 align:middle line:90%
does in the world.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> How could ESP work?

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Does ESP violate any physics?

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you can't
violate the laws of physics.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Not like going
through a stop sign.

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
phenomenon, physics

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.890 align:middle line:84%
has to change to agree
with your phenomena.

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest interest
in classified intelligence

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:25.540 align:middle line:84%
projects has to do with the
science of consciousness,

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.770 align:middle line:84%
because even during the Cold
War and before, World War Two,

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:33.040 align:middle line:84%
they realized that there
were people on the other side

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of some of those conflicts that
were very adept at what's now

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:38.860 align:middle line:84%
called remote viewing, the
ability to use consciousness

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.860 align:middle line:90%
to spy on a remote place.

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:84%
These programs began to
be studied scientifically,

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and then routinized,
made routine,

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.510 align:middle line:84%
in the intelligence community
back in the '40s, '50s, '60s.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You could say my spiritual
development was paid

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.840 align:middle line:84%
for by the CIA, a very
unusual situation.

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:03.490 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1972, Dr. Russell Targ, a
laser physicist at the Lockheed

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Missile and Space Company,
joined the Stanford Research

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Institute to begin a CIA-funded
psychic espionage program using

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:15.100 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing to gather
intelligence on distant

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.930 align:middle line:10%
targets.

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So we had a 20-year program
at Stanford in which we worked

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:25.500 align:middle line:84%
with the CIA to describe
what the Russians,

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.300 align:middle line:90%
what the Chinese were doing.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And we were
forecasting on a Monday

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:34.710 align:middle line:84%
whether the market would go up
or down the following Friday.

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And we made nine forecasts
like that nine weeks in a row,

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.745 align:middle line:90%
and they were all correct.

00:59:40.745 --> 00:59:44.850 align:middle line:10%
We made $120,000, and on the
front page of the "Wall Street

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Journal."

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So back in 1982, when we were
making money on Wall Street,

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.600 align:middle line:90%
ESP was real.

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> "Everyone who is seriously
interested in the pursuit

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of science becomes convinced
that a spirit is manifest

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:07.170 align:middle line:84%
in the laws of the universe, a
spirit vastly superior to man,

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and one in the face of which
our modest powers must seem

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.055 align:middle line:90%
humble."

01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:12.855 align:middle line:90%
Albert Einstein.

01:00:12.855 --> 01:00:15.460 align:middle line:90%


01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't invent
remote viewing.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.770 align:middle line:84%
It was known since
biblical times.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists spoke
in very great detail

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
about how to quiet your
mind, look into the future,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and if you're an
accomplished meditator,

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
you were expected to be able
to see into the distance,

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
see into the future, heal the
sick, and diagnose illnesses.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And various times during
the next millennia,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
people would discover
that, yes, indeed, you

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.970 align:middle line:90%
can look into the future.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.040 align:middle line:90%
You can look into the distance.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And our operation
from 1972 to 1995,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
23 years, our venture into
this was a rediscovery,

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
a recapitulation of what
people had known and forgotten

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:09.640 align:middle line:90%
during the previous millennia.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Religious traditions and the
emerging scientific paradigm

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
are converging on this personal
experience of universal

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:18.730 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer first
glimpsed this reality

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
during a near-death experience
when he was only 17 years old.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've died, and you
know there is no death,

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
then you have no fear of it.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And until you have no fear of
death, you really can't live.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the
consciousness whereby

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I was awake, that drop of
my individual awareness,

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
could merge with the ocean
of unbounded cosmic mind.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So that experience
taught me that there's

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.030 align:middle line:90%
nothing to be afraid of.

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's nowhere to go,
because you're already there.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
You just have to open to what's
already there within you.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
This liberated me in a way
that I can't even imagine.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.300 align:middle line:90%
It is true liberation.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you don't have to drop dead
like I did to have that happen.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you can experience
that through this deeper

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.710 align:middle line:90%
experience in meditation.

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, after I had
that near-death experience,

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I sought out, how do
I get back to there

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
without being deathly ill?

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to learn
how to do meditation,

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
universe is actually

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
folded within every
single conscious being.

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like a quantum hologram.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:28.330 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at it,
every single sentient being

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:32.200 align:middle line:10%
in the cosmos has folded
within the structure

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.710 align:middle line:10%
of their consciousness the
entirety of the cosmos.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is why, within these
deep quiet meditative states,

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
you can obtain knowledge,
see places, know things,

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
communicate.

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in reality,
it's always there.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
You just have to get into a
quiet state of consciousness

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.370 align:middle line:90%
where it opens to.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> "Dost thou reckon thyself
only a puny form when within

01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:00.270 align:middle line:90%
thee, the universe is folded?

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Baha'i teachings.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%


01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I began to be a
student of the ancient Vedas.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
What I learned was that
they had a really excellent

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
articulation, explanation,
of consciousness,

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
the science of consciousness,
higher states of consciousness,

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and their effect.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, their effect are known
as siddhis, S-I-D-D-H-I-S.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
ability to levitate,

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
teleport, dematerialize,
rematerialize, bilocate,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
trilocate, go through
solid objects.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
These were all things
that develop spontaneously

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
as you enter into deeper
and deeper and higher

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:46.580 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Precognition.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And these were not
considered exotic phenomena.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
These were considered
abilities that

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
were available to the
experienced meditators

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
as part of quieting your
mind, part of the practice.

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's all available.

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to participate in
consciously evolving these

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
faculties that we have that can
directly experience dimensions

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
of reality that at the present
time are out beyond our direct,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.132 align:middle line:90%
immediate sensorial system.

01:04:21.132 --> 01:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're engaged in.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.785 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is all about.

01:04:23.785 --> 01:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
these beings are.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
These beings obviously--
they probably

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
come from, like, a red
dwarf star, some of them,

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
where they've been around 10
billion years longer than we

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.680 align:middle line:90%
have.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So they've evolved these
other faculties in addition

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to being able to see and
touch and taste and do

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
the things they do, you know?

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so people are saying,
what is our relationship

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to these beings?

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:47.630 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that they even look
as much as they do like us?

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Or why we look like them?

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.380 align:middle line:10%
These are all profoundly
important questions

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.560 align:middle line:10%
of our relationship
with other sentient

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.410 align:middle line:10%
life in the universe and
to understand our place

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:58.880 align:middle line:10%
in the order of things.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> When you accept what
the science is showing us,

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that we are all connected,
and you then say, well,

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.140 align:middle line:90%
hold on a second.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
If we're not just connected
with human beings,

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
well, we're also connected
with the plant life,

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.330 align:middle line:84%
with the planet itself, with
the entire animal kingdom.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to develop
that deeper sense of empathy

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.170 align:middle line:90%
with all that.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that that
interconnectedness doesn't

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
extend to all the other
planets and to the cosmos?

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
If we share that with
extraterrestrials,

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
what does that world look like?

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If consciousness and
thought can affect something

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
at a distance, and at
a very great distance,

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
even many miles or thousands
of miles away, instantaneously,

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean for
us communicating with

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
a civilization that is
centered in the science

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.130 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is their
chief operating system.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not electromagnetic.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
They use it, but
it's beyond that.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So now, add to everything
we know about the internet

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and communications and telecom.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And then add a deeper level
of transdimensional physics

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that involve electronic
devices very clearly picking up

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:07.387 align:middle line:90%
intended coherent thought.

01:06:07.387 --> 01:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're dealing with.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like Dr. Jahn's
random number generator

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
experiment on a cosmic scale.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But at a level of
perfection where

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
there's precision with the
thought that you project to it,

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
it's reception, and
then its activity.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.760 align:middle line:10%
Interstellar
civilizations are using

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.810 align:middle line:10%
consciousness-assisting
technologies, and technologies

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.420 align:middle line:10%
that assist their own
consciousness both,

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.570 align:middle line:10%
in all their travel and
communication systems.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The central operating system
for any interstellar competent

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
civilization is the
science of consciousness

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and all the physics
that go with that.

>> We can see an early example
of consciousness technology

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Mind Lamp
developed by Psyleron.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
This prototype integrates
a random number generator

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.410 align:middle line:90%
into a color changing light.

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Think of a color, and the
lamp turns that color.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%


01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's what I
actually was doing.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.080 align:middle line:90%
First I was doing sunset.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> This basic interface
between mind and machine points

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to a deep interconnection
between all things that science

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.680 align:middle line:90%
is only beginning to recognize.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.480 align:middle line:90%
It's

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The means for us as a
civilization to be anchored

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
in something more profound
than the superficial aspects

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
of being, say, human.

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Because humanism isn't
enough, because we're dealing

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.410 align:middle line:90%
with non-human life forms.

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to
transcend even humanism

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and our common
humanity into this idea

01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
that there has to be something
more universal within us that's

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.940 align:middle line:84%
also within these
extraterrestrial civilizations

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that bind us together.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And luckily, there is.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's this field of consciousness
that is cosmic and universal.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
inside everyone.

01:07:57.570 --> 01:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it's a
homeless person on the street,

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.880 align:middle line:90%
or an MIT professor.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
If they are conscious and awake,
the entirety of the cosmos

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
is folded within them like a
conscious quantum hologram,

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because consciousness isn't
limited by space and time.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
where do I have to go?

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.939 align:middle line:84%
Well, first you have
to go within yourself.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
what your self is.

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's your
individual ego and self,

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
but there's this deeper
aspect of ourselves that

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%
is simultaneously interwoven.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we go deep in
meditation and connect to that,

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.060 align:middle line:84%
then we have reached
the point that we

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.490 align:middle line:84%
can be an ambassador
to the universe,

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
because we have
become universal.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> "In our time, this search
for extraterrestrial life will

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:46.439 align:middle line:84%
eventually change our laws, our
religions, our philosophies,

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
our arts, our recreations,
as well as our sciences.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Space, the mirror, waits for
life to come look for itself

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.009 align:middle line:90%
there."

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Once this question mark is
introduced into your brain,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.370 align:middle line:10%
you start searching out answers.

01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.590 align:middle line:10%
It was like kind of
the Dreyfuss character

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.149 align:middle line:10%
in "Close Encounters".

01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:15.710 align:middle line:10%
You want to know what's
really behind the screen?

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.359 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not
being told this.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.399 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we
do have the ability

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:22.189 align:middle line:84%
to change life for the
better on this planet,

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:24.170 align:middle line:84%
but we're being
suppressed, and we're

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
being stopped from doing it
for a variety of reasons, most

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.300 align:middle line:90%
of which are greed motivated.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So we went out to Oracle,
and sure enough, I mean,

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
we did these protocols.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And we got into meditation,
which is something

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn about more.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, things
started to appear.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:04.990 align:middle line:10%

you sit in quiet consciousness.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to have a
full on samadhi or whatever,

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
but just in quiet consciousness
connect to that aspect

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:15.320 align:middle line:90%
of your mind that is unbounded.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.155 align:middle line:84%
And then intend to
sense, feel, see,

01:11:18.155 --> 01:11:20.600 align:middle line:90%
know where the ET craft is.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
in another galaxy.

01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Connect to those
beings, politely

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
invite them to
come and visit you.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you connect to
the communication systems

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and their consciousness,
which are integrated.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And you show them where you are.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.100 align:middle line:90%
So you kind of zoom in.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
a vectoring, a zooming

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
in from wherever they
are to where you are.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if you're
in North Carolina,

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%
you're coming in to Earth.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You're coming in to North
America, the East Coast,

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
the mountains, the Blue Ridge.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Zoom, down to a
few square meters

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
around where you are
where you clearly

01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
show them where you are.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.550 align:middle line:10%
And you do this in
a coherent thought

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:04.700 align:middle line:10%
sequence that is continuous.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.660 align:middle line:10%

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:06.620 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.580 align:middle line:10%

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my gosh.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.380 align:middle line:10%

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very easy to do once
you practice it for a while.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The key thing is to first take
about half an hour to meditate.

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Go into quiet mind, then
sense where they are,

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and then invite them.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:28.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, people say, oh,
you're calling them.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.070 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, no,
it's not like that.

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:32.710 align:middle line:10%
You're actually making
contact in consciousness

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:35.920 align:middle line:10%
and thought before they
arrive in their craft

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.260 align:middle line:10%
or transdimensionally
around you.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.770 align:middle line:10%
And when the ETs approach
us most profoundly

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:44.920 align:middle line:10%
is when everyone in the
team is in a coherent state

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.660 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness and are clearly
doing this with the intent.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:52.270 align:middle line:10%
>> This cohesion with a group,
this meditation being part

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:55.510 align:middle line:10%
of making contact,
which I had no idea.

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm looking
at your YouTube videos,

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that component didn't resonate.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It was-- my scientific
brain said, well,

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go look at UFOs.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.250 align:middle line:10%
What happens in these groups
is a coherence between,

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.630 align:middle line:10%
a bond between the group.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And when there's a love
and a connection there,

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:12.972 align:middle line:10%
it enhances the part
of making contact,

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:13.930 align:middle line:10%
because we're together.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:14.730 align:middle line:10%
We're one.

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.860 align:middle line:10%
There's, like, a fine love
there between all of us.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The second or third night
we had the twin ships

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.420 align:middle line:90%
come from the Atlantic Ocean.

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.840 align:middle line:84%
9:00, 10:00 at night, here's all
of a sudden this ship comes in

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's, like,
the size of a sun.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's pulsing.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Greer, you signal
it with your laser.

01:13:32.530 --> 01:13:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And then a second one manifests.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're both pulsing.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
At that point, my
hair is standing up.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I have the chills.

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, this is amazing.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- to actually
witness something

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
firsthand as opposed to
seeing in television,

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
or seeing photographs,
it's mind blowing.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.200 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was so
profound, I was--

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep that night.

01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I was just amazed.

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But the amazement was
not that I saw it.

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I needed that,
because I have that mindset.

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
But the feeling you got.

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I got this incredible feeling.

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
these two ships,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and then, I can't explain it.

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just an emotional state.

01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was so taken by it.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you see something
you can't unsee it.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.770 align:middle line:10%
It sort of shattered my
small view of the world.

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And I became aware.

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Learning the protocols and
making this kind of contact has

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.800 align:middle line:10%
really helped me move
up a notch, spiritually.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that it's
helped me to really see

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:34.150 align:middle line:90%
the oneness in all things.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
When you're sitting
under a blanket of stars,

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.720 align:middle line:90%
you're really part of it.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:43.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's you feel your
little drop in that huge ocean.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, it's emotional.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to experience it,
but I wish for everybody

01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:50.980 align:middle line:90%
to have that opportunity.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> "Mind is a wave of
the ocean of being."

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:02.360 align:middle line:10%
>> When I first started
out, it was shocking.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.870 align:middle line:10%
The first few orbs I
saw, the phenomena I saw

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:middle line:10%
changed my entire paradigm.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The first sighting was an
incredible triangle formation

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of three golden spears
over my apartment

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.980 align:middle line:90%
in Newport Beach, California.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I ran outside and saw this
formation right above my house

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:19.600 align:middle line:90%
at close range.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to
capture it on film.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
As I put the lens
on it, I saw they

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
were three perfect
golden spears, all

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
holding this incredible
formation over my apartment.

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.880 align:middle line:84%
The longer I filmed, the more
maneuvers they demonstrated.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear the objects
were under intelligent control.

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%


01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
It was Christmas
morning, December 2016.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I was on my porch
having coffee when

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I saw this incredible
double-staged orb flying

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:49.960 align:middle line:90%
through the air.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.097 align:middle line:84%
I was following
this object upward,

01:15:52.097 --> 01:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and it went right
up like it was going

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to pass out of my line of
sight when I asked the object,

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
please, turn back around.

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want the
experience to end.

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, it stopped,
changed direction, then

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.780 align:middle line:90%
headed back downward.

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
That was truly profound to
me that I could meditate,

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:09.670 align:middle line:84%
send my thought
into the universe,

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and then have a visual
response in the sky

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
to confirm that we are
interacting with each other.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.070 align:middle line:10%
That says something
about the nature of mind,

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:20.530 align:middle line:10%
the nature of the
phenomenon itself,

01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:23.200 align:middle line:10%
and the power of our own
consciousness to interact.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.660 align:middle line:90%


01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
In October 2018, we had
the biggest sighting

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I've seen yet in Long
Beach, California.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend and I
were in the backyard

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
when we saw this huge
white object in the sky.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
This was different than most
of the normal orbs I film.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
This object was elongated
and almost looked

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:44.330 align:middle line:90%
like a moving portal in the sky.

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, once I
got the camera on it,

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
an incredible triangle
formation of orbs

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
shot out of this main object,
and I captured it on film.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
You can hear how excited I am
in the film to see this again,

01:16:56.510 --> 01:17:00.470 align:middle line:84%
this triangle formation
for the third time.

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:04.215 align:middle line:90%
What the fuck is that thing?

01:17:04.215 --> 01:17:05.015 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:17:05.015 --> 01:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Holy shit.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:12.230 align:middle line:90%


01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I continued to film the
object as it traversed

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
across the sky, when
suddenly it started

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
ejecting a series of these
smaller orbs, 50 smaller

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:22.910 align:middle line:90%
objects and counting.

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Strangely, I could only
see the smaller orbs

01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
on my infrared camera.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
They were not visible
to the naked eye.

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes to show you how much
is flying around in the sky

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see.

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> About six months after I had
the near-death experience and I

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:46.720 align:middle line:84%
began learning meditation, I
was sitting up on a mountain up

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.950 align:middle line:90%
in North Carolina.

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And right before
sunset, I looked over

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
towards the southwest, and
I saw a beautiful silver

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.360 align:middle line:90%
disk, seamless.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Close encounter
of the first kind.

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It looked exactly
like the ET craft

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen when I was
eight or nine when

01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I was a child in North
Carolina, which actually ignited

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.350 align:middle line:90%
my interest in all of this.

01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.943 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh,
well, they're back.

01:18:07.943 --> 01:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
much more about it.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.430 align:middle line:90%
So I sat to meditate.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this
very deep meditation.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
By the time I came
out of the meditation,

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
it was very pitch dark, and
there was the whole Milky Way

01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:19.750 align:middle line:90%
galaxy was above my head.

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
And a thought was sent into me.

01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It was very clear.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't my random thought
or a hallucination at all.

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And it said behold what
a beautiful universe

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%
God has made.

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.878 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I went right
into the state of consciousness

01:18:34.878 --> 01:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that I was in in the
near-death experience,

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
except now I'm awake and
standing on the mountain.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And at that instant,
I became aware

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that there was sort of
a glow, an energy field

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
right below the peak
and through the forest.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a deer
standing on its hind legs.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And it had these
beautiful deer-like eyes.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And I went, what
is that doing here?

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And I realized it wasn't a deer.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And it actually appeared and
then dematerialized, came over

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:06.025 align:middle line:84%
and touched me on
the right shoulder.

01:19:06.025 --> 01:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But I could sense its energy
field was still there.

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It was phasing in and out
of 3D and the near dimension

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%
of astral energy.

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And when it touched
my right shoulder,

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:20.995 align:middle line:84%
I could actually see
my ski jacket indent.

01:19:20.995 --> 01:19:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And all my hair stood on end.

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
electromagnetic pulse.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had long hair,
and it sort of, ding.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
At that instant, I vanished off
the mountaintop onto the ship.

01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we were, bang,
almost instantly out in space.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I stayed
in this meditative state

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and was teaching
the ETs what it was

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
like to be in that
state of consciousness

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
but also be a boy, a
young man, on Earth.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They were very
interested in this.

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind of merged
together in our meditation,

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and I created with
them this protocol

01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:00.410 align:middle line:90%
for making contact with them.

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Two years later, Dr.
Greer attempted to recreate

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
the experience during a
meditation teacher training

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
course in the French Alps,
resulting in the first mass

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
witness CE-5.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> What we experienced in
France was really life-changing

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:17.390 align:middle line:90%
for me.

01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:20.000 align:middle line:10%
It was the summer
of 1975, and that

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
was the year we both turned 20.

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
When we were in
teacher training,

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
it was very intensive.

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You were meditating,
doing yoga, listening

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:30.740 align:middle line:90%
to endless tapes of Maharishi.

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:34.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So I did a deep meditation,
went into this state,

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and could sense where in
space these ET craft were,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.540 align:middle line:10%
connected to them,
introduced myself by name,

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:45.080 align:middle line:10%
and then vectored them like
you would vector a jet into JFK

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.600 align:middle line:10%
airport.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> All of a sudden,
right out of nowhere,

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
appeared a metallic silent
tetrahedron-shaped silver ship.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It just appeared.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is that, Steve?

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.680 align:middle line:90%
There was no sound.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was just suspended
in the air and then gone.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was just
the blue sky again.

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It will happen if you do
it with just a pure state

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
of innocence about it.

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
that this can actually

01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
be done with groups of people.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And I just filed that away.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.880 align:middle line:90%


01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Snoopy 2, if you would, turn
toward the tower and show me

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.904 align:middle line:10%
your lights so I can look
over that way with glasses.

01:21:31.904 --> 01:21:33.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Snoopy 2, roger.

01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:37.280 align:middle line:10%
We got, uh, I don't know
where they got to now.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.203 align:middle line:10%
There was two of them.

01:21:38.203 --> 01:21:40.370 align:middle line:10%
They were low and then they
went to about 4,000 foot

01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:41.831 align:middle line:10%
and started circling.

01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:43.120 align:middle line:10%
There was two of them.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.250 align:middle line:10%
No navigation lights
at all on them.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1977, Dr. Greer discovered
how precisely he could vector

01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
ETs to a specific location.

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:55.850 align:middle line:10%
Upon reconnecting
with those beings,

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
using the CE-5
protocols, he showed

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:01.310 align:middle line:10%
them his location in the
Blue Ridge mountains,

01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:05.180 align:middle line:10%
but first directed them to
where he was born and raised

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.400 align:middle line:10%
in Charlotte, North Carolina.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Then he went to sleep.

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:12.010 align:middle line:90%


01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Two objects
over the Coliseum.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.910 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I do have something.

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:19.090 align:middle line:10%
I got a Cessna out
there eastbound.

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:20.770 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
the other one is.

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:21.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Negative.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.462 align:middle line:10%
You've got two of 'em out here.

01:22:22.462 --> 01:22:25.270 align:middle line:10%
They keep circling.

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:29.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Unbeknownst to him, that
attempt to initiate contact

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.760 align:middle line:10%
precipitated a major sighting
over Charlotte involving pilots

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.470 align:middle line:10%
and air traffic control.

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:39.400 align:middle line:10%
An insider has leaked the FAA
traffic control tapes that

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.667 align:middle line:10%
corroborated the encounter.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:43.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Snoopy 2, you know something?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm not seeing the
target right now.

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Negative, Roger.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.590 align:middle line:10%
We've got something
out here flying around.

01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:51.010 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe in saucers,
but it ain't an aircraft.

01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what it is.

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What I experienced
was that I'm awakened,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's this kind of
beautiful cobalt blue ship,

01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe 20 feet above the
ground outside my window,

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
the bedroom window.

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
This wakes up my housemate,
who's in the bedroom

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
adjacent to mine.

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.930 align:middle line:10%
He comes running out and
says, what did you do?

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:17.480 align:middle line:10%
And the lesson from that was
the specificity of the vector.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
was very specific.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I vectored them
first to Charlotte,

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.840 align:middle line:90%
showed them where Charlotte was.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The epicenter of where
all this was going on

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
was over the part of Charlotte
where I was born and all that.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:29.805 align:middle line:84%
And then guided them
from there up here.

01:23:29.805 --> 01:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
they were saying

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to me is we can be very
specific with instructions,

01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and we'll show you that.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It was a teachable moment.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of felt like I really
shouldn't do this unless I

01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
have some higher purpose to.

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:45.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Sounds like a
close encounter.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Snoopy 2, Roger.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:52.050 align:middle line:90%


01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:55.410 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1990, he formed
the Center for the Study

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:59.610 align:middle line:10%
of Extraterrestrial Intelligence
to disseminate the CE-5

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:04.590 align:middle line:10%
protocols and establish peaceful
and sustainable relations with

01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:07.620 align:middle line:10%
ET life forms.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Two years later, Dr.
Greer and his team

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
went up to Woodborough
hill in Wiltshire, England.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:15.330 align:middle line:84%
There, they
visualized and thought

01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
a geometric pattern symbolizing
the trilogy of components

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that make up the CE-5 protocols;
thought, light, and sound.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, this crop circle
appeared in the field nearby.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:45.570 align:middle line:90%


01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:47.310 align:middle line:10%
>> So some of these
civilizations that

01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:50.970 align:middle line:10%
we're interacting with on
our teams are in the order

01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:53.790 align:middle line:10%
of a billion years
beyond our development.

01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:56.970 align:middle line:10%
And all those beings
in that civilization

01:24:56.970 --> 01:24:59.790 align:middle line:10%
are in a state of
unity consciousness

01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:02.100 align:middle line:10%
that is so enlightened
that they could

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.660 align:middle line:10%
be confused with, say,
an angel or something.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.460 align:middle line:10%
But they're not.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:09.360 align:middle line:10%
They're not from-- they're ETs
with star systems and planets

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.850 align:middle line:10%
and bodies, but their
level of consciousness

01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:15.760 align:middle line:10%
would be at the level of, say,
the highest spiritual realm.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.850 align:middle line:10%
There's a precise correlation
to the kind of technology

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:23.460 align:middle line:10%
that you will observe and
the level of consciousness

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.130 align:middle line:10%
that civilization has attained.

01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's take our own civilization.

01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
We're mostly still
separate people,

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and we are operating through a
reductionist separate paradigm.

01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:35.580 align:middle line:10%
We're also still very
violent and destructive.

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
our technologies.

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Oil, we're burning something
and destroying the air.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.140 align:middle line:10%
Nuclear power, we're
splitting and tearing apart

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:48.120 align:middle line:10%
an atom to create heat to turn
a turbine to create electricity.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Coal, we're digging stuff
up and destroying mountains

01:25:51.090 --> 01:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and then burning this
stuff in a fiery furnace.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's all very destructive.

01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And so our technologies are a
corollary to our inner state

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:02.640 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1964, Soviet astronomer
Nikolai Kardashev proposed

01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:09.870 align:middle line:10%
a hypothetical
scale of measuring

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:13.680 align:middle line:10%
a civilization's level of
technological advancement based

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.220 align:middle line:10%
on the amount of energy
they're able to utilize.

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
A level I civilization,
also called

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:24.070 align:middle line:84%
a planetary civilization,
can use and store

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.620 align:middle line:84%
all the energy
available on its planet.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> At that point, their main
focus becomes the development

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
of higher states
of consciousness.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.620 align:middle line:10%
Because they have all the
technologies to meet everyone's

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.380 align:middle line:10%
needs, there's no shortage.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.800 align:middle line:10%
Their economic system is
non-economic in the sense

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.590 align:middle line:10%
that there is infinite
abundance for everyone,

01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:47.890 align:middle line:10%
because of these technologies
that can materialize things out

01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:53.750 align:middle line:10%
of the substrate of spacetime,
the elementals of spacetime.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:58.180 align:middle line:10%
So at that point, a civilization
becomes really focused

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.580 align:middle line:10%
on the development of higher
states of consciousness.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And as they evolve
in consciousness,

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.830 align:middle line:84%
their technologies
evolve with them.

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They will begin to then unfurl
the mysteries of consciousness

01:27:11.410 --> 01:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and the siddhis I mentioned
earlier in the Vedas.

01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But those get applied
technologically,

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
which include levitation,
teleportation,

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.960 align:middle line:84%
dematerialization, bilocation,
where the same object can

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.710 align:middle line:84%
be instantly resonantly created
and be in two places at once.

01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
We've had this
happen on our team.

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> "As water by cooling and
condensation becomes ice,

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
so thought by condensation
assumes physical form.

01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe
is thought in material form."

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Paramahansa Yogananda.

01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:48.640 align:middle line:90%


01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I like this story of this
Lockheed Skunk Works top secret

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.340 align:middle line:90%
witness who defected.

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to learn a
technique to go into meditation

01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.390 align:middle line:90%
but then astrally project.

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And he went up out of his body
with his astral body of light,

01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
went up into the air,
and slammed right

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.625 align:middle line:84%
into the side of
an ET spacecraft.

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, what he
couldn't understand

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
was that when he bumped
up against the ET

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.930 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft with his astral
body, the body all of you--

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
when you have a lucid dream, and
you're flying over the water,

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.860 align:middle line:90%
or flying over--

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.330 align:middle line:90%
that is your body of light.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The same thing when you have
a near-death experience.

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.240 align:middle line:90%
You go in your body of light.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, his astral body hit
the side of this craft.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And it rocked it.

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And then he popped inside.

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.365 align:middle line:84%
The ETs were looking
at him like, my god.

01:28:33.365 --> 01:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Cosmic faux pas.

01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:37.870 align:middle line:90%
But he moved the ship.

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
He says, how did my astral
body move that ET spacecraft?

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, because the density of
that spacecraft, resonantly,

01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
energetically, was identical
to your astral body.

01:28:47.710 --> 01:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Because with the naked eye,
it was shifted out of 3D

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
into this dimension that is
increasingly conscious energy

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.460 align:middle line:90%
and conscious forms.

01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And since like can
interface with like,

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
your density of your
astral body and that craft,

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was
shifted to that level,

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%
it could interact with it.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, had it been a 3D craft
that had stepped down,

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
like a Transformer,
stepped down into full 3D,

01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
he would have gone
straight through it.

01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:19.027 align:middle line:84%
Because the density would
have been different.

01:29:19.027 --> 01:29:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The resonant field interface
would have been different.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I explained
that to him, he said,

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:27.430 align:middle line:84%
now I understand so
many things that have

01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:29.800 align:middle line:90%
happened between me and ETs.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The great thing about CE-5
is it's anything but remote.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.316 align:middle line:90%
It is true contact.

01:29:36.316 --> 01:29:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Steve, look.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:41.196 align:middle line:90%
>> That was great.

01:29:41.196 --> 01:29:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a shooting star.

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> During a CE-5 expedition
at Mount Shasta, Dr.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Greer and his team were in
contact with an interstellar

01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:56.500 align:middle line:84%
object and its occupants in
the field in front of them.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, this light ship
lifted off from the ground

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and turned left, phasing
in and out of 3D space

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
time before vanishing
in clear skies.

01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:13.816 align:middle line:84%
This was visible to the naked
eye for everyone present.

01:30:13.816 --> 01:30:16.790 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, Dr. Greer says our
first interest is an academic

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:17.590 align:middle line:10%
interest.

01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:21.460 align:middle line:10%
And in my case, that
was how I got into this.

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:27.500 align:middle line:10%
But very quickly after that,
it changes to a heart, mind,

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:33.140 align:middle line:10%
and soul connection that is
really a very powerful driving

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.740 align:middle line:10%
force in your life.

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's important to go
from the academic interest

01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:40.910 align:middle line:10%
to the experience level.

01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happens very quickly.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You make this transition
to an experience

01:30:45.710 --> 01:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of this new lifestyle,
this new understanding

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of our place in the universe.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to take
action, because it's

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
important to not only learn
about this academically,

01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.910 align:middle line:90%
but then to take action on it.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:01.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It was very
empowering for me,

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:04.760 align:middle line:10%
because I felt like they helped
to let us know that we are

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.400 align:middle line:10%
on the right path, and that
we have the power to make

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.420 align:middle line:10%
a change.

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:10.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It changes you completely.

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.530 align:middle line:10%
It changes your heart.

01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:16.040 align:middle line:10%
And then your
entire life changes.

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
All things from that point
forward are possible.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.930 align:middle line:90%


01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a friend in Holland.

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Her name's Linda.

01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And she has some very amazing
footage that she's captured.

01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, I came from
Hessdalen, that's Norway,

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
where you have a lot
of activity there.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go to bed, and
something said, no, you

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:40.080 align:middle line:90%
have to go outside.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting my
camera up, and then I

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.215 align:middle line:84%
said, OK, if you're there,
can you just fly by and stop?

01:31:46.215 --> 01:31:49.980 align:middle line:10%
So a craft came at very fast
speed, and bloop, stopped.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.000 align:middle line:10%
And then, OK, and flew away.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:52.995 align:middle line:90%
>> This is amazing.

01:31:52.995 --> 01:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
It'll stop, turn left,
turn right, move around

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.770 align:middle line:90%
at all kinds of angles.

01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And she's had multiple
events like this happen.

01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What will be evident in
that footage is what she has

01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:07.350 align:middle line:90%
actually asked for them to do.

01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's
one case where she

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
has told me herself that
they have produced a V shape.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And she requested
that in consciousness.

01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So I looked up, and suddenly
something appeared in front

01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:20.130 align:middle line:90%
of me.

01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, are you there?

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.940 align:middle line:10%
And then they come out.

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:28.230 align:middle line:10%
They've divided theirselves in
six balls and then three balls.

01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:31.290 align:middle line:10%
And there were lots
of other lights.

01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>> We see this quite often,
but it's very unusual to get it

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:35.310 align:middle line:10%
on video.

01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:38.070 align:middle line:10%
And this is why it's
a fantastic example

01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:42.270 align:middle line:10%
of the kind of maneuverability
that these spacecraft can make.

01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I really do love it when
people get things like that,

01:32:45.090 --> 01:32:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and they can show people
that are new to the subject,

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.695 align:middle line:90%
because it's really inspiring.

01:32:49.695 --> 01:32:51.982 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:32:51.982 --> 01:33:18.604 align:middle line:90%


01:33:18.604 --> 01:33:26.326 align:middle line:84%
It's late and I'm awake
staring at the wall.

01:33:26.326 --> 01:33:33.811 align:middle line:84%
Open up my window, head
floats out the door.

01:33:33.811 --> 01:33:42.494 align:middle line:84%
No one else around, but
a shimmer takes my eye.

01:33:42.494 --> 01:33:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I lift my head,
blinded by the sky.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Feel my way in front,
following the sound.

01:33:56.590 --> 01:34:01.325 align:middle line:90%
It moves away so fast.

01:34:01.325 --> 01:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Fall into the ground.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:11.844 align:middle line:10%
I know it wants to come,
jump back to my feet.

01:34:11.844 --> 01:34:19.083 align:middle line:10%
Now I only see ahead of me
chasing down the street.

01:34:19.083 --> 01:34:21.055 align:middle line:90%
Down the street.

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:23.027 align:middle line:90%
Down the street.

01:34:23.027 --> 01:34:24.506 align:middle line:90%
Down the street.

01:34:24.506 --> 01:34:39.303 align:middle line:90%


01:34:39.303 --> 01:34:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I do want to know--

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a first
for everything.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What do aliens look like?

01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well,
the one, for example,

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that healed this man's
hearing who is in our circle,

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.990 align:middle line:84%
sort of very triangular head,
about 5 and 1/2 feet tall.

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The photograph of
it is beautiful,

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.637 align:middle line:84%
but the experience that this
man had was more beautiful.

01:34:59.637 --> 01:35:02.559 align:middle line:90%


01:35:02.559 --> 01:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a great experience
at Oracle and ended up having

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:09.320 align:middle line:90%
a healing experience.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We did these protocols,
and we got into meditation.

01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:14.420 align:middle line:90%
And things started to appear.

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're photographing
it, and we're seeing it,

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.418 align:middle line:84%
and we're watching it
and we're looking around.

01:35:18.418 --> 01:35:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's
mouths are wide open.

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, these craft,
they pop in and out so fast

01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that to try and capture
them on a telephoto lens

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
is next to impossible.

01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> While in deep meditation,
they heard a being walking

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.870 align:middle line:84%
behind them, phasing in
and out of 3D space time.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Marconi adjusts his camera
to shoot in the direction

01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:42.490 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Greer pointed.

01:35:42.490 --> 01:35:44.590 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden,
a teardrop-shaped

01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:47.530 align:middle line:10%
transdimensional
object materialized

01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:50.590 align:middle line:10%
between Ed Moen and a medical
student, which was witnessed

01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:53.050 align:middle line:10%
by most of the circle.

01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:56.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We reviewed my photos
from that particular time,

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and there on the hillside,
standing behind a man named Ed

01:35:59.110 --> 01:36:03.730 align:middle line:10%
Moen, was this being that
everyone was like, whoa,

01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:05.656 align:middle line:10%
what is this.

01:36:05.656 --> 01:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This being has a
very triangular face,

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and has been seen on a
number of our expeditions.

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And they are known
as master healers.

01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Ed couldn't-- he wore
hearing aids in both ears and he

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
couldn't hear half the things
people were saying to him.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I had hearing loss
from high school.

01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:25.540 align:middle line:10%
I would avoid parties and social
settings where lots of people

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:28.090 align:middle line:10%
would gather together, because
it was uncomfortable not

01:36:28.090 --> 01:36:28.890 align:middle line:10%
to be able to hear.

01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:31.700 align:middle line:90%


01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I got to my room, and I felt
this draw to go back out there.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So I got up and walked out.

01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this red light out
in the middle of the desert,

01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:43.030 align:middle line:90%
about 300 feet away or so.

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I connected with it right away.

01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was aware of
me, and that it was indeed

01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:50.080 align:middle line:90%
the thing that was calling me.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So I invited it to
come and hang out.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
At one point, Daniel heard
me talking to this red orb,

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't
believe it either.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
He went and got his camera
and took a short video

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:05.900 align:middle line:90%
clip of this red orb.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> He said that for
the next 45 minutes,

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
he had a communication
with them.

01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the conversation,

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.602 align:middle line:84%
he said, do you think you can
do something about my hearing?

01:37:17.602 --> 01:37:20.302 align:middle line:84%
>> I got some sleep,
and when I woke up,

01:37:20.302 --> 01:37:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I went out to breakfast
with some of the people

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.380 align:middle line:90%
in the group.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I had hearing aids, and they
weren't with me at breakfast.

01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
emotional event for me

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to discover that I could
hear everything everyone was

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.400 align:middle line:90%
saying at the table.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And not only at my table,
but at tables away from me.

01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't worn my
hearing aids since.

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time finding
them to bring them here.

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:48.710 align:middle line:84%
They do a very good job, but
not as good as the ETs did.

01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's changed my life.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, it really has.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.717 align:middle line:90%
That's the part that gets me.

01:37:55.717 --> 01:37:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't know this happened
to him until I saw him the next

01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.800 align:middle line:90%
day on the hammock.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was just
relating this story.

01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And he was crying like a baby.

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And just to watch the
emotion coming out of him

01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:09.130 align:middle line:90%
was very moving.

01:38:09.130 --> 01:38:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's had perfect
hearing since then.

01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> My takeaway from the event
and from my experience with

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:19.570 align:middle line:84%
the ETs is that they've
been in my life a long time.

01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:21.520 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know it.

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's such a beautiful
world waiting for us.

01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:27.670 align:middle line:90%


01:38:27.670 --> 01:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It's useful for us to think
about our own experience over

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:31.650 align:middle line:90%
the last couple hundred years.

01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
If you go back
200 and some years

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and show Thomas Jefferson
a modern smartphone,

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to anyone of that
period, it would look

01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:41.300 align:middle line:90%
like something that was magic.

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> "Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.090 align:middle line:90%
from magic."

01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Arthur C. Clarke.

01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.320 align:middle line:10%
>> We're dealing with
civilizations where almost

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:55.820 align:middle line:10%
every aspect of how they appear
in our time space would look

01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:57.050 align:middle line:10%
like magic to us.

01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And in the CIA, this is
actually called WSFM.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.690 align:middle line:10%
It sounds like a radio station.

01:39:02.690 --> 01:39:05.780 align:middle line:10%
It stands for Weird
Science and Frickin' Magic.

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:08.660 align:middle line:10%
A spacecraft can
be completely 3D

01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.300 align:middle line:10%
like you see a solid aircraft.

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It can be partially
in this dimension,

01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:17.195 align:middle line:84%
but shifted mostly
into another dimension.

01:39:17.195 --> 01:39:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So I liken this to,
like, when you're turning

01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:21.800 align:middle line:90%
a dial on an old AM radio.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can move it
across, and you suddenly

01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
pick up Chicago and New
York at the same time.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They're bleeding together,
dimensional bleeding.

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:33.920 align:middle line:10%
And so often, these ET
craft will be partially

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.800 align:middle line:10%
in this dimension,
but mostly out.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And all that we will
detect in this dimension

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.320 align:middle line:10%
might be an electronic
signature or an object that

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.220 align:middle line:10%
appears and flashes in and out,
a scintillation of light that

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:51.350 align:middle line:10%
then vanishes, or an object that
comes in where it looks almost

01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:54.080 align:middle line:10%
like a hologram of
an ET being that

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.210 align:middle line:10%
will be standing
amongst us, but it's

01:39:56.210 --> 01:39:59.180 align:middle line:10%
an electronically
teleported version

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.250 align:middle line:10%
of that conscious being.

01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:02.300 align:middle line:90%
I love this one.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.887 align:middle line:90%
His name is Bijou.

01:40:03.887 --> 01:40:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's pronounced "Bee-joo".

01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:08.180 align:middle line:10%
He's an interstellar
beam from Andromeda.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.950 align:middle line:10%
And he has a very
bright-looking nose,

01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:14.480 align:middle line:10%
because there is a orb here that
teleported him onto the site.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
With the naked eye, the
only thing that was seen

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
was this sphere that came
up right beside my shoulder.

01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>> What was amazing is there
was a light kind of illuminating

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.020 align:middle line:10%
this being.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.410 align:middle line:10%
He was just floating in sort
of this energetic space,

01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:29.393 align:middle line:10%
and it looked like
he was waving at me.

01:40:29.393 --> 01:40:30.935 align:middle line:10%
>> He's sort of
doing this, floating.

01:40:30.935 --> 01:40:33.080 align:middle line:10%
He's in the air
maybe five feet up.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.810 align:middle line:10%
When I asked him
where he was from,

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:38.750 align:middle line:10%
he said he was from
Andromeda galaxy.

01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes I have to pinch
myself and make sure I do

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:45.620 align:middle line:84%
a little self-check to make
sure I'm just really seeing

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:47.450 align:middle line:84%
something, or it's
not my imagination.

01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:52.070 align:middle line:10%
But that was a huge
confirmation that we are really

01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:54.110 align:middle line:10%
on to something with
what we're doing,

01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:56.060 align:middle line:10%
that we are really
making contact.

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:59.420 align:middle line:10%
The ETs are participants
in the whole story,

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.190 align:middle line:10%
in this whole unfoldment.

01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:04.160 align:middle line:10%
So it's really amazing
that you're communicating

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.730 align:middle line:10%
with someone from an
entirely different world,

01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:12.200 align:middle line:10%
and it's mind-boggling, really.

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, this is beautiful.

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.490 align:middle line:10%
We were on the beach and this
appears right on the sand

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:17.930 align:middle line:10%
in front of me.

01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the
eyes very faintly.

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:22.190 align:middle line:10%
It's barely in this dimension.

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:24.881 align:middle line:10%
It's very crystalline.

01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:27.550 align:middle line:10%
It's pitch black on this beach.

01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
This being, highly intelligent,
an extraterrestrial

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:34.510 align:middle line:84%
civilization at the
level of the celestial.

01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So visualize humanity
evolving to the point

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.930 align:middle line:84%
that everyone on Earth were
in cosmic consciousness

01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:42.340 align:middle line:90%
and enlightenment.

01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:44.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Half a million to a
billion years ahead of us.

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Get a load of this.

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.230 align:middle line:84%
We're in a deep
meditation I'm leading.

01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.880 align:middle line:90%
We're in cosmic consciousness.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a Peruvian
doctor, a medical doctor.

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
cosmic spermatozoa.

01:41:56.530 --> 01:42:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It looks-- and it comes in,
and it wraps around her.

01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And she begins to have the
kundalini and an enlightenment

01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:05.650 align:middle line:90%
experience like she's never had.

01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this happens
a lot on these expeditions.

01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:11.020 align:middle line:90%
But we got it on photograph.

01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:13.628 align:middle line:90%
I love this one.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just off the edge of hill.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And you see people
turning to look.

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was this object
that materialized

01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:23.560 align:middle line:84%
into this dimension, and lit
up and then dematerialized.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.790 align:middle line:84%
What I saw in my remote
view was a very large craft

01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
filled with ETs from
different civilizations

01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that were joining us
in the meditation,

01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:33.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
they're interested in.

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.880 align:middle line:84%
They're interested if you have
a pure heart, a clear intent,

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're wanting to join
them in universal peace.

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
about your degrees.

01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about--

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:46.750 align:middle line:84%
this is what the Prince
of Liechtenstein said.

01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:48.583 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've gone all
over the world where

01:42:48.583 --> 01:42:50.860 align:middle line:84%
these UFOs are seen, and
they're seen before I'm there

01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.410 align:middle line:90%
and after.

01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:52.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm there,
they're not around.

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's my attitude.

01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, bingo.

01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:57.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Every experience that
could be-- that was described,

01:42:57.970 --> 01:43:00.550 align:middle line:10%
no matter how
unbelievable, in Dr.

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.200 align:middle line:10%
Greer's books or the manuals,
we've experienced them

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.000 align:middle line:10%
ourselves.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And someone snapped a photo
with their iPad, beams of energy

01:43:08.290 --> 01:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
with arrowheads
on them coming out

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of members' third eye
in the heart center.

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:14.740 align:middle line:10%
When we looked closer
at the photo here,

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.730 align:middle line:10%
there was a silhouette.

01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And they were standing--

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.622 align:middle line:84%
before we had broken
the circle, they

01:43:18.622 --> 01:43:20.485 align:middle line:84%
were standing under
the hands of people

01:43:20.485 --> 01:43:21.610 align:middle line:90%
as we had held hands there.

01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So you could see a bald
being with a long robe,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.420 align:middle line:90%
about four feet tall.

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:27.850 align:middle line:90%
So that was an amazing shot.

01:43:27.850 --> 01:43:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What I began to understand
is that there is this whole

01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:36.130 align:middle line:84%
spectrum of phenomena that
involves 3D matter, light,

01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:40.840 align:middle line:84%
sounds that emerge, tonality,
electromagnetic interface.

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have
electronic devices

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
we'll have out, like
a radar detector,

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:48.190 align:middle line:84%
magnetometers that pick up
the magnetic field shift.

01:43:48.190 --> 01:43:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Those will all start
being activated

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.315 align:middle line:90%
when a craft is approaching.

01:43:52.315 --> 01:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're out in the
middle of the wilderness

01:43:54.190 --> 01:43:57.250 align:middle line:84%
where there's no source of
this electromagnetic radiation.

01:43:57.250 --> 01:44:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But they'll start communicating
in a specific cadence,

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and a repeatable cadence.

01:44:02.890 --> 01:44:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I call this transdimensional
electronic communication.

01:44:06.130 --> 01:44:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And they will actually
take over the circuitry

01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.150 align:middle line:84%
of these electronic devices
we have out in the desert,

01:44:13.150 --> 01:44:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and begin to do a
specific communication.

01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to decode it,
but it's reproducible.

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And their different
civilizations

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:23.840 align:middle line:90%
will have a different pattern.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is an electronic
version of them making contact.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> On the shores of the Outer
Banks in North Carolina,

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.266 align:middle line:84%

or if they feel
apprehensive about doing it,

01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:36.290 align:middle line:90%
make sure you do it in a group.

01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you set up the
parameters of unity, of peace.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a frequency
that is as far

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:46.280 align:middle line:90%
out of the spectrum of fear.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's an
incompatibility there

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.060 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific perspective.

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.480 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
resonant waves, the energy,

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the gratitude, love,
joy, peace, all of that,

01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.120 align:middle line:84%
this is a frequency
that you establish first

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
through whichever
practice appeals to you.

01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And then extend your
connection from there.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have
discovered that remote viewing

01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and meditation are most
effective when the participant

01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:14.780 align:middle line:84%
enters a state called
heart-mind coherence.

01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The human heart
contains 40,000 neurons

01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that can sense, feel,
learn, and remember.

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.060 align:middle line:84%
You can bring your mind and
heart into this coherent state

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and have more
access to intuitive

01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:32.600 align:middle line:84%
knowing by consciously
focusing on positive emotions

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.700 align:middle line:90%
during your meditation.

01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> These beings can--

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.060 align:middle line:90%
they respond to our thoughts.

01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:39.500 align:middle line:90%
They respond to our thoughts.

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So they will not be invasive.

01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you're feeling like
you want to continue whatever

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.270 align:middle line:84%
contact experience
that is happening,

01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:50.250 align:middle line:84%
but there may be a
bit of residual fear

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
work through, tell them.

01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Say, look, I'd love to
carry on doing this,

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.240 align:middle line:84%
but I feel a bit
scared right now.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me with that?

01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And they will.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the other evidence
I know they're not hostile.

01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:06.360 align:middle line:84%
We've been all over
the world, thousands

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.010 align:middle line:84%
of hours with
thousands of people,

01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:13.620 align:middle line:84%
have had all manner of contact
at a distance and intimately--

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.380 align:middle line:84%
beings, ET beings
appearing in our rooms--

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.580 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.990 align:middle line:90%
No one has ever been harmed.

01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:20.520 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever
been harmed at all.

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:24.390 align:middle line:84%
This is in an official
document on the FBI website,

01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:26.070 align:middle line:90%
sort of hidden in plain sight.

01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But it really
confirms everything

01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're explaining, but
also the experience we've had.

01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And this is from 1947.

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:34.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is 72 years old.

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.400 align:middle line:10%
He goes through and describes
that they are peaceful people.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.260 align:middle line:90%
They traverse these dimensions.

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
That they have these
abilities in consciousness.

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.170 align:middle line:84%
He even relates to
some of the Vedic terms

01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:50.100 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of capabilities
witnessed from these beings.

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> "All matter originates
and exists only by virtue

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of a force which brings
the particles of the atom

01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:59.540 align:middle line:90%
to vibration.

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I must assume behind
this force the existence

01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of a conscious and
intelligent mind.

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:09.200 align:middle line:84%
This mind is the
matrix of all matter."

>> Even though what I'm doing
with CE-5 is what I'm most

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.910 align:middle line:84%
ridiculed for, it was the
project that got the most

01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:23.310 align:middle line:84%
respect and attention from
the intelligence community,

01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:25.170 align:middle line:90%
because they knew it was real.

01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They knew the science of
consciousness is real.

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They knew that these
ET civilizations

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
utilize communication
technologies that

01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:35.280 align:middle line:84%
interface with thought, and
telepathy, and consciousness.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.360 align:middle line:90%
They all know this.

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is an open secret in
the intelligence community.

01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:43.650 align:middle line:84%
We all think that power is
derived from your weapons

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:47.050 align:middle line:84%
system, your financial clout,
the usual materialistic

01:48:47.050 --> 01:48:47.850 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

01:48:47.850 --> 01:48:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason that the deeper
elements of the intelligence

01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:52.350 align:middle line:84%
community have this
intense interest in it

01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and don't want the public to
know is that first of all,

01:48:54.930 --> 01:48:58.830 align:middle line:84%
it is extremely
efficient spycraft,

01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.420 align:middle line:84%
which they don't
want others to have.

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:04.200 align:middle line:10%
Secondly, they know that
if people understood

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:08.610 align:middle line:10%
the power of consciousness,
and of mass consciousness,

01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:11.250 align:middle line:10%
they would be able
to completely change

01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:13.650 align:middle line:10%
the direction of the planet.

01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:15.663 align:middle line:90%
That is, to me, the big secret.

01:49:15.663 --> 01:49:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people have heard of the
random number generator studies

01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:20.038 align:middle line:84%
through the Global
Consciousness Project.

01:49:20.038 --> 01:49:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>> A question tonight.

01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:23.760 align:middle line:10%
Can you actually measure
the emotional outpouring

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.080 align:middle line:10%
in a worldwide crisis?

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Some scientists think that
they have done just that.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Their machines and computers
found a bizarre pattern right

01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:32.770 align:middle line:90%
after several global disasters.

01:49:32.770 --> 01:49:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> This was an experiment in
which researchers placed dozens

01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:39.570 align:middle line:84%
of random number generators
around the world and analyzed

01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
their data to see if they could
discover anything about global

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.480 align:middle line:90%
or collective consciousness.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> On September 11, a few hours
before the first plane struck,

01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:52.800 align:middle line:84%
this network of random
number generators became more

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.940 align:middle line:90%
coherent.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Less random and more coherent.

01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It may sound bizarre, but Dr.
Nelson and his team have been

01:49:58.770 --> 01:50:00.900 align:middle line:84%
at this for the better
part of a decade.

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The first spike
showed up in 1997

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.400 align:middle line:84%
with the death of
Princess Diana.

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Other events, like the
"Concorde" crash, the Madrid

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.080 align:middle line:84%
train bombing, and
the Pope's funeral

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.960 align:middle line:84%
all registered on those
random number generators.

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:15.630 align:middle line:10%
But early on the
morning of September 11,

01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:18.240 align:middle line:10%
the data went off the charts.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The odds of this being a
coincidence is less than 1

01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:25.380 align:middle line:90%
in 100 billion.

01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:28.500 align:middle line:84%
This shows there is
a deep relationship

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:32.880 align:middle line:84%
between collective consciousness
and the physical world.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Sociology studies
of meditators,

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:40.080 align:middle line:84%
where they go into a community--
say you have a town of 200,000

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:40.890 align:middle line:90%
people.

01:50:40.890 --> 01:50:44.700 align:middle line:10%
And they would send in 1% of
the population equivalent, 2,000

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:47.350 align:middle line:10%
people, to go into
deep meditation.

01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And they found that emergency
room visits declined,

01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:53.520 align:middle line:84%
violent crimes
declined, robberies,

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.190 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of negative
behaviors declined,

01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:57.840 align:middle line:84%
even though those
people didn't even

01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.010 align:middle line:90%
know they were in the city.

01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this resonant
effect through The Force,

01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:06.270 align:middle line:84%
if you want to look at it that
way, through this entangled,

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:09.180 align:middle line:90%
interwoven consciousness field.

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And people who didn't even know
these meditators were there

01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:15.180 align:middle line:84%
became more ordered, more
peaceful, more happy,

01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:16.660 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, and so on.

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This was actually based on
the studies done in quantum

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.740 align:middle line:84%
physics in which a container
of helium was cooled down

01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to absolute zero.

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
When only 1% of the helium
became aligned to coherent,

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.440 align:middle line:84%
the entire container went
through a phase transition,

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.960 align:middle line:84%
instantly shifting
into coherence

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and taking on almost
magical properties,

01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:40.680 align:middle line:90%
a state called super-fluidity.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was this
transformation at that 1%

01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:45.390 align:middle line:90%
point.

01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:48.330 align:middle line:84%
When a critical mass of
people, and whether it's 1%

01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:51.870 align:middle line:84%
or a fraction of that depends
on the state of consciousness

01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of those who are
practicing the meditation

01:51:55.050 --> 01:51:57.370 align:middle line:90%
or prayer or a coherence.

01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, you can
shift an entire civilization.

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.590 align:middle line:84%
If we all become
coherent, just 1% of us,

01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:07.980 align:middle line:84%
like a molecule of helium, and
we become aligned and coherent

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and move in the
right direction, it

01:52:10.410 --> 01:52:13.980 align:middle line:84%
will transform the other
99%, even though they

01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:15.370 align:middle line:90%
don't know that we're doing it.

01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
beauty and the power

01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:21.510 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of
nonlocality in consciousness,

01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:23.970 align:middle line:84%
is that it's all
interwoven, but there's

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:27.450 align:middle line:84%
enormous power when you're
operating at that deeper

01:52:27.450 --> 01:52:28.890 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:31.740 align:middle line:10%
And that the intelligence
community is very much afraid

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:36.120 align:middle line:10%
of, because that's something
A, they cannot control, and B,

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:41.460 align:middle line:10%
it would transcend their
ability to alter the outcome.

01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> "The total number of
minds in the universe is one.

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, consciousness
is a singularity

01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:51.150 align:middle line:90%
phasing within all beings."

Dr. Erwin Schrodinger, Nobel
Prize-winning physicist.

01:52:55.530 --> 01:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell a
really funny story.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.670 align:middle line:84%
In '92, the head of
Army Intelligence

01:52:59.670 --> 01:53:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and a few of his
minions intercepted me

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and took me to a hotel
room, very threatening.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a National Security
Agency person there,

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.770 align:middle line:90%
CIA people.

01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:10.187 align:middle line:84%
They were saying, what the
hell do you think you're doing,

01:53:10.187 --> 01:53:13.200 align:middle line:84%
teaching people to
bypass our systems

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and contact these civilizations?

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:18.810 align:middle line:10%
I said, I don't recognize your
authority over this matter.

01:53:18.810 --> 01:53:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And then I looked
them in the eyes

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.500 align:middle line:10%
and I said, I'm
not afraid of you,

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:27.230 align:middle line:10%
because I died when I was 17,
and I know there is no death.

01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:28.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't care about your money.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.250 align:middle line:10%
And I've had direct contact
with these civilizations,

01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:33.740 align:middle line:10%
so you can't deceive
me about who they are

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.490 align:middle line:10%
and why they're here.

01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And the general just
sat back like this

01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and went, well, we know exactly
who this son of a bitch is.

01:53:40.130 --> 01:53:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we're going to do.

01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:45.200 align:middle line:10%
It was very
frustrating for them,

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:48.750 align:middle line:10%
but later, a member of one of
the European royal families,

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:51.890 align:middle line:10%
who I don't want to name, who
was involved with that crowd,

01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:52.790 align:middle line:10%
came up to me.

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you know, they're
very jealous of what you

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and your team are doing.

01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, jealous of what?

01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:01.370 align:middle line:84%
These are the most powerful
people in the-- he says, no.

01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They know that you guys
actually collectively

01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:06.830 align:middle line:90%
have all the power.

01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And they wish they could
do what you're doing.

01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're in the box of this
national security state program

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.560 align:middle line:90%
that they cannot escape from.

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And you're free.

01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:18.800 align:middle line:90%
You're a free agent.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You're free to do wonderful
things, and they're not.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're really jealous
of what you guys are doing.

01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a real insight
into the sad psychology

01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of the people who are in
this pinched, small world.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So I say to the public,
you should be happy

01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
part of all of that.

01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You have the freedom to do
things they can never do.

01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:43.040 align:middle line:90%
So let's do it.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It is good to know that we
have the tools we need when we

01:54:47.690 --> 01:54:49.760 align:middle line:90%
apply CE-5 protocols.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So anybody can do
it no matter where

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:55.190 align:middle line:90%
you're from, what background.

01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You can just learn
the protocols.

01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.875 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of friends
from around the world who

01:54:58.875 --> 01:55:00.500 align:middle line:84%
never been on one of
these expeditions,

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and they just go online
and use the protocols

01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and apply them and have
wonderful experiences.

You have a clearness in

Can you bring your mind and

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and invite these civilizations

01:56:58.830 --> 01:57:02.370 align:middle line:84%
in this great purpose,
this great journey

that we're launching
on as a civilization,

01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:06.780 align:middle line:84%
where we are going to
become interstellar?

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, there was a
colonel named Phillip Corso.

01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Corso wrote a
book, "The Day After Roswell".

01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And one of the events
that wasn't known

01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:18.210 align:middle line:10%
was this encounter
he had with an ET

01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:21.480 align:middle line:10%
at White Sands
Missile Range, not far

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.390 align:middle line:10%
from where the first
atomic bomb was dropped.

01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:middle line:10%
And this was 1956.

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And an interstellar vehicle
came in, and it landed.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So he gets in his Jeep
and rushes out there,

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:36.030 align:middle line:84%
this is a young, brash,
colonel, and has a meeting,

01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:37.740 align:middle line:90%
an encounter with this ET.

01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.530 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, the
ET asked the colonel

01:57:40.530 --> 01:57:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to switch off these "radar
systems" that had piggybacked

01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:46.680 align:middle line:84%
on them, electronic
warfare systems that were

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:48.900 align:middle line:90%
knocking these spacecraft down.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel leaned in and
said, what's in it for me?

01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:55.950 align:middle line:90%


01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And the ET looked at him
and said, a new world,

01:57:59.090 --> 01:58:00.020 align:middle line:90%
if you can take it.
