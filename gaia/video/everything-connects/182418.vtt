A piece of clothing isn't
just a piece of clothing

that's in a store where
there are retail employees.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:10%
It's a whole system of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:10%
the cut and sew,
the transportation

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:10%
to get that piece of textile
from point A to point B.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then even further
back, it's farmers

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that are growing this
textile to make this product.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:10%
And very often, we only see
what's right in front of us.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got to start thinking
about how much resource it

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.545 align:middle line:84%

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
To make clothes, we use
plants, animal skins, and more.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
To make computers and phones,
we mine metals, use plastics,

and lots of other things.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
The problem is there's
only one Earth.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we run out of
materials, that's it.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Plus, just making stuff
creates waste, a lot of waste.

>> If a new item
is manufactured,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
there's waste in that
manufacturing process.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:84%
There's waste in the shipping
process to get it to the user.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in packaging that
the user then takes the item

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:90%
out of, and that becomes waste.

and it's packaged in plastic

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and then a box and
then another box.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When things get shipped,
we take a packaged product

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and then wrap more layers around
it like foam or plastic bags.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then all of that
goes into a box.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
That uses even more resources
and creates more waste.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, if
you think about it,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
we use a lot of resources
to make some things that

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:90%

And that adds up very quickly.

>> Once you inherit that
disposable mentality and really

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:10%
feed it on a daily basis,
you start treating everything

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:10%
as disposable.

Thousands of years from

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%

be proud to leave behind.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.736 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) It's a special
little treat when we get to eat

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:10%
the paper.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:10%
Yes, indeed.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.353 align:middle line:10%
So if you've got a
cup or a napkin or bag

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:10%
that you don't think you
need, don't forget to feed,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:10%
don't forget to feed
the wasts baskets.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Often, when things
go into a trash bin,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:10%
they become invisible.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
That idea of away,
things go away.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:90%
People.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Think once it leaves your hand,
it's an issue of yours anymore.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> When you throw garbage out,
it'll get picked up by a giant

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:90%
truck.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then that truck will then
bring your garbage sometimes

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to a train, which will
then carry your garbage

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to a landfill far, far
away, which could sometimes

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
be a few hours or a
few days trip even.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of fuel and
a lot of carbon emissions.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Landfills are generating
a lot of methane.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
They're the third
largest generator

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
of methane gas in the
United States right now.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge problem.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
We really don't
want to be putting

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:84%
more things into our landfills
and creating all this methane

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:90%
gas.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Methane gas is one of the
leading causes of climate

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And climate change is
already causing huge problems

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just what's going
into the air from landfills.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It's also what's
going into the ground.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens at the bottom
of a landfill is there's a lot

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
of liquid that builds up.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes landfills do have
tears or rips at the bottom.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So that liquid gets
released into the soil

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and then makes its way
throughout the land and then

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
into the underground water
and then, eventually,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the water supply.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Landfills are also a problem
because we are starting to run

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:90%
out of space.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So in our county right
now, our landfill

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
only has a few more years before
it's actually going to be full.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Landfills have become huge
manmade mountains of trash.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But as big as they are,
they fill up all the time.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So we take over more land,
create new landfills,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
throw away more trash.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It seems crazy, doesn't it?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Here's a question for you.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:10%
Think of something that
we can't live without yet

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:10%
we throw it away
by the truckloads.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Food.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In the United States, I
think it's about 40% of food

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:90%
produced, it's all wasted.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> 40% of our food is being
thrown away every year

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all thrown out, left to
scraps, thrown in the dumpster.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> For every piece
of food wasted,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
all of the energy and
the resources that went

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
into growing it, trucking
it, packaging it,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and then disposing
of it are all wasted.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's our disconnect
to nature and also this

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
illusion of abundance, of
infinite abundance where we

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
think that all the shelves
of the stores are ever

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
replenishing and it's going
to continue to stay that way,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:90%
so we treat it as such.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When you get all your
food at the grocery store,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to forget that it
all originates from the earth.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But as more and more
people live here,

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
we need more and more
resources to feed everyone.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, we're in
transition from an era of food

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:90%
abundance to one of scarcity.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:10%
By 2050, we're going to need
about 70% more food production

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:10%
to feed our booming population.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> 70% more food is a problem.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is a big place.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
But about 3/4 of it is water.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
As you can imagine,
the oceans are not

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:90%
a good place to grow food.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The 1/4 that's land,
well, a lot of that

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
is mountains, swamps,
and other places

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that are tough to grow on.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, only
about 3 and 1/2 percent

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of the entire Earth's
surface can easily

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
be used for agriculture.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
That has led to something
called intensive farming.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What intensive farming is
is you take a piece of land

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and you maximize the
production of that land as much

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Farms became big business.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:10%
And now we have these big
conglomerate of farms,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:10%
and that's driven a big
investment in fertilizers

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:10%
and the kinds of items
that aren't good for us,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:10%
aren't healthy for us.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And the small farms
are disappearing.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to prepare these
huge fields for new crops,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
factory farms repeatedly
till the soil.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Seems like a good thing, right?

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's not.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When you over till, you
are turning up the life

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%
in the soil.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And that exposes that life,
which holds the soil together,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to sunlight and
kills that soil life.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, what
you're left with is dirt.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference
between soil and dirt.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Soil is living.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Dirt is not living.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was one of the
great lessons of the 1930s,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
the Dust Bowl.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
The farmers used their
machines to plow the land.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:90%
The tilled soil turned to dust.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And the winds blew it into
a giant choking blizzard.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about tilling,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
since it kills off the organisms
and nutrients in the soil,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
farmers have to spray chemical
fertilizers on the crops.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's man trying
to conquer nature.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So man is trying to strictly
control the natural world

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
by spraying chemicals, by
spraying things like pesticides

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and herbicides that are
going to kill things

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
in the natural world.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that disconnect we have
thinking that we are separate

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
from nature, thinking that
we are superior to nature,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
thinking that we are somehow
dominant to the natural world.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:10%
>> No chemical is totally
safe all the time everywhere.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:10%
But with a world wide
shortage of food,

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:10%
we need chemicals like
potassium sorbate.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Without chemicals, life
itself would be impossible.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Those chemical fertilizers
and nitrates and chemical

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
pesticides that are water
soluble are leaching

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
into the groundwater.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And they flow down that river.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Then that nitrate would affect
the ecosystem of that watershed

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and destroy keystone species,
for example, like our salmon.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to look at farming
and industry, shipping,

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:10%
All of those things are
producing some level

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:10%
of contaminants
and pollutants that

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:10%
are not natural to the
systems that they're entering.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we put something into
a system that's not natural,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:90%
it can cause negative impacts.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, the water and the
chemicals end up in the ocean.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
In some areas like
the Gulf of Mexico,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
so many chemicals end
up there that it creates

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%
something called a dead zone.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound
very good, does it?

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a huge
dead zone there,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
which really means that
there's no oxygen in the water.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the fish and
marine life simply die.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> We also eat a lot of fish.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is there
are over 7 billion of us.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've become very good at
catching huge amounts of fish,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the same fish that lots of
other animals rely on for food.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> At the whale museum, one of
the things that we focus on is

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
stewardship for a marine
ecosystem known as the Salish

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Sea.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And our primary focus is
an endangered population

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of whales known as the
southern resident killer whale.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And in our region, not only
are these whales endangered,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
but all of our runs
of salmon are also

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:90%
threatened or endangered.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.033 align:middle line:84%
So you have an endangered whale
looking for an endangered fish.

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're really concerned about
the health of an ecosystem

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
not just from the toxics
and pollutions level,

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
but we're also concerned
from sustainability

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and overconsumption
and mismanagement.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> This is all
sounding pretty bad.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But we've only talked about
half of the food problem.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we don't just eat
fruits, vegetables, and fish.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.515 align:middle line:90%
Billions of us also eat meat.

00:15:31.515 --> 00:15:35.668 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) America
comes home to Holly Farms.

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:10%
It's the taste as
welcome as two open arms.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to keep up with the
meat demand for a few billion

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:84%
people, big factory farms
for animals were built.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And just like
factory crop farms,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
one of their goals is
to maximize production.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Where you get your milk,
where you would get your meat,

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
they usually don't come from
animals on this beautiful farm

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
underneath the sun in
this lush atmosphere.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing the
research online,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
you'll see videos of
what a factory farm looks

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:90%
like from the inside.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's really not pretty.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:10%
For example, chickens, they
have to burn off their beaks

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:10%
so that they can't
peck each other.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Most dairy cows spend
their lives in barren pens,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:10%
standing in dirt, mud,
and their own waste.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Those animals are
in confined areas.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And when any population is
in a small amount of area,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:10%
it has limited
resources to operate on.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Manure concentrations can
increase, for example.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that we frequently

00:16:43.145 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
see in small feedlots is
there's lots of manure.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And there isn't necessarily
a good place to put it.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:10%
>> You're looking at a lake
of toxic pig feces and urine

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:10%
the size of four
football fields.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:10%
That's because thousands
upon thousands of pigs

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:10%
are inside of these buildings.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Their waste falls through
slats in the concrete floor

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:10%
and it's flushed directly into
this giant open air cesspool.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Industrial agriculture is
one of the biggest pollutants

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't care about
where our food's coming from,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
we're going to lose
our environment.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lose the benefits
we get out of our environment.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to be healthy people.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> This all seems
a little scary.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to feel helpless.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's a word
you should know about,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
a word that can give
us hope for the future.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
That word is sustainability.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's the key to fixing
all of the problems we've

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The definition for
sustainability, for me,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
means being mindful of my
whole ecosystem that I'm a part

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:90%
of, that my family's a part of.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Sustainable means living
in a way that can be continued

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:90%
for indefinitely.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It means making sure that
I'm being as thoughtful as I can

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
in the purchases
that I'm making.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It is essentially the
capacity for humans and nature

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to endure and prosper
both short and long term.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it
is the difference

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
between life and death.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The scope of the
challenge is overwhelming.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I think especially for young
people but even for adults,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
it is a huge burden to take
on to try and save the planet

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
from imminent destruction.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing to remember is
that everything connects.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens on
Earth affects you.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And what you do
affects the Earth.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand
the damage we're doing,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
we can make the
smart choices that

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:90%
make living here sustainable.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's the good news.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
There are lots and lots of
things we can do right now,

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:90%
especially kids.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>> We got to get kids out
from behind their desks,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:10%
out from the walls
of their classrooms,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:10%
and into the real world.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> This is our green team,
our team of green team.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Our green team
created this program

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
where we teach
younger and older kids

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
where to put the trash and
recycling and their food.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We've already been able to
divert over 50% of the items

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
here on our campus
away from landfills.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
That's an increase
of 42% so far.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Keeping things out of the
landfill is one step towards

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:90%
sustainability.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead of throwing
everything into the trash can,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
take a minute to
use recycling bins.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you really want to
see how much you throw away,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
you can do something
called a trash audit.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
That's where you literally
open up your trash bags

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and inventory what it is
you're sending to a landfill.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You have this bag where
everything is the same.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And when it's all mixed
together, it's all trash,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and it all has to end
up in the landfill.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.665 align:middle line:84%
But as you're
picking through it,

00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
you get to really see
the amount of materials

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're throwing
out as garbage and end

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.818 align:middle line:84%
up getting landfillled that
can be recycled or diverted.

00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's really eye
opening to get it

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:90%
laid out all in front of you.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
The zero waste
schools is a program

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that just launched this
fall in 100 schools

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:90%
in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's our first
attempt at really

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
pushing the city and our
schools to achieve zero waste.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So we define zero waste
here with zero waste schools

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
as by diverting
every material that

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
comes into the school that's
recyclable or compostable

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:84%
leaving us with a very
small percentage of waste

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that actually needs to
end up in a landfill.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can recycle
and we can compost.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are familiar
with recycling.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:90%
But what is composting?

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of like nature's
version of recycling.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Anything that was
once a living thing,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
like most of our
food or yard waste,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:90%
can be gathered together.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And the natural cycle of life
eventually decomposes it.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
What you're left with is
something truly amazing.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It turns it all into rich soil.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Soils are so important
for us right now.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:10%
We are depleting our
soils through some

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:10%
of our farming practices.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:10%
We really need the compost
to help replenish our soils.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The next time you throw away
some food, think about this.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
The food that's lost or
wasted around the world

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is enough to feed
over 3 billion people.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
A big part of all
that wasted food

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
comes from places like
restaurants and grocery stores.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So some organizations
are stepping in

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
to help by actually
picking up that food waste

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and taking it to be composted.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as
compostable material,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
we're picking up all food
waste from fruits and vegetable

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
peels, coffee grounds, coffee
filters right through shells

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and meat and bones.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So far, we've collected about
630,000 pounds of oyster shell,

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:10%
which all would have been in
the landfill had we not taken it

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:10%
out of the waste stream.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We picked up about
16 tons of food waste.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Another great way you can
reduce your trash is to buy

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.652 align:middle line:84%
products that don't
have a ton of packaging.

00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Lots of things you
get at the store

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
have extra packaging
that ends up as waste.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I have students that walk
up to me, just the other day,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
he bought some type of Oreo
product and it was double

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
wrapped.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
The individual cookie
was wrapped individually,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and then they put it
in another package.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
He's says, I can't believe
they did this, Mr. Walters.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, see this phone number
on the back, call them.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell them to stop it.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And now some stores are
opening that sell things with

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%
no packaging at all.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:10%
>> We started this company
because we wanted to be

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:10%
actionable about making zero
waste living easy for every

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:10%
kind of person.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Every single product,
we like to try to provide

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:10%
an alternative and say that you
always have a choice and you

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:10%
always make an impact.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:10%
But whether or not that
impact is positive or negative

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:10%
is up to you.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the stores in
California are starting

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
to offer products that you
can bring your own container.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's stop for a minute
and think about one really good

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
way to eliminate trash and
live a sustainable life.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the answer
is kind of obvious.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Just don't buy certain products.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Reducing your waist could
be as simple as saying no.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:10%
So that doesn't have to
cost anything at all.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:10%
So saying no to single use
disposable straws and bags

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:10%
and to-go containers.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> One use plastic bags that you
take home from a grocery store

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:84%
or another store are easily
replaced when you can bring

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:90%
your own bag.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And then straws, we could easily
replace them with paper straws

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.605 align:middle line:90%
or compostable straws.

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:10%
>> If you go to a
restaurant with your family

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:10%
and you're like, you know,
I want a drink but no straw,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:10%
please.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:10%
I don't want the
single use napkin.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:10%
There are things that you
can do in your own life.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next year's project is
to go up Garnett and Pacific

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Beach, which is home to many,
many bars and restaurants,

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and get them to reduce or
eliminate straws altogether.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Convenience has become more
of just the conditioning that

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
we've inherited from
society, from our parents,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%
from our friends.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You could also refuse
cheap plastic toys.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not really something
that's going to last.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Most of those items,
you're either over it

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
or it's broken within the first
half an hour of acquiring it.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And then it's a trash item.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And refusing products
applies to clothing too.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
That means ignoring the
pressure to always have

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:90%
the latest fashion.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now in the
clothing industry,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
we have something
called fast fashion.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The fast fashion industry
is encouraging this culture

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:10%
of disposable clothing, which
is incredibly resource, time,

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:10%
and labor intensive.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.815 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't need to be buying a
new t-shirt every three months,

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of what the
fashion industry would like you

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So to be sustainable, we
should refuse to buy stuff that

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
hurts the planet,
reduce how much we buy,

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and recycle the things we have.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
more option, reuse.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Things you might think of as
trash might just be the thing

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
somebody else needs.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what they do at a
place called The Exchange.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>> The beauty of The Exchange is
rather than throwing something

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:10%
away and single use mentality,
we are going to save those

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:10%
things and redistribute them
to people that may want or need

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:10%
them.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
When we take an item
in The Exchange,

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
there's no packaging
involved with it.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And the item goes
back out the door.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the same item, but you
eliminate the production waste,

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the transportation waste,
and the distribution waste.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
The hope is to divert up to
10% of the current waste stream

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:84%
just by saving those
items that are reusable,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that are still good, and
that someone else would want.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, we've heard some
really great ideas on reducing

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
or eliminating waste.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about something
we all like to do, eat.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:10%
Remember when we said that we
were going to need 70% more

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:10%
food in the coming decades?

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
How do we make enough
without taking over more land

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and using more chemicals?

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The way we're doing it now
is we're relying on chemical

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
inputs and technological
fixes, so that we could feed

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:90%
the population we have.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But that won't sustain
itself for very long.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Organic small scale farming
really can feed the world.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Permaculture does work.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Organic small scale
farming, permaculture,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at exactly
what those things are.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Organic is really just a
fancy way of saying normal

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.060 align:middle line:90%
That's all it really means.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the food that
our great, great grandfathers

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and all the generations
before that ate.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
That's essentially
what organic means.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the time
when people say,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
what is organic
agriculture, they think, oh,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:90%
it's you don't spray chemicals.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't spray
chemical fertilizer.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't spray
herbicides or pesticides.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
That's true to an extent.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're also doing
a lot more than that.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature knows how to
grow things really well.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
After all, the Earth was
covered with dense vegetation

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
for billions of years
before humans existed.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we grow food
using nature's secrets,

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.187 align:middle line:90%
that's permaculture.

00:27:04.187 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Permaculture means you're
farming in a way to emulate

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, you're copying
natural principles that exist

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and putting them into
an agricultural space.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:90%
So on our farm, we have fields.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:90%
We have wetlands.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We have zones where
we can have songbirds

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:90%
live, so little forested areas.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
We have open fields.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We have large trees
for birds of prey.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.348 align:middle line:84%
So we've created all
these different habitats

00:27:31.348 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
for all of these
different creatures.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of these creatures
help manage the farm.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You set up an ecosystem
and it runs itself.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In this youth
garden behind me,

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
we actually have two
hugelkultur mounds.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And a hugelkultur
mound is a design

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
where you are emulating a
nursery log in a forest,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.110 align:middle line:90%
So for us, we put deadwood.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Then we put woodchip.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we put dirt
and then compost.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the
summertime, the water

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that has been stored in that
wood, the deadwood that's

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
decomposing inside
your mound will

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
be able to act-- it acts as
a sponge and then is released

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.875 align:middle line:84%
on hot days, so plants
can have access to water.

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you're trying
to create a system that you

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
don't need to ever water.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And here's the great
thing, sustainable farming is

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.742 align:middle line:84%
something everyone can do
at home or even at school.

00:28:24.742 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Island Grown Schools has
been working on bringing garden

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
education into the
public schools.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:10%
They run a school
garden at each school,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:10%
so kids actually get
to experience planting

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:10%
and harvesting vegetables.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You can grow your own
food, whether it's outside

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.307 align:middle line:84%
in a garden or there's
some small indoor systems.

00:28:43.307 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I help with the garden.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:10%
We grow a lot of
our own food there,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.663 align:middle line:10%
like tomatoes, cucumbers.

00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We have lettuce there.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If you start with that and
you grow your first carrot

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and you experience the joy
of pulling that carrot out

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.195 align:middle line:84%
of the ground for the first
time, you'll be hooked.

00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And that carrot,
I guarantee you,

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
will be the sweetest
carrot you've ever eaten.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
On average, American cities can
produce 50% of their own food

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
just in your front
yard or your backyard

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:90%
or on your roof in some cases.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Think about how much time and
effort we put into making sure

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
our yards are covered
with perfect green grass.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But what if we make some or all
of our yards into garden space?

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Think about how much
food we could produce.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We are here on our
40 acre plus farm.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And behind us is our 32,000
square foot hydroponic

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:90%
aquaponic greenhouse.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We're growing crops
indoors, so growing things like

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.820 align:middle line:84%
hydroponic lettuce and
strawberries, cucumbers, herbs.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can grow our
own food year round.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And we basically provide
a lot of that food

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:84%
for free to some of the shelters
and some of the food pantries.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we also sell it at
very low cost to the schools,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
so that the schools can
incorporate good healthy greens

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.368 align:middle line:90%
for kids year round.

00:29:55.368 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
well, why can't we

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:90%
just fly it in from California?

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about the
carbon impact of that.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
environmental impact of that.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So what we really want to do
is become more self-sufficient.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Just south of the Hague
in the Westland region

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Netherlands, miles upon
miles of greenhouses are spread

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:90%
across the landscape.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
They've been built by Dutch
farmers as part of a 20 year

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:84%
movement by the country to
pursue sustainable agriculture

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:90%
by growing indoors.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Growing techniques have helped
foster an indoor growing

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:90%
boom in the Netherlands.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Greenhouses now produce 35%
of the country's vegetables,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:84%
despite occupying less
than 1% of its farmland.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing food indoors
has huge benefits.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
You can grow more food in less
space than you can outdoors.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Plus, crops are protected
from bad weather and insects.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the water used
can be recycled.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
That all means that
more of your food

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:90%
can come from a local source.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There's definitely a savings
when you're buying products

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
from your local community versus
shipping in products that are

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:84%
grown sometimes nationally or
sometimes even internationally.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:84%
They looked at some
frozen asparagus thinking

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, this is a
great thing to give kids

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.260 align:middle line:90%
a chance to try asparagus.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
normally on the menu.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.705 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that asparagus

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
was grown in South America,
shipped to China for freezing

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and processing, and then
shipped back to the US.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So it had this massive
food miles on it.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:29.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Much of the food you find
on the shelves that is raw,

00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:90%
it's been picked away too early.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not as nutritious.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason why food
is picked up early

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is because it has to
survive the transportation.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's traveled hundreds
if not thousands of miles

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:90%
to hit your shelves.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If they pick it when it's
supposed to be picked

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually ripe,
it's going to soften.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It won't be-- no
one's going to buy it.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want to
really be sustainable,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.050 align:middle line:84%
if you want to help the Earth,
you need to grow your own food.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But what about
meat or seafood?

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Should we raise
animals in our yard?

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The answer to this
is a little tricky.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious,
but remember

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:90%
that animals have to eat too.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to grow food just
for them, a lot of food.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the United States,
about 95% of all oat production

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.877 align:middle line:84%
and 80% of all corn production
is used just to feed animals.

00:32:19.877 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's something to think about.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:84%
If we stopped eating meat
and used all of the crops

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to feed people
instead of animals,

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:84%
we could feed an additional
4 billion people, 4 billion.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
we need to eat meat

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:90%
in order to get enough protein.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, the
protein we get from meat

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually just the protein the
animals got by eating plants.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Plus, there are some negative
effects to our bodies

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:90%
when we eat meat.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Meat, it turns out, is
actually the leading cause

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:84%
of chronic illnesses
in the country.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a meat-based diet.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:90%
So if you do eat meat, it's OK.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't start
judging yourself.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But you could try doing
things like a meatless Monday.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
You could try a
weekday vegetarian

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
or just try purchasing meat that
is more local or at least more

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:90%
sustainably raised.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:10%
>> I would challenge people
to try a meat free day,

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:10%
just one day.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Just try it.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:90%
See if you can do it.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I think you can.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Making informed
choices about what we eat,

00:33:25.347 --> 00:33:27.680 align:middle line:84%
what we put on our plate,
what we purchase in the stores

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
or in restaurants goes a long
way collectively to better

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:90%
managing our ecosystems.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We humans are
pretty powerful.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Our amazing innovative spirit
has made life a lot easier.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But we're so good at it, we've
created unsustainable growth.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in just the time
we've been watching this video,

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:84%
over 8,000 babies
have been born.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that we can
use our knowledge to fix things.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really going
back to our roots.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It's going back to our intrinsic
nature, which is nature.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
where we come from,

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
where everything we have, know,
love, and live for comes from.
