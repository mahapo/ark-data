00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) Humans
hundreds of thousands of years

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:90%
as hunter-gatherers.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, suddenly, around 8,000
BC, we discovered civilization.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
This anomaly was the subject of
an investigation commissioned

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
by NASA, which pointed
to a disturbing trend

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
in evolved civilizations
suddenly appearing completely

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
developed, and to technology,
agriculture, science,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, and astronomy
suddenly manifesting

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in Mesopotamia, Egypt,
Yucatan, China, and Peru.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Did humans experience a
collective inspiration?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Or was civilization
inherited from someone else?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Because around the
same time, there

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
emerged stories of unusual
people, gods by any other name,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
appearing out of nowhere,
each possessing great skills

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
far beyond the capability
of hunter-gatherers.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:90%
If so, who were these gods?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:10%
Were they connected?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
where did they come from?

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
There are close to 200
accounts from indigenous people

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
around the world describing a
global flood 11,000 years ago

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and how it wiped out
most of the human race

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
as well as a parallel
race of unusual people,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:84%
human-like, but
not quite like us.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It also submerged the island
nations where these gods lived,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
which is why it's been very
difficult to locate them up

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:90%
until now.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you read the stories
together and observe

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
the similarities, you
get the impression

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
they are more like
eyewitness accounts.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And two homelands of the
gods are very familiar,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But have we been so
obsessed with these two

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that we've ignored other
equally-important locations

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:84%
where a lost civilization of
antediluvian gods once dwelt?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:37.808 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) The
first question to ask

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is, how do landmasses
just disappear?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Historians writing
about this topic

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years ago were
much closer to events.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.472 align:middle line:84%
And they believed the Earth
can change dramatically

00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
in the blink of an eye.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to look so
far back to find missing lands.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Take the case of the St
Vincent islands still located

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
on naval charts in 1789 roughly
between Baja and Tahiti.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
A ship's log gives an account
of 12 days spent there

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and how the islands
were about 20 miles

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in circumference, wooded,
and moderately elevated.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The next ship the sale
there 30 years later

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
spent 46 days surveying
the area yet found nothing

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
except this colored water
to a depth of 720 feet.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
case of Davis island,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
500 miles southwest of South
America, a landmass so large,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
it stretched beyond the horizon
and was added to Naval charts

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in 1687.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, 35 years later, a Dutch
captain, en route to Australia,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%
went looking for it.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But the island was no
longer above sea level.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And the captain
continued his journey

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and stumbled upon Easter
Island by accident.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So his trip wasn't
a complete loss.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, two other islands
existed near Easter Island

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
as late as 1912.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But were no longer
there 20 years later

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
despite a failed three-week
search by the US Navy.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) The
point is that Earth

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is an unstable, unpredictable
evolving planet.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
And so is the solar system.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:10%
Expert astronomers like the
Chaldeans and the Chinese

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:10%
were under no illusion that
the orbits and velocities

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:10%
of planets are
absolute but subject

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:10%
to change and variation.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they forewarned
future citizens

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of the chaos such
changes periodically

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
bring upon the Earth,
one of them being

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the obliteration of all
traces of former civilizations

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:90%
by meteorites.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
One event was recorded by
the Hopi, the Egyptians,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
and the Tamil of southern India.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it describes a displacement
of the poles, a time when

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.322 align:middle line:90%
the Earth was upside down.

00:04:55.322 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And the story
appears to take place

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
around 13,000 BC when
a catastrophe generated

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
what is called the Oldest Dryas,
the first of three ice ages.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And the myths are
remarkably consistent with

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:90%
geologic and climatic data.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
In a similar event in
10,800 BC, the Earth

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
was hit by a fragmented meteor,
which led to the third ice

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:90%
age called the Younger Dryas.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And ancient cultures
claim this event

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:90%
reversed the Earth's rotation.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
An Egyptian priest
explained this

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
to a visiting Greek scholar
by the name of Solon.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said to this
man, there was a change

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in the rising and the
setting of the sun

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and the other heavenly bodies.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And those times, they
used to set in the quarter

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
where they now rise, and used
to rise where they now set.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
At certain periods,
the Earth revolves

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:90%
in the reverse direction.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And of all the changes which
take place in the heavens,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.216 align:middle line:84%
this reversal is the greatest
and the most complete.

00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Solon would
take back to Greece

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
another Egyptian account, that
of a sunken continent where

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
the gods once
lived, which became

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.125 align:middle line:84%
the foundation for Plato's
now-famous story of Atlantis.

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The Younger Dryas cold spell
continued for 900 years

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
before Earth was again subjected
to a barrage of meteorites

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:90%
around 9700 BC.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
This event generated
a global flood.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
The tsunami penetrated
Asia, reaching the Himalaya,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and into Tibet.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
In the Pacific Northwest,
tribes experienced

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
waves crossing the Cascades,
Olympic, and Rocky Mountains.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
At least three tribes
described their canoes

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
being dumped on the
summit of Mount Jefferson,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
an elevation of 10,000 feet.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of the flood
is in the Great Salt

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Lake in North America.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It is claimed that its
saltiness was acquired

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
from mineral salts
accumulating from rivers

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's a problem
with this theory.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The Great Salt Lake
is full of sea salt.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And the changing salinity
occurred around the same time

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that giant waves
overran the Rocky

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Mountains and central
plains of North America.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
(VOICEOVER) Survivors were few.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Along with world flood
myths are descriptions

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
of a pre-flood civilization
which architects

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
were magicians, builders of
impressive temples and cities

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
far beyond the capability
of cave dwellers.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Even they were not spared.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, groups of gods
appeared after the flood

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
at strategic locations,
each accompanied

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
by seven sages, or
craftspeople, to rebuild

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
the former world of the gods,
as ancient Egyptians wrote.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Echoes of this civilization
are everywhere.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:10%
In 1966, a row of stone
columns with inscriptions

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:10%
was found 55 miles
off the coast of Peru,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:10%
6,000 feet below the
present sea level.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Then there are the
examples on land,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
such as megaliths that are out
of proportion on tiny Pacific

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:90%
islands.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Oddly enough, in
the 16th century,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:10%
the notion that these
islands are the remains

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:10%
of a now-submerged continent
was a widely accepted idea based

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:10%
on evidence gained by the
Portuguese navigator Pedro de

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:10%
Queirós from islanders
he met on his travels.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:90%
And the lesson is this.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
If we examine the traditions
of indigenous people

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
whose ancestors were closer
to the events than we are,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
we gain a better understanding
of what our antediluvian

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
cousins were up to and how their
genius survives as a reminder

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that civilization is not
linear but an ongoing, cyclical

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.744 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.744 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Few have heard
of Easter Island's folklore

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:84%
as recorded by its relatively
unknown early inhabitants,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
the Waitaha, who describe
Easter Island as an archipelago.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:84%
This was many
thousands of years ago,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
before the rising
level, when, they say,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:84%
the stars shone in a different
sky, in a different pattern.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Every year, the
Waitaha said they

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
welcomed the appearance of a
double hull canoe to the gods.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:90%
And they called them Urukehu.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Urukehu are
described as star walkers

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and long distance voyagers who
traveled across the Pacific

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to and from a place called
Kainga Nuinui, which

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:90%
means "the enormous land."

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, one year, the canoe
failed to return when, I quote,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
"angry stars gathered
close to the moon

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to the tides of
chaos, the dreaded deluge."

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So this alone places
them on Easter Island

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
before 9700 BC, which is the
geological date of the Great

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Flood.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.417 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:10%
(VOICEOVER) The Urukehu survived
titanic waves in the Pacific

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:10%
and reached New Zealand.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Two generations after the
world turned by water,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
a female descendant,
called Hotu Matua,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
arrived back on Easter
Island with seven sages.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Hotu Matua was given
charge of mapping

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific and its missing
lands, many of which

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
had become islands due to
rapidly rising sea levels,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:90%
including her own homeland.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And then other
descendants of the Urukehu

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
arrive from a
continent to the east,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
where they'd lived for
a long period of time.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And these Urukehu are described
as tall, fair skinned,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
red haired with green eyes,
and blond with blue eyes.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And their image is
said to be depicted

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
in the oldest Moai of
Easter Island, whose

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:90%
extended chins portray beards.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:84%
While the cylinders
carved from red scoria

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and balanced on their heads,
depict their unusual hair

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
color, at least the
people of the Pacific.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And even though the Waitaha
account is over 11,000 years

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
old, there is no mention
of caving the Moai.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
The statues are already
an accepted presence

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
on the island, a testament
to their extreme antiquity.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is proved by the
location of the quarry, which

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
now lies 80 feet below
sea level, submerged

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
by the rising ocean at the
end of the Younger Dryas.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.376 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) After
the world turned

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
by water, the grandchildren
of the Urukehu set sail

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
from Easter Island to
locate the birthplace

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, a remote mountain
region on New Zealand's South

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Island.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
The three sacred sites stand in
a place of unparalleled beauty.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Te Kohanga, also known
as the Sacred Nest,

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
was once surrounded by
a lake and resembled

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:90%
a primordial island.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The second, Kura Tawhiti,
means "Distant School."

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It was the academy
of the Urukehu,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
with each stone set to hold
the wisdom of the gods.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Among the hundreds of
weathered limestone outcrops

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
stand other monoliths,
once shaped by human hands,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.410 align:middle line:84%
by the Keepers of Stone,
a group of stonemasons

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:84%
whom the Waitaha as
able to shape stone

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.495 align:middle line:90%
without breaking its spirit.

00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I recall the
first time I saw

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
these monoliths and
remarking how many of them

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:90%
don't look natural.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be shaped by
human hands, but obviously,

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
very weathered.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was impossible to
prove until I read the Waitaha

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
tradition in which they describe
the carving of the stones,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
particularly that of their
tutilary goddess, Marotini.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And their story goes like this.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
"Huge are the monuments
we carved at Te Kohanga.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
A towering column
of the purest stone

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
was shaped to place
Marotini in the land.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
We ask so much of
the stone shapers

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
when they carved her to
stand against the stars.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Tall timbers and
thick ropes lifted

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
them high above the
land to carve Marotini.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Ever higher they
climbed to cut away

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that curving charcoal
lines to reveal

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:90%
the beauty of our ancestor."

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) When might
the birthplace of the gods

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
have been established?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
If Urukehu were already
navigating the Pacific long

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:84%
before the flood,
ostensibly, they

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
could have been in New
Zealand before 10,000 BC.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha narrative
describes a calendar stone

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
somewhere amid the
Birthplace of the Gods.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Since ancient
temples memorialize

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
the date of their creation
by referencing specific stars

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
or constellations,
if the calendar

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
stone could be located, it
would provide a date reference.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
This worldwide practice
is called archeoastronomy.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I have spent a few
years hiking the ridges

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%
of the Birthplace of the Gods.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But nothing resembling
a calendar stone really

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:90%
stood out.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So I took my search
to a third bridge.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
As if the views of the valley
aren't enough of a distraction,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
there are also hundreds
of limestone outcrops

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:90%
to choose from.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And many have clearly been
shaped by water, undoubtedly.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But as I approached
an escarpment,

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
the main sacred site
at Kura Tawahiti

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:90%
came into view in the distance.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, one monolith
stood out from the rest.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It didn't look like
an active erosion.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a kind of
sundial with a protrusion

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
resembling a head and a
faint image of eyes, nose,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and a mouth.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But best of all, the only
bird in the entire valley

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
was perched on this stone,
a falcon, of all things.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And had I been an
ancient Egyptian,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I would have said, Horace
is nodding in agreement.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And these coincidences
happen all the time

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
when researching
ancient mysteries.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So I figured this
was a good omen

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and began taking
measurements of the sky.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So I stood in front
of the disk, with he

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
had aligned at the top ridge.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I took a compass
bearing and altitude.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But what was I supposed
to be aligning it to?

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, there are two
principal constellations

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:10%
in the mythology of the Waitaha,
one being the Southern Cross.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So if we roll back the sky
to the time of the flood,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
this constellation only begins
to appear above the stone

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
on the spring
equinox of 14,800 BC,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Milky Way,
this celestial river,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
flowing vertically as though
pouring out of the stone.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The effect must
have been magical.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is correct,
then the Urukehu

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
who would have had
to have been there

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
before the start of
the Oldest Dryas.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
But there's another possibility.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a second
constellation

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of note, which is Orion,
specifically its belt stars.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, Orion does not rise above
the background mountain range

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:10%
for another 4,000 years,
until the spring equinox

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:10%
of 10,800 BC, when its
belt aligns perfectly

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:10%
with the calendar stone.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:10%
And the date happens to
coincide with a period

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of meteorite impacts that
triggered the Younger Dryas.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But to see the
entire constellation,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
one has to wait until
the equinox in 10,400 BC.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I got goose bumps
when this date popped up.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it is commemorated at
several prominent monuments

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
the most well-known

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
being the Pyramids of Giza,
which mirror the Belt of Orion

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:90%
exactly on the same occasion.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out that there are

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
a number of overlapping
relationships between the gods

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.875 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt and the Urukehu.

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) At the same time
that Orion appears fully

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.535 align:middle line:84%
above the calendar the stone,
across the valley at Kura

00:16:46.535 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Tawhiti, the goddess Marotini
stares at the rising Southern

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Cross.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
This dual reference
offers a high probability

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Urukehu were
commemorating this date

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%
at the Birthplace of the Gods.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha narrative
describes that, whenever

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the Urukehu returned
from New Zealand,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
they would bypass Easter
Island due to the behavior

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean currents, visiting,
instead, the place of ancestors

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:90%
in the great lands in the east.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they undertook
this long voyage,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
they took to totem birds
with them, Titi and Caca.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Together, they give the
name to another homeland

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
of the gods,
Titicaca, the location

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of the temple city of Tiwanaku.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand
ancient places,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
it is useful to
turn to etymology,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
particularly the earliest
iterations of a name.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it often reveals a true
meaning, a purpose or an event.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the altiplano of
Bolivia, the oldest languages

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:90%
are Puquina and Aymara.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And the syllables
"Ti-wa-na-ku" mean "my people."

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Except that the syllable
"aku" is not Aymara.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:90%
It is Egyptian.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:90%
And it means "shining being."

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.932 align:middle line:84%
So Tiwanaku becomes "the
place of my shining people."

00:18:09.932 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) We'll return
to them in a moment.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Tiwanaku is composed
of six known

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:90%
temples covering 2,000 acres.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Its adjacent temple,
Puma Punku, is

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
packed with advanced
masonry, each stone above

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the skill of cavemen,
even latter-day stonemasons.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But how can we tell
if these temples

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
were built before the flood?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:84%
The focus of excavations by the
archaeologist Arthur Posnansky

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
was a quadrangle of
monolithic standing

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:90%
stones called the Kalasasaya.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And he noted how the alignment
was off by 18 degrees

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
relative to the sun
along the horizon.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is due to the effects
of the Earth's rotation

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and tilt, which causes
the stars to appear

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in a different part of the sky
over the course of millennia.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenon
called procession.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So was Posnansky
recalculated the correlation

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
between the stones
and the solstices.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And his figures
were peer reviewed

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
by a group of mathematicians
and deemed to be correct.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This massive quadrangle was
built, according to Posnansky,

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.544 align:middle line:90%
in 15,000 BC.

00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) But
there's something else.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Relative to its
adjacent temples,

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the Kalasasaya appears
to have been forced

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
to fit a pre-existing plan.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:10%
Because the three
adjacent sites,

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:10%
the Akapana mound, the
semi-subterranean temple,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:10%
as well as Puma Punku, are all
offset by a further 3 degrees.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They reference a
very different sky.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And given the greater
depth of sedimentation,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
it is likely these three
sides are even older.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:10%
It takes the Earth 21,600
years to tilt three degrees

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:10%
on its axis.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
If this correlation is
correct, then these three sites

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
could be as old as 36,000 BC.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And as extreme as
this date may sound,

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
there is another
link with Egypt here.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian King lists,
stated in the Turin papyrus,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
begins around 36,000
BC, a fact that

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
was shared with Greek historians
when they visited Egypt

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:90%
over 3,000 years ago.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And Posnansky himself
was also of the opinion

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that Tiwanaku was
built and rebuilt

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
over three different
stages, with the Akapana,

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
the semi-subterranean temple,
and Pumapunku referencing

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
a truly remote era, followed
by the Kalasasaya, and then

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
a rebuilding of the site
after it was destroyed

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
by a colossal wall of water
that came from the tipping

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:90%
over of lake Titicaca.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The only catastrophe we
know that was capable

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
of such destruction
was the Great Flood

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Younger Dryas.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) So who
were the gods who built

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the temple complex of Tiwanaku?

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And more to the point, who was
responsible for its rebuilding?

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The local Puquina still
teach their oral tradition

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of having fled to the Andes
after a flood sank their island

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.020 align:middle line:90%
continent in the Pacific.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
Lupakije, also known as Mu,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%
or as it became known, Lemuria.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And their story says
that the temples

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:84%
were rebuilt after the flood
that by the god man Viracocha

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
along with his seven
Hayhuaypanti, which

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
means sages,
craftspeople, one of whom

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%
was both his wife and sister.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly, this
is a shared observation all

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
around the world wherever the
gods alighted after the flood.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Hayhuaypanti translates as
"Shining Ones," the people

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:90%
for whom Tiwanaku was named.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
These seafaring gods
appeared from the Pacific.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
They were described as very
tall, white skinned, bearded,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
red haired, and were associated
with a symbol of the serpent.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
They were also defined by
their elongated skulls.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, a treasure trove of
skulls was found at Paracas

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:90%
on the coast of Peru.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And compared to human
skulls, these elongated heads

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
have a 25% larger
cranial capacity.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And although human skulls are
known to have been artificially

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
shaped by parents, wishing their
children to grow up looking

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
like the gods, artificially
shipping a skull cannot

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:90%
increase its cubic capacity.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, the
origins of their DNA

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
leads to the region of
the Black Sea, the Middle

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:90%
East, and Egypt.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So might Viracocha and
his seven Shining Ones

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
have been of
Egyptian provenance?

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:51.368 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:53.828 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:53.828 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Edfu, a temple dedicated
to the falcon god Horus.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Written on its walls
are the building texts.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They describe how
a group of gods

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
called Akhu Shemsu Hor began
arriving along the Nile

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
after a catastrophe partially
sank their homeland, Ta Neteru,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
an island somewhere in the
region of the Indian Ocean.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The event coincides
with the incident

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that caused the Younger
Dryas around 10,800 BC.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
They also had another
base, Iw Titi,

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
possible reference
to Lake Titicaca

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and its Island of the Sun.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:10%
The Akhu Shemsu Hor established
a series of sacred mounds

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:10%
along the Nile that became the
foundations of future temples.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The timing coincided
with an anomaly

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
in this region, an
agricultural revolution

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that appeared out of
nowhere in the Nile valley

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:90%
around 10,500 BC.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
The texts say that
within 800 years,

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
a second disaster sank
the primeval island

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of the gods for good,
whereupon one group

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of survivors returned to Egypt,
seven sages led by an eighth,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:90%
a charismatic leader called Hor.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
These were the Akhu
Shemsu Hor, which

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.895 align:middle line:84%
means "Shining Ones,"
followers of Horus.

00:24:33.895 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Like in other
parts of the world,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:84%
they, too, are described
as between 8 and 1/2

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to 10 feet tall, light
skinned, with elongated skulls.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And just as Viracocha
in South America,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
their stated task was to
rebuild the former mansions

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
What mansions might they have
come to rebuild in Egypt?

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love the building texts.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They describe the first
appearance of the Shining Ones,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the followers of Horus,
as the first occasion.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And the date is memorialized
in the alignment

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids of Giza in the
spring equinox of 10,400 BC.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:19.054 align:middle line:84%
But there is at least one
site that may be contemporary.

00:25:19.054 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) The
Osirion at Abydos

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
has always been regarded
as an underground temple.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is actually encased
in 40 feet of silt,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.100 align:middle line:84%
deposited inch by
inch by the Nile

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
when the river reached
the temple's doorstep,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and the regional climate
was wetter, the period

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:90%
between 10,500 to 7,000 BC.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
By 3,500 BC, the Nile had moved
over a mile east of Abydos.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Pharaohs were still building
temples around the Osirion,

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
yet none related to it,
as though the building was

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
no longer visible,
covered by sand and silt.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
All that remained
was the memory of why

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
the location was important.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, in 1300 BC, Seti
I built his own temple

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the same
axis as the Osirion.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Yet his masterpiece
stopped short

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of the underground
structure and bends

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to the left, in total
contradiction to temple

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
protocol, leaving its
most important room,

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:84%
the holy of holies,
decapitated from the body.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
The only reasonable
explanation is

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that the weight
of his own temple

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:84%
broke through the ceiling of
the now-underground structure.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that Seti
rediscovered the Osirion

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and wished to revive
its importance?

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
A clue lies in a
room built by Seti

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:84%
featuring a revealing panel
about the Osirion's namesake,

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:90%
the god man of Osiris.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is the hero who is
dismembered before he ascends

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the Milky Way towards
the Origin of Souls,

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%
typically, the pole star.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And he returns resurrected as
Horus in the form of a hawk.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And Osiris is also the
earthly embodiment of Orion.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, curiously,
Seti's own temple

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is not reference
the rising of Orion,

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
nor any other star
for that matter,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
another violation of protocol.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that this
pharaoh wished the Osirion

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:90%
to be the focal point.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And yet the Osirion does
not reference Orion either,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:10%
as one would expect for a
temple whose presiding god is

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:10%
the earthly embodiment
of this constellation.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:84%
However, Egyptian texts refer
to as Osiris's consort, Isis,

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:90%
as the hawk of Osiris.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And on this panel, she is
depicted as a kite hawk

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with outstretched wings,
demonstrating her ability

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to fan the breath of immortality
into those she oversaw.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
For this to occur,
the soul of the hero

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:84%
must reside in the
region of regeneration,

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:84%
which is the pole star, which is
protected by seven circumpolar

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.435 align:middle line:84%
stars called the
indestructibles.

00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, "indestructible"
is also a metaphor

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
of the regeneration of
the soul as exemplified

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
by the journey taken by Osiris
and performed at the Osirion.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps we should be looking
for a hawk in the night sky

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
in connection with this temple.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) In ancient
Egypt, the star Deneb

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:84%
was one of the seven
indestructibles.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Its host constellation
is Cygnus.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, Cygnus
was not regarded as a swan,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:90%
as it is today, but as a hawk.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And therein lies the
connection with Osiris,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
the wife who
resurrects his soul,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and the date when that
temple might have been built.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:84%
If we roll back the
sky, Cygnus the hawk

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
finally appears at the
entrance of the Osirion

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:84%
in perfect ascent,
riding up the Milky

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Way, this celestial river,
towards the location

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of the souls, with its
brightest star, Deneb,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
aligning with the
axis of the temple.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
This astonishing
event took place

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
on the winter solstice and
spring equinox of 10,500 BC.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We now have the
Shining Ones present

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
before and after the flood
in both Egypt and the Andes.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Both groups are described
as master seafarers

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and astronomers.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Both sites feature shared
megalithic construction

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:90%
methods, even anomalies.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, Viracocha
and his seven Shining Ones

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:84%
resembled the Urukehu gods of
New Zealand and Easter Island,

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the same red-haired,
seafaring astronomers who

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84%
employed identical building
methods throughout the Pacific.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
As for the Urukehu, they may
be the same followers of Horus.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because both their leaders were
navigators and astronomers.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And both held the
title Net of the World

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
for their ability to
map the rearranged lands

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And they are depicted as
such in the temple of Edfu.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, all the above
were associated with Orion.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
There are too many overlapping
criteria linking the flood gods

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.370 align:middle line:84%
in different corners
of the world,

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:84%
making it highly probable
that they aren't one

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and the same group of people.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Could they
also have in presence

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean?

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
11,000 years ago,
a stonemason living

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
between Tunisia and Sicily cut
a 39 foot monolith, drilled

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.940 align:middle line:84%
parallel holes, transported
it a quarter of a mile,

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.950 align:middle line:90%
and placed it upright.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, it lies 130 feet below
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The attached shells
are dated to 9,300 BC,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the menhir
was placed on dry land

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:84%
before the catastrophic rise
in sea level after the flood.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The rising Mediterranean
radically affected

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
nearby Malta, cutting
it off from Sicily,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:90%
and turning it into an island.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And Malta is home to
miles of parallel grooves

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
resembling cart ruts,
except that some

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.830 align:middle line:84%
show signs of having
been artificially

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
carved rather than created
by repetitive use of wheels.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
On the south side
of the island, they

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:90%
reached the edge of the cliff.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:90%
They dropped 600 feet.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Continue under
the Mediterranean,

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
then reappear on the summit
of an island three miles away.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The land bridge that once
connected the two islands

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
collapsed when great
pressure was placed upon it.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if early Roman
historians are correct,

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
this pressure was the result
of titanic waves traveling

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
from the west from the
direction of the Atlantic

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:90%
before smashing into Malta.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:48.800 align:middle line:84%
What is certain is that by 7,600
BC, the grooves were submerged.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Could the same tidal
waves have been

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
responsible for dumping 7,000
people, animals, and utensils

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
into the hypogeum
of Hal Saflieni,

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
including hundreds of
long-haired people?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
By this point, I had
developed a theory

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:84%
based on accumulated evidence
that the flood gods lived

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
in seclusion on islands,
including Tiwanaku,

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
which was designed like an
artificial island on Lake

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And only through
necessity, brought

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
about by severe
climatic changes,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
were they forced to move
to continental areas

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and interact with
ordinary people.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, this hypothesis fits
in well with the hundreds

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of flood stories which mentioned
the surviving gods arriving

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.106 align:middle line:84%
by boat from their
drowned lands.

00:32:36.106 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Was Malta home
to such a reclusive society?

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The archipelago features a
disproportionate concentration

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of temples resembling no
other, as though belonging

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to an isolated culture,
temples like Ggantija,

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:90%
the Tower of the Giantess.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Ggantija appears out
of nowhere, fully

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
developed, without
precedent, without

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:90%
a trial-and-error stage.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:90%
All the stones are megalithic.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:10%
But on top, we find inferior
stones, sloppy of construction,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:10%
as though rehabbed after
a major conflagration.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, all
Maltese temples

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate the kind
of erosion only made

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.310 align:middle line:84%
possible by prolonged exposure
to wet weather, which,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:24.800 align:middle line:84%
in this region, occurred in the
epoch of 10,000 to 8,000 BC.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, Malta shares the
same climatic footprints

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.000 align:middle line:90%
as the Giza Plateau.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the temples
adjacent to the pyramids

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
show exactly the same
pattern of erosion

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.835 align:middle line:90%
by enormous volumes of water.

00:33:38.835 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Might the
Maltese temples share

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
the same era as the
underwater monolith?

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:84%
To test this idea, let's
look at the archaeoastronamy

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
of Ggantija.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:10%
The temple features
two misaligned axes,

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:10%
as though tracking two
related yet separate objects

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The view of the
horizon is of a hill

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.360 align:middle line:84%
that has been deliberately
flattened, as though serving

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:90%
some astronomical function.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
As the sky rolls
backwards through time,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
no alignments are obvious until
the era of 12,000 BC, when,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:84%
on the spring equinox,
the first axes marks

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
the positions of a
major lunar standstill,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.195 align:middle line:84%
while the second axis
marks the sunrise.

00:34:20.195 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Another place where unusual
parallel grooves are found

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.500 align:middle line:90%
is the Azores.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:84%
And they too run to the edge
of cliffs and into the ocean.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Azores
archipelago is, of course,

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the favorite candidate
for Atlantis.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
And even discounting
a major subsidence

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-Atlantic ridge due
to damage from meteorite impacts

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and rising sea
levels, the Azores

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:84%
were still a formidable
island chain 11,000 years ago.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the
bathymetric maps of the region,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
they even bear a resemblance
to the continent once described

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.391 align:middle line:90%
and depicted on ancient maps.

00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) It is said
Atlantis sank in three stages,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
each following a natural
catastrophe, which

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.910 align:middle line:84%
sounds uncannily like a
description of the three

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
catastrophes that generated
each of the Dryas events.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
If so, we should find
evidence of dry land

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:31.810 align:middle line:84%
along the mid-Atlantic ridge
from before the first event.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, we
asked, could a landmass

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:84%
sink in the blink
of a geological eye?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
As history shows all
too often, yes, it can.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But an island the
size of a continent?

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, a local dredging operation
in the Azores in the 1970s

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:84%
recovered rocks at a
depth of 6,000 feet,

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
showing signs of
exposure to oxygen,

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
while sediment taken from
the mid-Atlantic ridge

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
revealed the remains
of freshwater plants

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and beach sand created
along an ancient shoreline,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:84%
indicating the Azores was still
above sea level in 15,000 BC.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So now the question is, what
happened to its civilization?

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, a funny thing happened
when I landed in the Azores

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:90%
on the way to Lisbon.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:10%
A headline in the
morning newspaper

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:10%
said, "Silva discovers
underwater pyramid."

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how
much work one can do

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.750 align:middle line:90%
while sleeping on an airplane.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns
out, it wasn't me.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It was another local
man by the same name who

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.470 align:middle line:84%
discovered a 180 foot tall
step pyramid perfectly aligned

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to the compass points, as
most pyramids tend to be,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and 120 feet below sea level.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.840 align:middle line:84%
The Portuguese navy
investigated the claim

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and said Silva was mistaken, his
sonar images captured nothing

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:84%
more than a sea mount,
perfectly aligned to grid north,

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and in the shape
of a step pyramid.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It's astonishing what
nature and erosion can do.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And later, it transpires
that the navy did not

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.020 align:middle line:84%
follow Silva's GPS
coordinates but searched

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.600 align:middle line:84%
the wrong area, to
which they replied,

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Silva had the wrong coordinates
because his equipment

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:90%
was faulty.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't it amazing
how, for 20 years,

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
this fisherman managed
to sail in the middle

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
of a volatile ocean, out
of sight of land, yet

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
managed to return
safely home each time.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that the bunkers
land to make up better stories.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.872 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:84%
(VOICEOVER) Who might the
Atlantean gods have been?

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The first landmass to the east
of the Azores is Portugal.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The oldest myths of the region
describe a great inundation

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and the sinking
of a great island

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
from which emerged a
group of unusual people

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.580 align:middle line:84%
called Offiusa, the
People of the Serpent.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to the west,
several groups of wise people

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
arrived in boats on
the coast of Yucatan.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The local tradition
states they migrated

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:84%
from stepping stone to
stepping stone from the east.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they hopped
from island to island,

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
all that remained of their
drowned homeland called Atl.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The sacred book Chilam
Balam puts the date

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to their arrival at
9,600 BC, the same date

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:23.180 align:middle line:84%
given by the Egyptians for
the sinking of Atlantis.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:10%
The collective
name of these gods

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:10%
was the Itz, meaning
"sorcerer," "magician."

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And their title of
sacred office was

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:84%
the Kanuul, which means the
"People of the Serpents."

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing
to do with snakes.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The symbolism implies people
who understood and control

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:84%
the forces of
electromagnetism, what

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
science called telluric
forces, or telluric currents.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And they refer to the land
where they disembarked,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Yucatan, as Mayab,
"the Land of the Few,"

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:84%
in recognition of the
survivors of the flood.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And in time, their
progeny would be called

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Maya, which means "water."

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Itz are described by
the Maya teachers as architects

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of the sky who
spoke [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:90%
"the Language of Light."

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Paints quite a
picture, doesn't it?

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.290 align:middle line:10%
And they're said to have arrived
in three groups of seven,

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.740 align:middle line:10%
each led by an eighth, a
charismatic leader, one of whom

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:10%
was called Itzamna.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:84%
He was tall, light-skinned,
with Caucasian features,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and a long beard, as were the
other two leaders, Kukulkan

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and Quetzalcoatl.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The Itz moved across
Yucatan, establishing

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
temple cities like Chichen
Itza, which bears their name,

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and Tikal and Uxmal,
whose temples reflect

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:90%
the architecture of the cosmos.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:84%
These were astral
academies, each building

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
encoded with their knowledge
of mathematics, science,

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and astronomy,
information brought

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
from a submerged homeland and
hardwired into huge monuments

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to ensure its survival
in future cataclysms.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.950 align:middle line:84%
In time, the buildings expanded
into the temples we see today.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The Its continued inland
and into the mountains

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of Guatemala, understandably
far from the ocean.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they
settled on a lake

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
called Atitlan, named for
their sunken island home,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:84%
where they built a
city called Utatlan

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
as a replica of the
one they'd lost.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Their other main center of
activity was on Lake Peten Itza

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Nojpeten.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And it means great island.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Although, a much larger
island exists nearby.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, what made this
island great was

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that it was their
main spiritual center,

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a scaled down version
of their lost Atl,

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:84%
or Atitlan, featuring 21
temples and a step pyramid.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no trace of any
temple on Nojpeten today,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:84%
all destroyed by
the Spanish, who

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:02.510 align:middle line:84%
used the temples as a
quarry for their own houses.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And even the name was
changed to Flores.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But why not use the bigger
island next door, I wondered?

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps the smaller
island's strategic view

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of the horizon down
the neck of the lake

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.040 align:middle line:84%
had something to do
with their decision.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.270 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to find out.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:10%
I reasoned that
the Great Pyramid

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.510 align:middle line:10%
must have stood where
the main church does

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:30.350 align:middle line:10%
today, standard Catholic
practice back in the day.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.688 align:middle line:90%
But how do you find out?

00:41:32.688 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, the standard
practice for the church

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
was to align its
buildings east to west

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to commemorate Christ's
death around the equinox.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, when they don't
follow this protocol

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:10%
it is proven again and again
that an original temple

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.080 align:middle line:10%
lies beneath.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
the church of Flores

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is not aligned in due east,
but towards the southeast.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Clearly superimposed upon
something much older.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Secondly, when I
asked the priest

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:10%
to see the stones
of the pyramid which

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.175 align:middle line:10%
formed the foundation
of the building

00:42:04.175 --> 00:42:09.050 align:middle line:10%
he booted me out in no uncertain
terms out of that church.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a sure sign you're
close to the honey pot.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the rest was
purely academic.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:84%
From the church's
vantage points you

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.580 align:middle line:84%
get an unobstructed
view of the horizon

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:90%
down the neck of the lake.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And in 7,600 BC
the winter solstice

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.670 align:middle line:84%
would have been aligned to
the nine-tier pyramid that

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.685 align:middle line:90%
once stood on this location.

00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:84%
According to the Maya, central
American temple tradition

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:84%
is the continuation of
Atitlan, the rebuilding

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:90%
of the former world of the gods.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:45.990 align:middle line:84%
One clue lies in the
Maya serpent dynasty,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:84%
which covers 16,000
years, and most likely

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:84%
originated in Aticlan
before continuing in Yucatan

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Another is the age of
the original temples.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They are built like
layers of an onion,

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
growing organically,
and adapting

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:84%
to the changes in the
movements of the planets

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:90%
and stars they track.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:84%
A recent excavation
on the corner

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.150 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid of
Kukulkan at Chichen Itza

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.840 align:middle line:84%
reveals an older layer, which
traditions claim was originally

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:90%
built by a serpent priest.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Is the Maya dynasty so old?

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:84%
358 cave systems were recently
found near the temple of Tulum,

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:84%
a submerged world filled with
the remains of enormous sloths,

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:84%
proto elephants, extinct
fauna, and Maya artifacts

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and skeletons, all trapped
by rising seas by 8,000 BC,

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:84%
validation that the
Maya were already

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:84%
established in the
Yucatan in remote times,

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and witnessed the arrival of the
Its from their sunken homeland.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet the people
of the serpent

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.490 align:middle line:84%
were present on the other
side of the world too.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a strange
coincidence that Itzamna

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is a compound name of
Itzanami and Izanagi,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.830 align:middle line:84%
who were the builders
of civilization

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.270 align:middle line:84%
after the flood in
Japan around 8,000 BC.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:14.490 align:middle line:10%
And here they are known as
Nagi, the people of the serpent.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Two such flood
heroes, Nuwa and Fuxi,

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:84%
founded the Chinese
dragon bloodline.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And this same dynasty
encompasses Indo-China,

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Polynesia, and
particularly Fiji and India

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:84%
where they are called
Naga, the serpent people.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you travel
in this part of the world,

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:84%
traditions describe
heroes emerging

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.780 align:middle line:84%
from a flood, accompanied
by seven Rishi, sages

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.180 align:middle line:84%
who instructed humans
on civilization,

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.510 align:middle line:84%
built megalithic structures,
and to all intents and purpose,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.290 align:middle line:84%
behaved like
magicians, always very

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
tall, light skinned, with blonde
or red hair, and long beards.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
The region where all of
these stories, people, names,

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and attributes converge
is upper Mesopotamia,

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.990 align:middle line:84%
where we find another kind
of missing land, the lost

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.040 align:middle line:90%
hill of Gobekli Tepe.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe was
rediscovered in the 1990s.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It is an artificial
mountain containing

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
at least 50 elliptical
enclosures, featuring standing

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:90%
stones as tall as 19 feet.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The average carbon-14
dating of the site

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is 9,984 BC, placing much
of it before the flood.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.710 align:middle line:84%
However, the samples were
taken from the walls,

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.010 align:middle line:84%
which obscure important
carvings on the pillars.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they were not
integral to the site.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The walls were added
later, after the temple

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.020 align:middle line:90%
ceased to function.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.010 align:middle line:84%
To get a sense of when
it might have been built

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
we turn again to the stars.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Enclosure D is the most studied,
perhaps because its pillars are

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:90%
the most decorated.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It has been suggested
that its alignment is

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to the northern
setting of Cygnus.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's a small
problem with this theory.

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:84%
This enclosure sits 30 feet
below the summit, which

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:90%
obscures one's line of vision.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, the
ancients rarely, if ever,

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:84%
celebrated descent of
a celestial object.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Only its rising or mid heaven
elevation was celebrated.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps a
re-evaluation is in order.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.340 align:middle line:84%
If we take the era of the
earliest carbon-14 dating,

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:84%
which is 10,290 BC, a number
of things begin to emerge.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.090 align:middle line:10%
In the northern
sky at this time,

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.600 align:middle line:10%
Vega was still
considered the pole star.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:84%
A view from enclosure D on the
winter solstice of 10,400 BC

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.610 align:middle line:84%
would have seen Vega
in elliptical rotation

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.190 align:middle line:90%
around the celestial pole.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And its movement is framed
by the two central pillars.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, Vega's appearance
after sunset

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is actually marked by pillar
43, the one carved with vultures

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.180 align:middle line:90%
moving around the circle.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Vega's name derives from Waki,
meaning falling or swooping,

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:84%
referring to a time when
the movement of its host

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:41.630 align:middle line:84%
constellation, Lyre,
resembled a swooping vulture.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So the pillar accurately
depicts the behavior

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.500 align:middle line:84%
of this star around
the celestial pole.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.000 align:middle line:90%
But we're missing the best part.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Enclosure D's clear line of
vision is to the southeast.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, with Vega
visible to the north,

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to the south the belt
of Orion rises briefly

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.280 align:middle line:84%
above the horizon on
the winter solstice,

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:84%
its narrow arc framed
by pillars 19 and 33,

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:84%
with pillar 32 marking
its highest ascension

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:90%
in the era of 10,400 BC.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So this reference to
Orion in 10,400 BC

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.900 align:middle line:84%
raises very important
issues, specifically

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:84%
with regard to Giza, where
the same relationship

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.240 align:middle line:90%
takes place on the same date.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
understanding of place names

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.910 align:middle line:90%
comes in very useful.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The original name of
Gobekli Tepe is Portasar.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:84%
An Armenian word breaks
into two syllables.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.190 align:middle line:10%
Port is an umbilical
cord, or navel.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And Asar is the
original name of Osiris.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the hill is the
umbilical cord of Osiris.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.520 align:middle line:84%
As we said earlier, Osiris
is the earthly embodiment

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, and his
dwelling place is Giza.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have a name
association and a date

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:90%
connecting two locations.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But what could this umbilical
cord be referring to?

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take a
line from the corner

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.650 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid
attributed to Menkaure

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and draw it through the corner
of the one attributed to Khufu,

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.790 align:middle line:84%
you arrive at Portasar,
the second dwelling

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:90%
place of Osiris.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So the name is giving us
a geodetic clue suggesting

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:90%
that the two sites are linked.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does this tell
us about the architects

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:90%
of Portasar?

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The hill's deliberate
southeastern exposure

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.310 align:middle line:84%
offers a sightline to an
ancient astronomical tower

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:44.010 align:middle line:90%
in the town of Harran.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:84%
There has been human activity
here since at least 8,000 BC.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Back then it was called Har
Anu, which translates roughly

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:90%
as the enclosure of Anu.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:90%
But who was Anu?

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.950 align:middle line:84%
In Mesopotamian tradition,
a scribe by the name

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Enmed Ur Annu wrote
down his encounters

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:10.730 align:middle line:84%
with people of his
lineage, the lords of Anu.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
The accounts took place hundreds
of years before the flood.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.930 align:middle line:84%
These antediluvian
gods were known

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:21.310 align:middle line:90%
as Anunaki, the people of Anu.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In India, they were
also known as Anu-nage,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.275 align:middle line:90%
the people of the serpent.

00:50:26.275 --> 00:50:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The scribe's name was likely
changed by the Hebrews

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to Enoch.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.930 align:middle line:84%
He describes the
Anunaki as having

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.420 align:middle line:84%
unusually white
skin, which seems

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to have been sensitive
to the sunlight,

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:84%
because they're often
applying oil to it,

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.370 align:middle line:84%
giving their skin a
shining appearance, hence

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:90%
the nickname, Shining Ones.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But the nickname also
defines their status

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.540 align:middle line:90%
as enlightened people.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, the Anunaki
are the same gods as Viracocha

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and his Shining
Ones in the Andes,

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:84%
the same as the Kanuul
of Central America,

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:84%
the Offiusa of
Portugal, the Urukehu

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.070 align:middle line:84%
of Easter Island and New
Zealand, and, of course,

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.930 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian Shining Ones,
the followers of Horus.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And this incredible
string of dots

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.100 align:middle line:84%
continues with the
gods who assisted

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.640 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi escape their
sinking land in the Pacific

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.260 align:middle line:90%
during the flood.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And they called them
the red ant people.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And the phrase comes
from the two Hopi words

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:31.990 align:middle line:84%
for ants and reddish
sand, Anu and Naki.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at one
international group of sages,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.310 align:middle line:84%
human like and yet
not entirely human,

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:84%
whose seafaring
skills enabled them

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.860 align:middle line:84%
to move from home to
home across the oceans

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:49.720 align:middle line:84%
as easily as you and I
go to the supermarket.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.320 align:middle line:84%
which may explain why there
is so much Egyptian vocabulary

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:90%
throughout Polynesia.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, an island
in Fiji called Raiatea,

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:03.200 align:middle line:90%
the white skinned people of Ra.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Solomon Islands, there
is Isatabu, the restricted,

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.880 align:middle line:90%
sacred abode of Isis.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And, of course,
while there exist

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:10%
identical megalithic
building techniques,

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:10%
stretching like an
umbilical cord from Egypt

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.575 align:middle line:10%
through the Central Pacific,
and all the way to the Andes.

00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:10%
But what of the lords of Anu?

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, these gods oversaw
seven groups of seven lords.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.690 align:middle line:84%
They were referred
to as Apkallu, sages.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And their nickname was watchers.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the watchers were demonized
in biblical texts purely

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.680 align:middle line:90%
for political reasons.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:10%
But in the original
story, they are largely

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:10%
seen as helpers of
humanity, a fact

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.510 align:middle line:10%
acknowledged by Native
American cultures

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:10%
who called them
lookers, messengers

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:10%
who were instrumental in
helping the Hopi escape

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:10%
their sunken Pacific island
after the Great Flood

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:10%
back in the days when they
were called Hisat-Sinom,

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:10%
or as we know them, Anasazi.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Throughout Mesopotamia,
the watchers

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.640 align:middle line:84%
were depicted by
figurines called

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Mezre, which were placed at
the corners of sacred buildings

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.330 align:middle line:90%
to ward off evil spirits.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The name means watchers
and awakened ones,

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor indicating their
qualities as guardians as well

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:90%
as enlightened people.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It stands to reason that
if the watchers were even

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
being used as talismans to
protect buildings from harm,

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.610 align:middle line:84%
they would hardly have been
evil people as the Bible would

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:90%
have us believe.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.300 align:middle line:84%
The lords of Anu
and the watchers

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.850 align:middle line:84%
were distinguishable
from humans insofar

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.120 align:middle line:84%
as they possessed knowledge
of the mechanics of nature,

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and how to manipulate it.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Thus, they were
compared to gods.

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was also the
view of the Egyptians, who

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:01.050 align:middle line:84%
referred to them both as
Urshu, which means watchers,

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and Neterw, a force
of nature, a god.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to their shining
skin, they were also very tall.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Mesopotamian tradition hints
that the flood gods lived

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:90%
in seven secluded locations.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So far in this program
we have identified

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Atitlan, Lapukije, also
known as Mu and Lemuria,

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Kainga Nui in the Pacific, the
birthplace of the gods in New

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Zealand, and Titicaca.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The assembly of the
lords of Anu itself

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is said to have been on a
high mountain called Ardis,

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:84%
speculated to have existed in
the region between the Black

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.860 align:middle line:90%
and Caspian Seas.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The lords of Anu, these
people of the serpent,

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they were said to live in
a compound called Garsuag,

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's never been
properly located.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.830 align:middle line:84%
That is, until I
met the last wisdom

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.190 align:middle line:84%
keeper from a hard to
find island in the Pacific

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:04.050 align:middle line:84%
called Tongareva, one
of the Cook Islands.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And he shared with me
his peoples' tradition

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that a group of gods
arrived from the Middle East

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.500 align:middle line:90%
around 3,000 BC.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They were said to be great
sages, star navigators,

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and intelligent people, red
haired, fair skinned, shining

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:22.360 align:middle line:84%
people who belonged to a very
ancient lineage of wisdom

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
keepers called Tuanake,
better known to us as Anunaki.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the wisdom
keeper also told me

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.920 align:middle line:84%
this group were present
throughout the Pacific

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.890 align:middle line:84%
far earlier, around the
time of the global flood.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Specifically on Easter Island
and one sacred platform

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.590 align:middle line:84%
there still carries their name,
Ahu Hananakou Interestingly,

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Ahu is a variant of
the Egyptian Aku,

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:84%
as in Aku Shemsu Hor,
the Shining Ones,

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.890 align:middle line:90%
the followers of Horus.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But Tongarevan
tradition further states

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that the original homeland
of the lords of Anu

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.720 align:middle line:84%
was an island nation
in the Indian Ocean

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.470 align:middle line:90%
by the name Te Petaka.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:10%
It is described as a
secluded, circular island,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.620 align:middle line:10%
which sank during a great
cataclysm 11,000 years ago.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And the region
around it was totally

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.160 align:middle line:84%
transformed to the point
where the island is

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:19.120 align:middle line:84%
no longer visible, because when
parts of the Indian Ocean sank,

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.440 align:middle line:90%
others rose.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So this missing land of the gods
existed in the general region

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:26.430 align:middle line:84%
where today stands
the Arabian Peninsula.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, this is
the same general location

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:84%
of the homeland of the gods
alluded to by the Egyptians,

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.740 align:middle line:90%
an island of fire.

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere in this region
is another missing homeland

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Shining Ones, the
people of the serpent,

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Anunaki, watchers,
Viracochas, and so on.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Two pieces of
circumstantial evidence

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:84%
point to these flood gods,
these master seafarers

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and astronomers who once lived
on this island, who set out

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to hand humanity the
art of civilization

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:11.010 align:middle line:84%
after the world was turned
upside down 11,000 years ago.

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The first is a
monument in Abu Dhabi.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It is totally out of
character for the region.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But a visitor from
the Andes would

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.910 align:middle line:84%
look at its style
of construction

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and believe they were still
back home, or Egypt, or Easter

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Island, for that matter.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The other piece of
evidence is papyrus 1115.

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Papyrus 1115 describes
the voyage of a sailor

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:84%
down the Red Sea and
into the Indian Ocean.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And the ship is
caught in a storm.

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.310 align:middle line:10%
All hands perish,
except the narrator,

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.920 align:middle line:10%
of course, who is shipwrecked
on what he believes

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:10%
to be a deserted island.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually he
meets the leader

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.670 align:middle line:84%
of the island, who gives
him food and a boat

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and returns him home to Egypt.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is not known when
this account took place.

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It is extremely old,
thousands of years old.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:04.730 align:middle line:84%
However, as he
embarks, the leader

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.880 align:middle line:84%
tells the sailor, this
will be the last time he'll

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.150 align:middle line:84%
see the island, because
soon it will vanish,

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:14.690 align:middle line:84%
consumed by a
rising of the ocean.

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.640 align:middle line:84%
The sailor then
offers a description

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of the unusual person
who ruled this island,

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:25.290 align:middle line:84%
a serpent with deep
blue eyes and a beard.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems this ancient
mariner is giving us

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:84%
a glimpse of one of
the many flood gods who

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:33.540 align:middle line:84%
went by the title people of
the serpent, not to mention one

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:84%
of the missing lands where
these helpers of humanity

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:41.970 align:middle line:84%
once held a great and memorable
civilization before teaching us

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:43.110 align:middle line:90%
how to create our own.

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea that we suddenly
discovered the accouterments

00:58:54.780 --> 00:59:00.000 align:middle line:84%
of civilization around 8,000
BC doesn't seem so far-fetched.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:45.000 align:middle line:90%
