00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:23.856 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm Peter Russell,
and all my life

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated by
science and the discoveries

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:90%
it's making about the world.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that science
hasn't been able to explain

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
is the very fact that
we are conscious,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that we each have an
inner world of experience.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to explain how
life evolved from simple cells

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
into human beings than it
is to explain why any of us

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
ever has a single
conscious thought.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet the very fact
that we are conscious,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
is the one thing we cannot deny.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the great
mystery of consciousness.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.915 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have this capacity
for inner experience?

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just human
beings that have it.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I often hear scientists say
that animals aren't conscious,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
but is that really so?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When I see a dog lying
on the floor asleep

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and its legs are twitching
and its nose is quivering,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I imagine it's dreaming.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And if it's dreaming, it
is having an experience.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And also, why else would
we bother giving our pets

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.864 align:middle line:84%
anesthetics when we
operate if we didn't

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
believe they were conscious?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Why would we want to
make them unconscious?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.535 align:middle line:84%
The difference with human beings
is that we know that we know.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We are conscious that
we are conscious.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
Now one way of thinking
about consciousness

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
is to liken it to the light
inside a film projector.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
At the heart of the projector,
a source of white light.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And the light shines
through the film

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and takes on the colors
and forms of the film,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and then an image
appears on the screen.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And what we're actually
seeing is just shaped light.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But we get so engrossed
in the movie, the stories,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
the feelings we're
having-- the sadness,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the horror, the excitement--
that we forget it's all just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
a form that light has taken on.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
A similar process
happens in the mind.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.955 align:middle line:84%
All I ever actually
experience are the images

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:49.205 align:middle line:90%
appearing in my consciousness.

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:52.096 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't seem that way.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
When I see a tree,
it looks as if I'm

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
seeing the tree directly,
but science tells me

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
something completely
different is happening.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Light enters the eye where
it's absorbed by the retina,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and it triggers electrical
impulses which travel down

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:90%
neural fibers to the brain.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The brain then analyzes
the data, and from that,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
creates its own
picture of the world.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I then have the experience
of seeing a tree.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
What I'm actually seeing
is not the tree itself,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but the image of a tree
that appears in my mind.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of
everything I experience.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Every sound, color, sensation,
taste, smell, memory,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
thought-- they're all just
images appearing in my mind.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's all forms the
consciousness is taking on.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But where does consciousness
itself come from?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the great mystery.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It may be that one day we'll
understand the brain so well,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that we know the exact
physical processes that

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
go on when we have the
experience of seeing a tree.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But even when we
do, the question

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
still remains of, why
is there consciousness

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't all this brain
activity go on in the dark?

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
This is what philosophers
call the hard problem

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
How is it that
something as unconscious

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
as the matter of the brain can
ever give rise to something

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:90%
as immaterial as an experience?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not
actually a hard problem,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
so much as an
impossible problem.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.196 align:middle line:84%
Impossible within
the current paradigm.

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:51.598 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:55.273 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, we're like
the medieval astronomers who

00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:57.106 align:middle line:84%
were locked into the
view that the earth was

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:59.305 align:middle line:84%
the center of the universe
with the sun, moon,

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:01.542 align:middle line:90%
and stars orbiting around it.

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
problem with this view.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.009 align:middle line:84%
The planets did not move
smoothly through the sky.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They wandered back and forth
amongst the other stars.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
The medieval astronomers
tried to explain

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
the peculiar movement
of the planets

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
with increasingly complex
systems of orbits,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
but nothing seemed to work.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.589 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.074 align:middle line:84%
When Copernicus came
along and suggested

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.062 align:middle line:84%
the earth might be
spinning around the sun,

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
no one took him seriously.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.434 align:middle line:84%
And when Galileo found
evidence to support Copernicus,

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:34.517 align:middle line:84%
the bishops refused to
look through his telescope,

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:37.002 align:middle line:90%
knowing it could not be true.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It was only a
hundred years later

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.978 align:middle line:84%
when Sir Isaac
Newton did the math

00:05:40.978 --> 00:05:44.208 align:middle line:84%
and proved the new view was
correct, that the paradigm was

00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:45.948 align:middle line:90%
finally established.

00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're in a
similar position

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:90%
regarding consciousness.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.575 align:middle line:84%
We are locked into the view that
consciousness itself is somehow

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
created by the brain, and
people have tried various ways

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:90%
to explain this.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Something to do with the
processing over the brain

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, something to do with
quantum effects inside nerve

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But try as they may,
no one has succeeded

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
in explaining how any purely
material process could ever

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.362 align:middle line:84%
give rise to an
experience in the mind.

00:06:12.362 --> 00:06:14.111 align:middle line:84%
We're rather like the
medieval astronomers

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
who never questioned
their basic assumptions.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.125 align:middle line:84%
And what is our basic
assumption today?

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It is that matter
is not conscious,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that matter is totally devoid
of the capacity for experience.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
An alternative
assumption, and one

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that's being taken seriously
by a growing number of people,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
is that the capacity
for experience

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is present to some
degree in everything.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Awareness itself isn't something
that is created by the brain.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't suddenly appear,
as if by magic, out of nowhere

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
once a particular arrangement of
the nervous system has evolved.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The capacity for experience
is there all along.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Now this isn't actually
such a new idea.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We find it's a common theme
in Eastern philosophy.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Many Western philosophers
have explored it,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's never been taken
seriously by Western science.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we
do take it seriously?

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It turns out it doesn't really
change anything in science.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Mathematics is still the same.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The laws of physics
all hold true.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Chemistry, biology--
everything we've

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:90%
discovered there is the same.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
What it changes is
our view of ourselves

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and our place in the cosmos.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It puts consciousness right
back at the center of things.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
In this view,
consciousness is not

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
limited to creatures
with nervous systems.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Even a simple bacterium has
a faint glimmer of awareness.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like the rich
experience we know.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like a
thought or a feeling,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
perhaps just the faintest
sense of warmth or light.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
If numbers could be
put to it, maybe a

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
billionth of human
consciousness, but not nothing

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
As life became
more complex, also

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
it's experience of the
world became more complex.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
When it developed
sensory systems,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
it was able to take in more
information from the world.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And then later as it
developed nervous systems,

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.117 align:middle line:84%
it was able to process
that information

00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and get a better picture
of the world around

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
so the image that
appeared in consciousness

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
got richer and more detailed.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, with human
beings, evolution

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:90%
took another step forward.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we not
only see the world

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and hear the world in all
its incredible detail,

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
we can also think
about our experience.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:90%
We can reflect upon it.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
And we can also then begin
to reflect upon ourselves

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that
we are experiencing,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and we notice that
we are conscious.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
We become conscious of
consciousness itself,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is the next great
step that we've made.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We have made the step
into self-awareness.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
With self-awareness
came a sense of a self,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:90%
of an I that is aware.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:90%
But what exactly is the self?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
This feeling of I that
we all know so well?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the second great
mystery of consciousness.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We use the word I
so much, you'd think

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
we knew what we meant by it.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you try to
define this thing we call I,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:90%
you run into problems.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:90%
How do I define myself?

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.905 align:middle line:90%
Peter Russell?

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:41.892 align:middle line:90%
That's just my name.

00:09:41.892 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
A writer?

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.676 align:middle line:90%
That's an activity from my past.

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:90%
A man?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I have a male body, but
I can imagine myself

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
in a female body.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I might have different
perceptions, feelings,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and values, but the I that
has them would be the same.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that same sense of I that
has been there all my life.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
What is this I that
is always there?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:84%
To know what the
self really is, we

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.102 align:middle line:84%
need to carefully observe
our own consciousness.

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:19.935 align:middle line:84%
This is the path that
many spiritual seekers

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:90%
have explored.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They've looked deep
within their own mind,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the
essence of self,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and they all come
up the same answer.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%
No thing we can call the self.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
This sense of a unique,
separate, individual self,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:90%
turns out to be an illusion.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Albeit, a very
convincing illusion.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:84%
This feeling we call I is just
the feeling of being conscious.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Many experience it as
simply a sense of being.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:58.978 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.978 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But because we don't normally
recognize that what we are

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is this inner
quality of being, we

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
keep looking for something
we can call the self.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we dress
ourselves up in all

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
these psychological clothes--
things like the roles

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
we play in life, the way people
see us, the things we do,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
our personality, our character.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But these are all
images of the self.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.345 align:middle line:84%
They're not the self
in its true essence.

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the opposite of
the emperor having no clothes.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.017 align:middle line:84%
In this case, there's
lots of clothes,

00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:90%
but no emperor underneath.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
If we imagine ourselves
to the various ideas

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
we have of the self, then
our sense of identity

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.655 align:middle line:84%
is always at the mercy
of events in the world.

00:11:40.655 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
If our circumstances
change, if our roles change,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
if the way people
see us changes,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
then our very sense of
identity can be thrown.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:84%
As a result of this, we spend
a lot of time and energy

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to fend off
threats to our identity,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to bolster
our self-image,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
buying things we don't really
need, trying to be someone.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, when
we discover what we really

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
are, when we discover this sense
of being that's always there

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
underneath, there comes
a sense of liberation--

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is the realization that we don't
need to do anything in order

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
to be anybody.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
With that, the mind relaxes.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
There's a sense of deep relief.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Underlying everything
we do in life,

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
everything we're looking for,
everything we're chasing,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
there's one common desire,
one universal purpose.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:90%
That is, we want to feel better.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We want to feel more satisfied,
more fulfilled, more at ease.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
None of us wants to be
in pain or suffering.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:90%
We want to avoid that if we can.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We all want to feel happy,
and have more joy in life.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
What this ultimately means
is that what we're really

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:84%
looking for is not things so
much as a better state of mind,

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
more satisfying state
of consciousness.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the mind's bottom line.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
As the Dalai Lama put it,
"In the final analysis,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.551 align:middle line:84%
the hope of every person
is simply peace of mind."

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:43.884 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with this.

00:13:43.884 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It's completely natural.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Where we go wrong
is in the ways we

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.805 align:middle line:90%
go about finding peace of mind.

00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome to Beverly Hills.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:90%
You have arrived.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>So we chase after wealth,
possession, fashion and fame,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
in the hope that if we just got
enough, we'd finally be happy.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we do find
what we're looking for,

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and we do feel happy again.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.607 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a
happiness which lasts,

00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
so we start looking
for something else

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to make us feel better.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of us spend our
whole lives just looking.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Yet the truth is, it isn't
having the right things

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:84%
or experiences that
makes us happy.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When we examine
our minds closely,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
we find the very opposite.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
When we think there's
something missing, something

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
we need in order to be happy,
we create for ourselves

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:90%
a feeling of discontent.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:84%
This, I often think, is the
sad joke about human beings.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
We're so busy worrying
about whether or not

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be at
peace in the future,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:84%
we never allow ourselves to be
at peace in the present moment.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
How can we be more
in the present?

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:90%
In itself, it's quite simple.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
relaxing the attention,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and opening our awareness
to what we're actually

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:90%
experiencing.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Just noticing the
actual sensations

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in your body-- flowing of the
breath, feeling in the hand.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.764 align:middle line:84%
Just noticing what is, as it
is, without thinking about it.

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Our experience of the body is
always in the present moment.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It's our thinking about it that
takes us out of the present.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The mind's been so deeply
ingrained to think about what's

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:84%
going on, that very easily
it jumps in and off again

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:90%
on some train of thought.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
When you realize
that has happened,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
just simply relax the
attention again, and once more

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
become aware of what
is actually happening

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:90%
The practice itself is simple.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Like any other
practice, it's just

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.932 align:middle line:84%
a matter of repeating the
process again and again.

00:16:08.932 --> 00:16:10.896 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, it gets
easier and easier.

00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The world's spiritual
traditions appear on the surface

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
to be very different.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:84%
They have different views
on the origin of life,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
or our place in the universe, or
what happens to us when we die.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Some believe in a supreme being.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Some believe in many deities.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Others don't talk of God
at all, but they do have

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.039 align:middle line:90%
some common underlying themes.

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They all see that we get caught
in attitudes and beliefs that

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
don't serve us well, that
lead us to behave in ways that

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
are harmful to
others, and often, not

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:90%
even in our own best interests.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Each spiritual tradition
seeks, in its own way--

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
some through prayer,
meditation, and devotion--

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to open to the inner
world of the mind,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:90%
the world of the spirit.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.084 align:middle line:84%
They want to liberate
our souls, to free

00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
our minds from self-centered
attitudes and materialist

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.372 align:middle line:90%
attachments.

00:17:17.372 --> 00:17:22.094 align:middle line:84%
They are urging us to discover
who and what we really are.

00:17:22.094 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
In one way or another,
they are talking

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:90%
about a shift in consciousness.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Consider what happens
when we find ourselves

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:90%
stuck in a traffic jam.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The traffic jam only has the
power to stop the traffic.

It does not inject adrenaline
into your bloodstream.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling upset, it's
because the voice in your head

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is telling you that you're going
to be late, and if you're late,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
bad things may happen.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.321 align:middle line:90%
You may miss the meeting.

00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:90%
You may be late home.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
It's this that's
making you upset,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the fear that you will not be
happy sometime in the future.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Western science
has been remarkably

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
successful at explaining
the world around us,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:90%
but it hasn't given us meaning.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The world it describes
is a dry, material world

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:90%
without any real purpose.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And science has also given us an
abundance of technologies which

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
we've used to satisfy many
of our needs and desires,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
but again, it hasn't
given us values.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tell us
the best way to use

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
knowledge and power.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It also hasn't really
helped us develop inwardly.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it's
reinforced that sense

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:90%
of self-centeredness.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
We're probably more
full of ourselves today

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever been.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I think what we need
today is an integration

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of our scientific
understanding of the world

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom that's
held in the world's

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
The origins of consciousness
may remain a mystery,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
but how to awaken our
consciousness, how

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to free ourselves from
misguided attitudes and values,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
to discover who and
what we really are,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:90%
that is not a mystery.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
That something that's been
explored by spiritual teachers

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
from around the
world-- people who've

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
got deep within their
own minds and discovered

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the true nature
of consciousness--

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and from that, how to live with
joy and love in their hearts.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need today.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We need to rediscover
that wisdom for ourselves.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:84%
The next great frontier
is not outer space.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It's inner space, research into
the nature of consciousness

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.991 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:19:53.991 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The one thing we all know for
sure, and the one thing we've

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:90%
not yet explored.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%
