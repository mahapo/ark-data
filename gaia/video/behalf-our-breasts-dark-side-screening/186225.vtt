everywhere should understand.

At the same time,
these experiences

of cancer treatment.

I mean, the truth is
that our practices

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:84%

have tremendous influence

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So ironically, looking
hard for cancer

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is a recipe for a
cancer epidemic.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And it has allowed us
to sort of understand

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that there's a vast
reservoir of abnormality

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:90%
in the human population.

We just all have abnormalities.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The breast is a gland,
like the thyroid,

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
like the prostate, that is
turning over cells a lot.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what glands do.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And so their cellular
abnormalities are not rare.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.000 align:middle line:90%
They're common.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%

clinical disease.

In Copenhagen in the 1980s,
pathologist Maya Nielsen

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:84%
had the idea to autopsy the
breasts of around 100 women

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
who had not been diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
they had in common

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
was that they had
all died unexpectedly

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.514 align:middle line:84%
from criminal or
accidental causes.

00:34:13.514 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:84%
When she examined their
cellular breast tissue

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
under the microscope,
she found something

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:90%
she was not expecting.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In her sample of dead
women, the pathologist

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
thought she would
discover that 6% of them

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.520 align:middle line:84%
had breast cancer, believed
to be the normal incidence

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:90%
in the population.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
However, she found
the figure was

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:48.415 align:middle line:84%
closer to 20%, three
times what she expected.

00:34:48.415 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This would suggest
that there are

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
numerous occurrences
of what we call cancer

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:90%
that are never diagnosed.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Maya Nielsen had just proved the
existence of dormant cancers.

understand is we're going to be

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:84%
treating people who have
these indolent cancers.

screening that mainly
reveals dormant cancers.

The phenomenon involves
precancerous lesions, but also

both sides of the story and
let them make a choice so they

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%

and a half of mammagraphically
detected cancers,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%

represent overdiagnosis.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds like a lot.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is the basic
truth about screening.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to involve literally
thousands to help a few.

And one of the questions
I've been raising

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have
a situation where

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you have to involve
1,000 people,

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:84%
potentially, to help one,
what happens to the other 999?

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important thing
for health care to be aware of.

raising the alarm.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:84%
His studies were published in
two prestigious publications,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:84%
"The Lancet" and "The New
England Journal of Medicine."

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.830 align:middle line:90%

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
"The New York Times" and "Le

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Overdiagnosed cancers?

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:84%
They would never have been
found without screening.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So these women are healthy.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you treat healthy women
with radiotherapy, for example,

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.720 align:middle line:90%
then you kill some of them.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they develop
heart disease or lung

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:90%
cancer or other cancers.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And these additional deaths
in healthy women amount

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to at least as many deaths
as what mammography screening

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
can prevent in terms of
breast cancer deaths.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear to me that there
is absolutely no survival

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:90%
benefit by going to screening.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Screening is
unequivocally harmful.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no survival benefit.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.140 align:middle line:90%

>> Peter Gotzsche had reanalyzed
the initial studies in detail,

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:51.120 align:middle line:84%
the ones carried out during the
1970s which predicted 30% more

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.440 align:middle line:84%
deaths from breast
cancer amongst women who

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:90%

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Gotzsche, these studies

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.140 align:middle line:90%
contained irregularities.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:09.670 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.030 align:middle line:84%
The first was that certain
women were excluded

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.550 align:middle line:84%
from the group that underwent
screening because they

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:90%
had a history of breast cancer.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But no such exclusion
was made among the group

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.990 align:middle line:90%
that did not undergo screening.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, this would
increase the mortality rate.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.360 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
The second was that
the causes of death

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.880 align:middle line:84%
were sometimes
difficult to determine.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Among the group that
was not screened,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.080 align:middle line:84%
deaths where the
cause was uncertain

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.180 align:middle line:84%
were attributed
to breast cancer,

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
again, increasing the breast
cancer mortality rate.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, in the study that
was the most favorable in terms

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.600 align:middle line:84%
of screening, the man
running the trials

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:84%
owned a private company
involved in mammograms.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And all public breast
cancer screening programs

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:84%
were set up because of a
belief in those studies.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:90%

>>INTERPRETER: For the moment,
France's health authorities

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:84%
has a position that for
any medical intervention,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:90%
there are benefits and risks.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And those benefits
should outweigh the risk.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:84%
In general, breast
cancer screening

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:84%
reduces the mortality
rates by around 20%.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a tricky and
emotional subject.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that, if you ask
me again in five years' time,

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the same thing
as I'm saying today.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially given that breast
cancer screening has yet to be

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:90%
fully understood.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.420 align:middle line:84%
In Birmingham in
the UK, one doctor

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.970 align:middle line:84%
is carrying out some
unusual experiments

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that may revolutionize
medical practices.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:84%
He believes that
precancerous lesions,

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or carcinomas in situ,
detected by chance,

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.890 align:middle line:84%
should not be
systematically removed.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Ductal carcinoma in
situ is not one disease.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a spectrum of diseases.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And we call them low,
intermediate, or high grade

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:12.412 align:middle line:90%
DCIS.

00:50:12.412 --> 00:50:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're interested
in finding out

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:18.190 align:middle line:84%
whether low, or some of the
intermediate grade DCIS,

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
really need to have
surgical treatment or not.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So then, the patients
will be randomized

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to either have surgery
as they would normally--

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.230 align:middle line:84%
so half the patients go through
the normal treatment pathway.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But half the patients,
instead of going immediately

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to surgery, would be observed
with mammograms performed

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:90%
every year for 10 years.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would be very surprised
to find that there's a survival

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.400 align:middle line:90%
difference.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.075 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very safe
trial for patients to go into.

00:50:47.075 --> 00:50:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And that what we end
up doing is seeing

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that patients can delay
their surgery safely

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.085 align:middle line:84%
without any detriment to
their overall survival.

and 35 radiotherapy sessions.

Nobody can say
whether or not she

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.270 align:middle line:84%
