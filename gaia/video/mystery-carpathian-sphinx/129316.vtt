the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I had to solve the mystery.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Could the Carpathian
Mountains and the Sphinx

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
have a central
yet forgotten role

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world?

for my work on the Sphinx.

I'm only going to mention
that very briefly, because I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:90%
sort of feel like I have to.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because in many ways, it does
set the stage for what we're

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
here about at this conference,
conference on procession,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
ancient knowledge, and really
pushing things way back.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
And this work that goes
back almost two decades

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
now for myself personally really
set the stage for much of what

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.559 align:middle line:90%
has come later.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not claiming
any credit here.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving credit to the Sphinx.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's also changed my life.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think-- usually
I think for the better.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I wonder
what I got myself into.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.085 align:middle line:10%
So I really started
on the Sphinx work

00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:40.001 align:middle line:10%
when I was very young.

This is me about 20 years ago.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:10%
And what it really
is indicated doing,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:10%
at least for some
people-- and this

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:10%
was part of the controversy,
and part of why we're here now--

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:10%
is talking about if you push
the date the Sphinx back,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:10%
does it mean that we have
to view history differently?

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Do we have to rewrite history?

from Boston University,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:90%
is an expert in ancient stone.

He had studied the Egyptian
Sphinx for many decades,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and he believes that
the Egyptian Sphinx

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is much older than traditionally
believed, dating back

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years before

Parts of the Sphinx itself,
if you look at to this day,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:90%
it's been heavily repaired.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of those repairs go
back 4,000 and more years,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because it was a much
more ancient statue.

Daniel Ruzo, a
Peruvian archaeologist

and protohistorian
from Peru, has

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
come to believe
that there once had

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.620 align:middle line:84%
been a great worldwide
civilization that had

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:90%
been destroyed in a cataclysm.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.259 align:middle line:84%

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Ruzo found proof in
England in such monuments

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:10%
as the Stonehenge, in
France in Fontainebleau.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:10%
Wherever he looked,
he found proof.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
He became aware that the
civilization was especially

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
a mountain
civilization that lived

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
on the high peak
of the mountains

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:90%
in all the continents.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1954, Ruzo discovered
Marcahuasi, a small plateau

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.238 align:middle line:84%
high atop the Andes
mountains in Peru.

00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Marcahuasi, up to this

He called this one the
Monument to Humanity.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo believed that the
Monument to Humanity

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most important
sculptures ever made.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:10%
In 1968, Ruzo came to
the Carpathian Mountains

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:10%
in Romania.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Here, Ruzo found the proof
that he was searching for.

Everywhere he looked
on the Bucegi Massif

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:10%
in the Carpathian
Mountains, he found proof

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:10%
of a very ancient culture.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:10%
He believed here was the door to
the treasure of a lost people.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Ruzo believed that the
treasure is not a material

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:10%
one, but a spiritual treasure.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:10%
Ruzo investigated the area
around the Carpathian Sphinx,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:10%
and he found tantalizing proof
of this lost civilization

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:10%
here as well.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
"The Carpathian Sphinx
is an ancient monument

sculpted before the flood,
destroyed in the face,

and being very corroded
by wind and rain."

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo concluded that the
Carpathian Sphinx, just as

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the Monument of
Humanity in Marcahuasi,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
was the important
legacy of a lost people.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:10%
When he returned to
Peru, Ruzo published

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:10%
a book called "The Fantastic
History of a Discovery."

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, he wrote
about a trip to Romania.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
He dedicated a chapter to
what he saw in the Carpathian

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, and he said, "the
Romanian Carpathian Mountains

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
were at the center of the oldest
European civilization known

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
today."

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
His conclusions were made after
he saw the Carpathian Sphinx.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo died in 1991 before
he was able to find

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.798 align:middle line:84%
this worldwide
vanished civilization.

00:10:34.798 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.612 align:middle line:84%

road for later research.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo was confident
that he was right,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and that one day, someone
will clarify the mystery

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:10%
all over the world,
that has not been

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:10%
reproduced in historical times.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:10%
Being so used to a
three-dimensional landscape

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:10%
starting in Sumerian times,
we had failed until today

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:10%
to see the sculptures
considered made by nature."

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:10%
"The strangest
apparition on the plateau

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:10%
is the Sphinx, a huge rock
with an enigmatic profile

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:10%
around which a protohistorical
legend had been formed.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:10%
The legend says that a
sphinx is a statue made

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:10%
in times long forgotten by the
people of a lost civilization."

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Sort of U shape.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell this from down
at the base of the mountains.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.171 align:middle line:84%
It's really like a
fortress up there.

00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>From a distance, it looks
very abrupt, uninviting,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
with steep rocky areas that
are very hard to climb.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But the reality of the
mountain is actually

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
something different.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Interestingly, once you get up
there, you get the unexpected.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:90%
It opens up into a huge plateau.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>The Sphinx is at a central
point on the plateau.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Going south directly
from the Sphinx,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
there is a group
of enigmatic rocks

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
called The Peaks of Longing.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
From here, in direct line to the
north, one can see the Sphinx

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the highest
peak called Omu,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:90%
the Peak of the Human Being.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Something that's
very interesting

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
Sphinx in Romania,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at the plateau,
looking at the surrounding area

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is at high elevation, you have
these incredible structures.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
They can be seen before
from a very great distance.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They certainly seem like markers
or signposts, or something that

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
might attract ancient peoples.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is something
we have to take very seriously.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of the rocks on the
plateau have feminine names.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
This one is called
the Big Old Lady Rock.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
These ones are the old
ladies of Cocora Mountain.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the Mountain
of the Old Lady.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.537 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.537 --> 00:14:50.347 align:middle line:84%
The Ialomita Valley hides the
mountain called the Goddesses

00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:52.882 align:middle line:90%
Mountain.

00:14:52.882 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The highest peak in Bucegi,
facing the north direction,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
the Peak of the Human Being.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.584 align:middle line:84%
This mountain is called
the Origin or the Beginning

00:15:02.584 --> 00:15:03.384 align:middle line:90%
Mountain.

00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:10%
The main river flowing
down the valley

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.994 align:middle line:10%
below the Goddesses
Mountain was called Naparis,

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.918 align:middle line:10%
which means "Heavenly One."

00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:17.247 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
why are all these women

00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:21.634 align:middle line:84%
names in this mountain,
and the sacred names,

00:15:21.634 --> 00:15:25.716 align:middle line:84%
such as the Mountain of the
Goddesses and the mountain

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:90%
called Human Being?

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Could there have been here a
religious matriarchal society

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:10%
at one point in time?

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:10%
Could there have been a very
ancient feminine worship?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:10%
"The origin of these
names must be discovered

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:10%
as the myths as well
as the sculptures

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:10%
are before the
time of the flood."

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx has
multiple profiles, best

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
seen in the changing light.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Where do the orbits of
the Sphinx point to?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Why are there all these figures,
especially the ones looking

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:90%
west towards the setting sun?

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The profile that resembles
the Egyptian Sphinx

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.782 align:middle line:90%
is looking north.

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
The profile that resembles
an anthropoid face

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:90%
is looking west.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Why does one profile look
towards the north and another

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:90%
towards the west?

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
One to the northern
sky and the other one

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.425 align:middle line:90%
towards the setting sun?

00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:47.225 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And where is the
door to the treasure?

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Who is this spirited god?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Will I ever find out?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.934 align:middle line:84%
The enigmatic
faces are only seen

00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:90%
from certain points of view.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:11.474 align:middle line:84%
They are best seen with the
changing light, the shadows

00:17:11.474 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:90%
of the moon, and the sun.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
Will the sun point to
a secret direction?

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo believed these
monuments point

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.684 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred treasure
found in caves.

00:17:26.684 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And what is the mystery
of the gigantic rock

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:84%
resembling very much
a podium, a stage?

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Could this place have been used
for some type of performers,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
from some rituals of
a vanished humanity?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
A vast crowd could have been
in the valley, looking up

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
at somebody performing,
singing or dancing on the top.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the
door to the treasure?

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Could this relate back to
the Sphinx, to the caverns

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that Daniel Ruzo
was talking about?

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Could the spiritual treasure
Daniel Ruzo was talking

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:90%
about be found in these caves?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.906 align:middle line:84%
This cave is on the mountain
called Goddesses Mountain.

00:18:19.906 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Could there be any
choices here that would

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.716 align:middle line:90%
point to a lost civilization?

00:18:29.716 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Ruzo considered that only
an expert could find this door.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Where do I need to look
to find the answers?

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Could this be an ancient
religious center,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:90%
as Daniel Ruzo had concluded?

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a
spiritual treasure here?

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Some people think
the world of long ago

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:84%
contains a body
of great secrets,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
like some treasure trove of
insights that will unlock

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
the universe's hidden doors.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Or new undiscovered
technologies

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
they will free us
from drudgeries.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I doubt that such is the case.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
The gifts of the ancient
world go much deeper.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I think when we look for
this lost civilization,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
there may have been
lost civilizations,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
but they were not
necessarily what we expect

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
or what many people expect.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
That is, they were
not a mirror image

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
in the past of
what we are today.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:10%
>>"They lived around the
mountains and carved into them.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:10%
They appreciated
the natural beauty

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.321 align:middle line:10%
and had high mental abilities."

00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo called them "the guardians
of an ancient wisdom."

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:10%
"It was a magical work done
by a culture whose science

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:10%
and understanding of the world
was different from the present.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:10%
It was from these people
that we had inherited

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:10%
all our ancient wisdom,
our sense of religion

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:10%
The world we had today was the
legacy of a lost civilization.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:10%
All the symbolic systems,
all the legendary characters,

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:10%
all the myths and
the legends do not

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:10%
have the name of the author.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:10%
We have inherited them
from a vanished humanity."

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>If Daniel Ruzo was right about
an ancient lost civilization,

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:84%
was this ancient lost
civilization actually

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
what we would now
call Neanderthals?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So going back tens of thousands
of years into the last ice age.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Could the Neanderthals
be the anonymous authors

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%
of our legends and myths?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.346 align:middle line:90%
Of our ancient wisdom?

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Could the lost civilization
that Daniel Ruzo

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
had been searching
for his entire life

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
without finding be the extinct
Neanderthal civilization?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there any valid
evidence to support

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.352 align:middle line:90%
such an original hypothesis?

00:21:46.352 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Born in London to
working class parents

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and spending most of his
days in England and Wales,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
on the surface,
Stan Gooch's life

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
may not have seemed
particularly exciting.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.663 align:middle line:84%
But it was his remarkable
intellectual journey

00:22:07.663 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that distinguished
him as a person

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and where his legacy lies.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In relative
isolation, Stan Gooch

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
studied the elements of human
evolution and the human psyche,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.415 align:middle line:84%
and he came to an
astonishing conclusion.

00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>We are a hybrid species.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We are a cross-breed between
two very different types

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of early man, Neanderthal
and Cro-Magnon.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:10%
>>Gooch authored many books,
including "Total Man,"

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:10%
"Personality and Evolution,"
"The Neanderthal Question,"

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:10%
"Guardians of the
Ancient Wisdom,"

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:10%
and "The Double
Helix of the Mind."

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:10%
However, Gooch never
gained a popular audience,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:10%
critical acclaim, or
monetary remuneration

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:10%
that he had hoped for.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, Gooch became convinced
that the establishment

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:90%
was deliberately ignoring him.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
By the late 1980s,
he had all but

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
given up his
studies and writing,

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and went almost into
total seclusion.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
In the end, Gooch did
entertain the thought

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.272 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps after his
death, his contributions

00:23:31.272 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:90%
might be widely acknowledged.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Gooch was convinced
that the Neanderthals

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:90%
had been underestimated.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>For Stan Gooch, Neanderthals
were their own species.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:90%
They had their own culture.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
civilization even.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
He used terms like
cities of dreams,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that they built
cities of dreams.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:90%
They had a dream culture.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
They had an advanced,
sophisticated culture.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Gooch believed that the
ancient moon worship was

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:90%
possessed by the Neanderthals.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Neanderthal was,
in fact, nocturnal,

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
or at least semi-nocturnal
and worshipped the moon,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:84%
whereas Cro-Magnon was a
daylight creature, a hunter

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, and
worshipped the sun.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>The Neanderthals
lived in Europe

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
during the ice age for
at least 100,000 years.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:10%
Neanderthals' range
included all of Europe

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.785 align:middle line:10%
and parts of Asia, the
Middle East, and the Levant.

00:24:36.785 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:10%
During the time of the
Neanderthals in the Carpathian

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:10%
Mountains, there was
a high population

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:10%
of cave bears, one of the
biggest populations in Europe.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:10%
There is still a
puzzling mystery

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:10%
why Neanderthals went
extinct, but a number

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:10%
a possible scenarios have
been proposed by scientists,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:10%
ranging from natural
disasters, massive earthquakes,

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:10%
and catastrophic
volcanic eruptions

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.353 align:middle line:10%
in Europe, but also
human diseases.

00:25:12.353 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It is clear if the
Cro-Magnon massively

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.455 align:middle line:84%
eliminated Neanderthal
on purpose,

00:25:17.455 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:90%
or if they were already doomed.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to popular belief,
many Neanderthal populations

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
in Europe had light skin,
green eyes, and red hair.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Typically, people had
the concept of Neanderthals

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:10%
as being dark, brutish,
ape-like, if you would,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:10%
and the Cro-Magnons,
our ancestors,

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:10%
were the light-skinned,
fair-haired individuals.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:10%
May be totally opposite.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:10%
That in fact, the early
archaic Homo sapiens

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:10%
were much darker
than the Neanderthals

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:10%
that they came in
contact with in Europe.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:10%
Gooch predicted this long ago.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>>Neanderthals were much
stronger than modern humans.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:10%
The body type of a
Neanderthal can easily

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:10%
be compared to that of a modern
wrestler or body builder.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:10%
They were not delicate, nor what
we would consider beautiful.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But surprisingly, Neanderthals
were highly emotional

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and a very sensitive bunch.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
There is strong evidence
from their anatomy

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.950 align:middle line:84%
suggesting they had a very
well-developed vocal apparatus.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Powerful voices, perfect pitch,
and a more sensitive inner ear

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
than the one of
the modern human.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:10%
Steve Mithen, an
archaeologist from the UK,

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:10%
thinks Neanderthals were
the most musically developed

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:10%
human species that ever lived.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:10%
They were musically
inclined, amazing singers,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:10%
and they were great performers.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:10%
"The Neanderthals were
a nocturnal species,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:10%
and they worshipped the moon.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:10%
They came out at the night
and performed ceremonies

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:10%
for the moon goddess, especially
at full moon or new moon.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Anatomical evidence for
a nocturnal lifestyle

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
rests on the Neanderthals'
very large, round eye sockets,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and very large ear apertures.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Large eyes in particular
are the special hallmark

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
of a nocturnal creature.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:10%
The Neanderthals learned how
to not fear the darkness.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:10%
And in the process, they fell
in love with the night sky.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:10%
The Neanderthals worshiped
the northern sky.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:10%
They considered that the
still center of the heavens

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:10%
was in the north.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:10%
They worshipped the
northern constellations,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:10%
the constellation of the
little bear and the big bear."

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:84%
According to Stan Gooch,
the cave bear ritual

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Neanderthals
is the oldest ritual

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:84%
in the world performed
by a human species.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:10%
"The Neanderthal may have
been far more intelligent

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:10%
than we recognize.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthal man appeared to
know far more about the stars,

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
for example, than
one would suppose.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our general
picture of Neanderthal

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:90%
is obviously of a shambly ape.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And Stan argued that, in fact,
he knew an enormous amount

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
about the heavens, and
also about procession

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes, and about
all kinds of other things."

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Symbolic behavior was central
to the Neanderthal culture.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthals made advanced
stone tools, cook their meals,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:90%
and ate vegetables.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:10%
They wore jewelry
and body painting,

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:10%
had their own language
system, and lived

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:10%
in complex social groups.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They collected and preserved
crystals and minerals,

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and probably made figurines.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:10%
In Stan Gooch's
view, Neanderthals

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:10%
were culturally advanced people,
highly civilized in spirit

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:10%
with a deep sense of religion
and practiced herbal medicine.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:10%
"The Neanderthal society
was fully ruled by women.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:10%
They were the
ultimate authority.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:10%
The night and moon
ceremonies of Neanderthal

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:10%
were presided over
by priestesses."

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>We've got the sun, the
positive, and the moon,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
the negative, or whatever
you want to call them.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible, really.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
moon and the sun

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:84%
fascinate us so much, because
they reflect, as it were,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:90%
literally, our own duality.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:10%
>>"The Neanderthal society
was peaceful, compassionate,

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:10%
and loving to one another.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:10%
Central to their life was
religion and magical practices.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Neanderthals were what we
would call today magicians,

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.870 align:middle line:10%
also shamans, and also wizards.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.596 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.596 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:10%
Cro-Magnon's life was rooted in
the concept of male ownership.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:10%
This was a society
fully ruled by man.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a society who
worshipped the sun

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and lived for daylight."

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>They were about
hunting and producing

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:90%
weapons, things like that.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Cro-Magnon was
certainly superior.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.101 align:middle line:84%
But if you're talking
about knowledge of herbs,

00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:84%
then I would say
Neanderthal was superior.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
you're talking about.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>He was interested in
things like brain structure.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
He pointed out rightfully
that Neanderthals on average

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
had larger brains
than modern humans.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But these larger brains
were differently arranged,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
differently proportioned
than our modern humans.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, a very
important point of Gooch,

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:84%
one that he makes over and
over in his writings and books,

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is that Neanderthal brains
had larger cerebellums.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.220 align:middle line:84%
The brain of humans, be it
Neanderthal or modern humans,

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is composed of a cerebrum
and a cerebellum.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
The cerebellum is
sometimes referred to

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:84%
as the smaller brain,
the lesser brain.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:10%
It's essentially,
one could argue,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:10%
a separate brain housed inside
and underneath, anatomically,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the brain.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:10%
Gooch points out that
the cerebellum was larger

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.640 align:middle line:10%
in Neanderthals.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.790 align:middle line:84%
He attributes, and I believe
perhaps rightfully so,

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
based on clinical evidence,
that the cerebellum is really

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:84%
the seat of many
mental abilities,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
many mental processes
that we to this day

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
have a very poor
understanding of.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, dreams
may originate primarily

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:57.715 align:middle line:90%
in the cerebellum.

00:31:57.715 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Certain types of
artistic impulses,

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
religious impulses,
impulses of the sacred,

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
certain, we could call
it loosely philosophical

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and cyclical impulses.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>My view is that
Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:24.914 align:middle line:84%
cross-bred in central
Europe some 30,000,

00:32:24.914 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:90%
35,000, 40,000 years ago.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>When Neanderthal and
Cro-Magnon interbred,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Stan Gooch believes each side
made a unique contribution.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:84%
At one level, this was a
cultural cross-fertilization.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But at a deeper level, it
was a genetic encounter.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthal contributed
our religious genes,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:84%
while Cro-Magnon contributed
our scientific endowment.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.940 align:middle line:84%
A project to sequence
the Neanderthal genome

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:84%
took off in 2006 with
the participation

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Planck Institute
in Zurich, Switzerland,

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and the Broad Institute of
Harvard and MIT in Boston.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:84%
In May 2010, the genome project
revealed shocking results.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:10%
Interbreeding between
Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:10%
took place, resulting
from 1% to 4%

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:10%
of the current European
and Asian populations

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:10%
having Neanderthal genes.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:10%
>>"You have these two cultures
meeting, very different world

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:10%
views.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.850 align:middle line:10%
Essentially a duality.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:10%
The scientific on the
one hand, the religious

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:10%
on the other hand.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:10%
I can imagine the Cro-Magnons
studying the Neanderthals,

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:10%
perhaps surreptitiously at
first, trying to understand,"

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:10%
well, what are these
weird people doing?

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:10%
What is all this about?

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:10%
What are these strange
rituals and practices,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:10%
these ceremonies, this
dancing, this singing

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.230 align:middle line:10%
that they were observing?

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.980 align:middle line:10%
What this is all about?

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:10%
Cro-Magnons could
not necessarily

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:10%
understand what was going on.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:10%
They tried to figure
out what was going on,

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:10%
but it was very alien to them.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:26.406 align:middle line:10%
>>Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal
did not interbreed peacefully,

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:10%
in my opinion.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it was Cro-Magnon
raping Neanderthal woman.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:90%
That's how we arose.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it says in
the Old Testament, when

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.940 align:middle line:84%
the sons of God came into
the daughters of men,

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:84%
these were the
mighty men of old.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
Their offspring were
the mighty men of old.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.696 align:middle line:90%
Sons of God, Cro-Magnon, male.

00:34:47.696 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
Daughters of men were
her, female, Neanderthal.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It was Cro-Magnon raping
Neanderthal woman,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion, that produced us.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Our culture, our
religious impulses,

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
many of our
institutions, societal

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:84%
institutions are
really a combination

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of both Neanderthal institutions
or religious aspects, if you

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
want to call it that,
and Cro-Magnons,

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Cro-Magnons really
adopted or inherited,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
or actually took over
many Neanderthal concepts,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:84%
many Neanderthal
mental innovations.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:84%
For instance, maybe symbolism,
religious ceremonies.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of what, in a
most deep-seated way,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.180 align:middle line:84%
make up our culture, make up
our identity as we see it today.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of our culture and
our beliefs and our disbeliefs

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:90%
come from Neanderthal.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So we've incorporated much
of the Neanderthal material

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:90%
into our lives.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.745 align:middle line:84%
Now in particular-- I'm
picking on this in particular--

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I maintain that the story of
Christ and the Resurrection,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
all of it, is simply a distorted
version of the ancient moon

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:90%
religion.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Crucified on the cross.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.910 align:middle line:84%
The cross is the
symbol for the moon

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
in all pre-Christian
cultures worldwide.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:84%
He's crucified on a Friday,
which is Friars Day.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.240 align:middle line:90%
She's the moon goddess.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.663 align:middle line:84%
He's resurrected on Monday,
which is my Moon Day.

00:36:26.663 --> 00:36:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And he's resurrected three
days later, then he dies.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Now three is important for
several reasons in the moon

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
One, the moon has three
colors, white, red, and black.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.534 align:middle line:90%
So the moon has three colors.

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And what's more
important than that?

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, of course,
is that earth, moon, and sun

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:84%
are considered to be
mother, father, child.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And the earth is the child,
the daughter of the sun

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
and the moon.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
the moon religion.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So the three is important
for several reasons.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Christ is said to be born
of the 25th of December.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Now that's three
days-- did you say

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.770 align:middle line:84%
three-- three days after the
shortest day when the sun is

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
reborn every year after
the moon sacrifices him

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.430 align:middle line:90%
on the shortest day.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.960 align:middle line:84%
She sacrifices him,
and then resurrects him

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.250 align:middle line:90%
so that life can continue.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Could the story
of Jesus Christ

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:34.526 align:middle line:84%
be based upon a far older
story of Neanderthal rituals?

00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:37.224 align:middle line:84%
Could our most cherished
religious beliefs

00:37:37.224 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
originate with the Neanderthals,
such as the concepts

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.144 align:middle line:84%
we have of immortality
and resurrection?

00:37:45.144 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Could the Bible be an
actual historical source

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.956 align:middle line:84%
that had preserved some of the
Neanderthal fundamental wisdom,

00:37:53.956 --> 00:37:57.455 align:middle line:84%
preserving it for
us in a veiled form?

00:37:57.455 --> 00:38:05.375 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Ralph Solecki, an archaeologist
who worked at the Smithsonian

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:15.266 align:middle line:84%
Institution, went to do an
excavation in northern Iraq

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:90%
in a cave called Shanidar.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
What he discovered he
published in a book

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
called "Shanidar: The
First Flower People."

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:84%
In the cave of Shanidar,
Solecki discovered

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:35.010 align:middle line:84%
nine Neanderthal skeletons, the
most ever found in one cave.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:10%
During the excavations that
took many years to uncover,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Solecki discovered
something extraordinary

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:10%
that changed completely the
perception of Neanderthal up

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.732 align:middle line:10%
to that point.

00:38:48.732 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:90%
This was 1971.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:84%
What he discovered was
a burial with flowers.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The Neanderthals had
buried their dead

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:84%
with seasonal flowers that
also had medicinal purposes.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:84%
This was quite
shocking to discover,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.470 align:middle line:84%
the compassion of these
people and the fact

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that they believe
in an afterlife.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.640 align:middle line:84%
The flowers found
in the Shanidar cave

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.560 align:middle line:90%
are found in Bucegi.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a spring burial
with flowers that

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:90%
were white, violet, and yellow.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.940 align:middle line:84%
In his excavations, Solecki
discovered other things

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that changed our
perception of Neanderthal.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
He discovered the skeletons
of handicapped and old people,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:84%
so it meant that
the Neanderthal had

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to take care of their
sick and their old.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that such a human touch?

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Solecki called the
Neanderthals people

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:90%
with such good characters.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
We should be proud to have
them as our ancestors.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a far cry from
the view of Neanderthal

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:84%
held for most of this
century, that they were

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:90%
a brutal subspecies of humans.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
In light of recent
evidence, Neanderthal

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:84%
emerges shockingly
close to a modern human,

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:84%
a sensitive, highly
intelligent creature

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.161 align:middle line:84%
with a well-developed culture
and a well-developed sense

00:40:26.161 --> 00:40:26.961 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Like any good scientific
theory, Gooch's ideas

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
are subject to testing
and further exploration.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:10%
Two hours walking
distance from the Sphinx,

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:10%
there is a cave
called the Bear Cave,

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of cave bear
remains had been found here,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.444 align:middle line:10%
as well as Neanderthal tools
and two Neanderthal hearths.

00:41:02.444 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It is possible, I believe,
that the Neanderthals used

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:84%
this cave not only
for living, but they

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.175 align:middle line:90%
used it to perform rituals.

00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:10%
Daniel Ruzo considered
that everywhere else

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:10%
in the world, the legends
and the sculptures

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:10%
had been forgotten.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.512 align:middle line:84%
But here in the Carpathian
Mountains of Romania,

00:41:31.512 --> 00:41:34.160 align:middle line:84%
the legends keep
alive the memory.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.400 align:middle line:84%
A legend called the Ialomita
Cave, collected by the Romanian

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Queen Elizabeth, talks about an
old magician, an old wizard who

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
was isolated here, who
lived in seclusion,

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and who practiced
herbal medicine,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and who was very,
very knowledgeable.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Another legend talks
about Zalmoxis.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.050 align:middle line:10%
>>The cult of Zalmoxis.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:10%
This was recorded by the ancient
Greek historian Herodotus,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:10%
but clearly goes back to
much more ancient times.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it actually goes
back to Neanderthal times.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>And when he emerged, he was
designated "God of Immortality

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and of the Night."

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It was clearly a cult that
believed in immortality,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
beyond physical death.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:84%
There was something beyond
the material existence.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:84%
There was something
that we might

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:84%
call a soul that would
continue, that would survive.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:84%
This is actually not a belief
that the ancient Greeks,

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
for instance, had, but it
seems to have been a belief

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that the Neanderthals had.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>>The Bats Cave has not
been properly excavated

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:10%
since the 1950s when Neanderthal
remains had been found here.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:44:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The evidence in the
Carpathian Mountains

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.360 align:middle line:84%
shows that a
Neanderthal cave bear

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.816 align:middle line:84%
ritual is 75,000 years old,
the oldest in the world.

00:44:14.816 --> 00:44:24.504 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.504 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>It's important, in my mind,
to carry out new excavations,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040 align:middle line:84%
not looking for just
the same old, same old,

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:36.053 align:middle line:84%
but also looking for new
evidence with a new view,

00:44:36.053 --> 00:44:37.860 align:middle line:90%
with a new frame of mind.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
No flowers have
been found yet with

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.280 align:middle line:90%
any other prehistoric burials.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We offer the suggestion
here that up to this time,

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.672 align:middle line:84%
no one has looked
for the evidence.

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:10.378 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>In early August, I returned
to Bucharest to welcome a very

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.065 align:middle line:90%
special guest.

00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:28.855 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.855 --> 00:45:33.845 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:47.318 --> 00:45:48.316 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, we do.

00:45:48.316 --> 00:45:49.314 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:49.314 --> 00:45:52.807 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] where
they were excavating before.

00:45:52.807 --> 00:45:54.003 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, exactly.

00:45:54.003 --> 00:45:54.803 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:54.803 --> 00:45:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Very important, yes.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Even looking today, I found--
for instance, here's a tooth.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, wow.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>The remains of a tooth.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It looks to me like a--

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Pretty big.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Pretty big.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:90%
A bear, ancient bear.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:90%
You can see the root.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.860 align:middle line:90%
You can see the crown.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks to me
like a molar tooth.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But to just come in here, just
be looking for a few minutes,

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and to find it right
on the surface.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Also, there's not
only one type of ritual

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.500 align:middle line:90%
that they found with cave bears.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.600 align:middle line:84%
That there were
different formations,

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:90%
different arrangements.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So that implies
complexity of thinking.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Different rituals, maybe, for
different specific things.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are
variations on a theme.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:90%
So there's a continuity.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
But there's also the variations.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So it shows a real complexity.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So here you have a
connection, I think,

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.430 align:middle line:90%
at least anthropomorphic.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:23.480 align:middle line:10%
A human connection between
caves on the one hand

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:10%
and stone sculptures
on the other hand.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.580 align:middle line:10%
I find this absolutely amazing.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:10%
Everyone looks at one
side of the Sphinx

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:10%
and sees a face there.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.120 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a modern face.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.390 align:middle line:10%
But if we walk around to the
other side, look what we have.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a face.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>We have an anthropoid
looking face.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.456 align:middle line:10%
But it looks like a Neanderthal.

00:47:46.456 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:84%
A Neanderthal face with a
big eye socket, low forehead.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:10%
You can see the mouth
and the nose here.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And notice-- and I think this is
very telling, very important--

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.120 align:middle line:10%
the way it's facing.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.700 align:middle line:10%
This face is looking
toward the west.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.210 align:middle line:10%
And we're here in the evening.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.530 align:middle line:10%
The sun is setting.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:10.060 align:middle line:10%
Look how the sun is lined up.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:10%
>>Direct line to the eye.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:10%
>>Direct line to the eye.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:10%
This Neanderthal-type face
is looking toward the west,

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.100 align:middle line:10%
looking toward the setting sun.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.250 align:middle line:10%
Now it's been speculated
that Neanderthals

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.730 align:middle line:10%
were a more nocturnal species.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:10%
If that's the case, what sun
would they be interested in?

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:10%
The setting sun.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:10%
The sun that sets
as they come out

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:10%
for their nocturnal
activities, their ceremonies,

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.670 align:middle line:10%
their rituals.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.900 align:middle line:10%
So they would not be
looking toward the east

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.670 align:middle line:10%
as many modern cultures
do, but toward the west.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.840 align:middle line:10%
The setting sun, which would
be significant and important

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.200 align:middle line:10%
to them, because essentially,
that would start their day.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.710 align:middle line:10%
That would start
their ceremonies.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.520 align:middle line:10%
And here we have a
Neanderthal-like face

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.780 align:middle line:10%
looking toward the setting sun.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, looking at this
face as a geologist,

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:84%
looking at the types
of rock, you've

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:84%
got several different
layers of rock.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:90%
You've got more fine sandstones.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got conglomerates.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.110 align:middle line:84%
You've got rocks that
are set within the rock.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That's all natural.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, like that one.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Like these pink rocks and
these darker blackish rocks.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have what looks
like a little hat on top of it,

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.010 align:middle line:84%
which is a slightly
different rock,

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.930 align:middle line:90%
different lithology again.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a very complex
interplay of different rock

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.070 align:middle line:90%
types, and that's all natural.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Then you have them shaped
into this face, this profile.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I start to wonder,

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.650 align:middle line:84%
is that totally natural
erosional features,

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
or is there the
possibility that it

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
started to look
like a face because

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of natural erosional features?

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that maybe people
came, they pecked away at it,

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:13.180 align:middle line:84%
they modified it a little
bit to look more like a face?

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We know from other
places that does happen.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Now when I've walked around
this, looked at it closely,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:24.430 align:middle line:84%
it's so badly eroded that
it's, I would say, virtually

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:84%
impossible to tell at
this point if there's

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.310 align:middle line:90%
any kind of artificiality to it.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.490 align:middle line:90%
There could have been.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't say for certain.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think more importantly
in a way, it doesn't matter.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got this profile,
you've got this structure.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly recognizable as
a face, as a human profile.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.080 align:middle line:84%
When you walk around
to the other side,

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.090 align:middle line:84%
you've got another clearly
recognizable profile.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They're oriented in
important directions,

00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.300 align:middle line:84%
this one toward the north,
the other face that looks more

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Neanderthal toward the west.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
That's significant
in both cases.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So whether they're
natural or whether they're

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.090 align:middle line:84%
artificial or some
combination of both,

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I can see that they were
incredibly important.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.810 align:middle line:84%
They would have attracted
attention in ancient times

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.350 align:middle line:90%
just as they do now.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Many sacred sites around
the world are natural,

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and they're maybe even
considered more sacred

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.100 align:middle line:90%
because they are natural.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:90%
They're from nature.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.865 align:middle line:90%
They're from the gods.

00:51:30.865 --> 00:51:31.665 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:51:31.665 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:90%
So it looks like a miracle.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>The natural rock has a
shape of a face or an animal.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Without any--

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Any human touch,
any artificialities.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, one could argue
that if this is fully natural,

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:middle line:84%
it's even more spectacular,
even more important,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's an indication
of something that

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:84%
could be considered from
the gods' sacred divinity.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.710 align:middle line:84%
If this is completely
natural, I'm

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot more impressed
and moved than if it was

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.050 align:middle line:90%
sculpted by the hand of man.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>So I see this as a huge head.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But really, only the
upper portion of the head,

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.680 align:middle line:90%
what I call the emerging head.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it, this
to me looks like a nose.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
nose starting here.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a huge nose.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Huge nose.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.660 align:middle line:90%
You've got an eye socket here.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And then above the eye
socket, the brow ridge.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And then a low forehead.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is this forehead

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is not like a modern
forehead, but much lower.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:84%
The whole skull, the
whole head is pulled back,

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:50.530 align:middle line:84%
elongated toward
the back portion.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Which, to me, says this
is a Neanderthal head.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not a modern head,
but it's a Neanderthal head

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.290 align:middle line:84%
or a Neanderthal face
emerging from the bedrock.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Top of face.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's being
born from the bedrock.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And so not only do you have
this face sort or this emerging

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:11.696 align:middle line:84%
head, which I think
is very recognizable--

00:53:11.696 --> 00:53:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Neanderthals would
have recognized it.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But you also have-- look
what we're standing on.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.844 align:middle line:84%
Sort of this staging area
right in front of it,

00:53:21.844 --> 00:53:23.260 align:middle line:84%
which I think could
have been used

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:27.590 align:middle line:84%
for ritual purposes,
ceremonies, initiations.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:28.899 align:middle line:90%
It would make a perfect place.

00:53:28.899 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like a-- I
don't want to call it

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:84%
an altar, but a stage where
things could take place

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.050 align:middle line:90%
with the backdrop of the head.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Here on this area in front
of the emerging head,

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.680 align:middle line:84%
where I've suggested that
ceremonies, rituals may

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.480 align:middle line:84%
have been taking place,
look what we have.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.262 align:middle line:84%
What this is is sort
of a scooped out area.

00:53:54.262 --> 00:53:55.221 align:middle line:90%
>>It's almost a round--

00:53:55.221 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a round, sort
of basin area.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:00.430 align:middle line:84%
If you put your hand in it,
it's filled with rainwater now

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:01.320 align:middle line:90%
and sediment.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's actually quite deep.

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Very.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.331 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is deep, and I'm
not really touching the end.

00:54:07.331 --> 00:54:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it's quite deep.

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>It's just sediment.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just sediment that's
collected in modern times.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:17.580 align:middle line:84%
But what I think we have here
is really a depression or basin

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
area that would
have been perfect

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:25.180 align:middle line:84%
for ritualistic purposes, for
different ceremonial purposes.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.330 align:middle line:84%
It may have started out
as a natural depression,

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
but I believe it was probably
enhanced by people rubbing it,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:90%
scratching it.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:39.030 align:middle line:84%
You see in more recent
ancient sites from only a few

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.750 align:middle line:84%
thousand years ago, say at
temple complexes in Egypt,

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:48.060 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey, places where
people will rub the rock.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll scrape it, and
it makes depressions.

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
the sacredness, the power

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.120 align:middle line:90%
from that sacred site.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:59.000 align:middle line:84%
This may have been formed
initially the same way, formed

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:90%
this depression.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:04.300 align:middle line:84%
This now serves for
ceremonial purposes.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>How many people
would you need--

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, many--

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>In order to create
something like this.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, a lot if you're
scraping it like that.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.166 align:middle line:84%
>>Over a very long
period of time.

00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Over a very long
period of time.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Thousands and thousands--

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Of generations, potentially,
if they're doing it by hand

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and rubbing it or
scraping away at it.

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But once you have it,
you've got this depression,

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.360 align:middle line:84%
this basin that could
be used for any number

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.100 align:middle line:90%
of ceremonial purposes.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was filled with
water and used for some kind

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of cleansing ritual.

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was used for some kind
of sanctified or holy water.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.615 align:middle line:84%
We still have those
concepts today,

00:55:39.615 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:84%
either cleansing
rituals as you go

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.890 align:middle line:84%
into a sacred place
or holy water that

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:48.420 align:middle line:84%
brings the power
of the sacred site,

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and lets you may be ingest it
or sprinkle it on yourself.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Baptism.

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.650 align:middle line:84%
We still use water from a
basin from a depression.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was used to collect
some kind of sacrifice

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:03.580 align:middle line:90%
for the gods.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was filled with liquid.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some kind of drink.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was used to
collect blood if there

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.370 align:middle line:90%
were sacrifices of animals.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>We saw a little bit
higher, that basin area

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that may have been used
for ceremonial purposes.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.350 align:middle line:90%
To me, this is very similar.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.470 align:middle line:90%
This is not exactly a basin.

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Possibly it was at one point,
if this has eroded back

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:90%
in more recent times.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You can see there
some breakage there.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But what it looks like is
an area that eroded out.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.015 align:middle line:90%
You can put your hand--

00:56:36.015 --> 00:56:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Almost.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I really cannot
reach in the end.

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it goes way back.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Probably up to--

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>At least back to there.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And what it looks to
me like is a place

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:51.800 align:middle line:84%
where people may
have been scraping

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.950 align:middle line:90%
at it, removing material.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:59.924 align:middle line:84%
It's a slightly different rock
here in the general matrix.

00:56:59.924 --> 00:57:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It would have
attracted attention.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You see it's sort of an
orange-ish, reddish color.

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But like you see at other sacred
sites of more recent origin,

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.090 align:middle line:84%
it may have been a place
where people scratched

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.270 align:middle line:84%
it to try to get a
little bit of powder,

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:20.070 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of the,
essentially, power,

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:23.055 align:middle line:90%
the sacred power of this spot.

00:57:23.055 --> 00:57:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Another feature that is on the
plateau that really struck me

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:50.880 align:middle line:84%
is what we can call the bearded
head or the bearded man's head.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge structure.

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful, very
moving in my mind.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that whether
it's natural or artificial

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.720 align:middle line:84%
or some combination
of both, this

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.800 align:middle line:84%
is something that
may have survived

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.680 align:middle line:84%
from a very long time
ago, geologically,

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and may have moved people
and been recognized

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.120 align:middle line:84%
by people, specifically
Neanderthals,

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.840 align:middle line:84%
before the end of
the last ice age.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.490 align:middle line:84%
That they would have recognized
this as looking like a face,

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:28.700 align:middle line:84%
as a bearded face,
just like we do now.

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks to me like what
some people's image of God is.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, a Judeo-Christian
bearded male figure.

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that you find
it up in the mountains.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.095 align:middle line:84%
And you approach it, and
it seems to be, in my mind,

00:58:43.095 --> 00:58:45.300 align:middle line:90%
a sacred, ritualistic setting.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that the name that's
been given to it is the Mechid.

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a name that goes back.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:54.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't know exactly how long.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's called the
Mechid, which loosely

00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:00.220 align:middle line:90%
translates as the church.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And this suggests right away
that there's something special

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.370 align:middle line:90%
about this area.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:06.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the Mechid?

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It's this incredible limestone
formation, huge formation,

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.320 align:middle line:90%
incredibly symmetrical.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to me as if
it were a stage or a podium,

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.730 align:middle line:90%
but of enormous scale.

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.010 align:middle line:90%
At a scale-- I think of giants.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge scale.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's symmetrically arranged.

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It itself is symmetrical.

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:37.060 align:middle line:10%
And it sits in the little valley
area that forms, in my mind,

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.220 align:middle line:10%
a natural amphitheater.

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:44.060 align:middle line:10%
This, I can't help but think,
would form a perfect stage

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.370 align:middle line:10%
for ceremonies, for
ritual practices,

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.980 align:middle line:10%
for initiation,
for other types of

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:53.030 align:middle line:10%
sacred and religious practices.

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:56.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe at night it
would be even more dramatic

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:59.870 align:middle line:84%
if there were huge
bonfires on the Mechid,

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:05.450 align:middle line:84%
if various trees like evergreen
trees were thrown onto bonfires

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and then sparked
up like fireworks.

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
If there was drumming, if there
were singing, music, voices.

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think this could be
a very powerful setting

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.380 align:middle line:90%
for ceremonial purposes.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
All of the pieces, in
my mind, come together

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
here to suggest that this
is a central location.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The river, the ancient name for
the river, which effectively

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
originates at the
Mechid, is sometimes

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
interpreted or translated
as divine river,

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.550 align:middle line:90%
or the heavenly river.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So here we have more allusions
to the divine, to the sacred.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.020 align:middle line:90%
But there's still more.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
On one side of the valley,
the rock formations,

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
the rock peak is
referred to as the Origin

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Peak, or the beginning peak.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This suggests to me a
religious connotation

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of the origins of the universe,
the cosmos, of people.

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.070 align:middle line:90%
How did things originate?

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Sort of in a Judeo-Christian
sense, a genesis?

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
How did life itself and the
universe, the cosmos originate?

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
valley, the formations

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%
are known as the Goddesses.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Clear reference to
divinity, especially

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking
about Neanderthals,

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and they put a lot of emphasis
on women and goddesses.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So we've got the Goddesses.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.150 align:middle line:90%
We've got the Origins.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.540 align:middle line:90%
We've got the Mechid.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got the heavenly
or divine river.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And then if we keep going
further north beyond the Mechid

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to the highest peak,
we have the Peak

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Human Being,
which suggests

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to me that origins of life,
the origins of humanity.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Processions would be
carried on, going up

01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
the river valley from the
south up toward the Mechid.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:06.715 align:middle line:84%
As you ascend up the river
valley toward the plateau,

01:02:06.715 --> 01:02:10.670 align:middle line:84%
you find the Mechid as
a very central location.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing else like
this in the vicinity.

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like
this in the area.

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like this
potentially in all of Europe.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps this was a focal
point, a gathering place

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
for ancient Neanderthal
people from a very

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.710 align:middle line:90%
broad geographic region.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I could see this very
much as a gathering

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
place for sacred
rituals, for ceremonies.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as I've
looked at the maps,

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
as I've looked at the
geology and the topography,

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the geography of
this region, you

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything
like this anywhere else.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a place
that's at high altitude

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
where from below, it looks
like huge mountain peaks.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're in the
Carpathian Mountains.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But then when you get up to
the top, it's like a fortress,

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and it opens up
into this plateau.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the middle of
the fortress, there is--

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Structures like this.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>This natural or
artificial feature.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Here it is.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So this would be
a gathering point.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I see it very much
as a gathering

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%
point, a ceremonial point.

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder as I think about
how widespread the populations

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
were that would gather here
periodically, because there's

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
no other area that's
as well-suited as this

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
for, I believe,
hundreds of kilometers.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about Neanderthal culture

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and consistent rituals over
a large geographic area,

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
consistent beliefs,
shared beliefs,

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:51.450 align:middle line:84%
shared religious ceremonies,
periodically, they

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
would gather all together
to exchange stories,

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
ceremonies that would bond

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.630 align:middle line:90%
different communities together.

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
perfect spot for that.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's a strong
Neanderthal presence here.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We have a number of caves,
caves that occur along the river

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
valley as you ascend
up toward the Mechid

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:17.550 align:middle line:90%
and up toward the plateau.

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
These caves to this
day preserve evidence

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
of Neanderthal
presence, evidence

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:26.800 align:middle line:90%
of Neanderthal rituals.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>The anthropoid face of the
Sphinx looks towards the west

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.872 align:middle line:90%
to the Old Lady Mountain.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:39.298 align:middle line:10%
Inside that mountain,
there is a cave considered

01:04:39.298 --> 01:04:42.970 align:middle line:10%
sacred for a very long time.

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:47.720 align:middle line:10%
Robert and I, we
go to investigate.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.250 align:middle line:90%

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Very echo-y.

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
The perfect place for some
type of musical ceremony.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe there were ritual
feasts in a chamber like this.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>What's the behavior of-- what
was the behavioral of ice age

bears?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And also--

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Would it be natural
for-- would so many of them

01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
come here to die?

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.137 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:20.137 --> 01:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And they just all
decided to come here

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.400 align:middle line:90%
when they were about to die.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>It's also possible
that perhaps they

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:27.315 align:middle line:90%
were used in rituals.

01:05:27.315 --> 01:05:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what I'm thinking.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.050 align:middle line:90%
They'd be using tame bears.

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And if this place was
used for performance,

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.030 align:middle line:84%
it would make a lot
of sense that they

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.510 align:middle line:90%
would have the dancing bears.

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.310 align:middle line:90%
[WATER RUSHING]

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:42.494 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

>>Really incredible space.

01:05:44.904 --> 01:05:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing experience.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
For me, it creates
an experience that

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is really extraordinary,
very moving.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to
find the right words.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.905 align:middle line:90%
It's not easily put in language.

01:06:06.806 --> 01:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
See, I'm wondering how
they're physically following

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:11.014 align:middle line:90%
the river at this point.

01:06:11.014 --> 01:06:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Because the best
would be 20 meters down.

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>And the river is--

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>And the river's going
through that pass.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:25.873 align:middle line:84%
And here it would be almost
the same - almost narrower.

01:06:25.873 --> 01:06:27.897 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:06:27.897 --> 01:06:29.480 align:middle line:10%
See, what I'm saying,
where would they

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.757 align:middle line:10%
be walking unless they're
walking right in the river?

01:06:32.757 --> 01:06:34.340 align:middle line:10%
>>That's what I would
think, that they

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.120 align:middle line:10%
would be walking in the river.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>People could have been
coming from many even hundreds

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
of kilometers or more away,
gathering at a certain time.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this was something that
happened every few years.

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was even
major ceremonies that

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.950 align:middle line:90%
occurred once in a generation.

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:55.760 align:middle line:90%
And it was a pilgrimage.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can very
much imagine-- and I

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
think it's more than
just imagination.

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We can reconstruct,
start to reconstruct

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
how such a pilgrimages occurred,
and what practices would have

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:10.750 align:middle line:90%
been carried out along the way.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe initiations were
carried out along the passage,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.560 align:middle line:90%
getting up to the plateau.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And one question is,
can we successfully

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.110 align:middle line:90%
integrate these two aspects?

01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Arguably, Neanderthals
were much closer to nature.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They understood how they
fitted into nature much better

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.880 align:middle line:90%
than Cro-Magnons.

Even with really
good vision, they

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
had to have some
kind of illumination.

>> For me-- I don't
know for you--

01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
everything is a lot
more organic and alive.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:43.859 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I agree.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:44.680 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.779 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the harsh
headlamps and flashlights,

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
they sort of flatten everything.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.229 align:middle line:90%
You don't see the texture to it.

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%

With things like pine
trees and whatnot.

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
If you brought in
the pine branches,

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
you know how if you light them,
they just all of a sudden,

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.230 align:middle line:84%
for a short period of time,
you have-- it's like fireworks.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.488 align:middle line:84%
>>And I could see
them doing things

01:10:18.488 --> 01:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
like that for dramatic
effect and at certain times.

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You know, during a ceremony.

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I bet a lot of the hearths
and a lot of the fire

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.292 align:middle line:84%
remains that are found had
nothing to do with warmth.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
It was probably ritualistic.

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
used to the climate.

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And they would have fur.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.353 align:middle line:84%
>>And they would
have fur and whatnot.

01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:41.805 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if anything, I
could say during these rituals,

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
they might have been overheated
because they're not-- you know,

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.700 align:middle line:90%
fires get really hot like that.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're used to the
natural climate, and relatively

01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:00.632 align:middle line:84%
cold conditions, and that's
what is normal for you,

01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:03.010 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't want to be
building these huge fires

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:05.050 align:middle line:84%
just to get really hot,
then to go back out

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.190 align:middle line:90%
and get really cold.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:06.990 align:middle line:10%
You

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:09.530 align:middle line:10%
>>Build a huge fire, and
then also wear the fur,

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:13.350 align:middle line:10%
and you would be boiling up.

01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the traditional image you
see everywhere of Neanderthals.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Huddling around the fire.

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>All around the
fire, wearing furs.

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
That's probably not
the case at all.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Christmas traditions, which of
course are way pre-Christian,

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:36.425 align:middle line:84%
bringing in a tree,
bringing in-- what

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:40.160 align:middle line:84%
do you call it--
wreaths and vines.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>And does that go back
100,000 years or more?

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>This was covered
with snow and ice.

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:54.690 align:middle line:84%
The caves that we are
going to see in a bit

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
were probably
covered by glaciers.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Or on the edge of
a glacier somehow.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.872 align:middle line:90%


01:12:03.872 --> 01:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the Bear Cave.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.200 align:middle line:10%
Reminds me of a pyramid in
the sense of the height.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.490 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you know, I bet the floor
may have been lower back then.

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:17.832 align:middle line:90%
With all these deposits.

01:12:17.832 --> 01:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, deposits inside here.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.960 align:middle line:90%


01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I can see, it's-- getting
more and more beautiful.

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%


01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like a cathedral.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't get-- at least I don't
get this feel from a quote,

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.860 align:middle line:90%
"real church," unquote.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Modern church.

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>So it makes so
much sense that this

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
would be, like you said
before, a ritual cave.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm thinking if
they were bringing

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
crystals in or special
stones, things probably

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:51.510 align:middle line:90%
take them out again.

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Use them.

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm even thinking
if they were

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
using some kind of
crystals or whatnot,

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.430 align:middle line:84%
they might bring them
in, sort of sanctify

01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
them, if I could
put it that way.

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:03.683 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd want
to take them with them.

01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like we
expect-- it's not

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
like we would expect them to
leave their valuables just

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
laying about for
us to find later.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Stunning.

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Those are really stunning.

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>What a beautiful environment.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is really
interesting how it works.

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>A few candles
and a few crystals,

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, you have an
extraordinary, unexpected

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
experience away from
modern life and time.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
What do think about this
setting with all the--

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.170 align:middle line:90%
with about 15 candles?

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:46.302 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:13:46.302 --> 01:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the first church
or sanctuary or cathedral.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you want to call it.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Very much, yeah.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It has the feel of a cathedral.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the
modern, artificial churches

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and cathedrals, they're
trying to imitate this.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Not vice versa.

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:12.095 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:14:12.095 --> 01:14:16.415 align:middle line:84%
It makes me really feel
religion, but not--

01:14:16.415 --> 01:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, spirituality.

01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>In a very deep
and personal sense.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Not like an organized religion,
but a real deep feeling

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of sanctity and
spirituality, I would say.

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>You go into a cathedral
in many cases, one that's

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
not illuminated by
modern lighting,

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's illuminated
the more traditional way

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
with very subdued lighting,
essentially, in my mind,

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to an
artificial cave.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that many of the
churches and cathedrals we

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
see now from medieval
or Renaissance

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
times, for instance,
are actually

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
a legacy, a legacy of
the cave, the cave being

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
used as a ritualistic site.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of these legacies may
go back tens of thousands

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.370 align:middle line:90%
of years.

01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I suspect, for a
Neanderthal culture,

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
for Neanderthal civilization,
maybe the single most important

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
thing, the most central point
was their religion, what

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.480 align:middle line:90%
we would now call religion.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure they would have
used that term, because it

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
may have been so
all-encompassing for them

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that it was well beyond what
we think of religion now

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.570 align:middle line:90%
in a modern, Western sense.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
But the religiosity, the mental
world that they developed.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call it a
religious/magical sense.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And they may have been
incredibly sophisticated,

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
incredibly developed.

01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I think possibly well
beyond where we are today.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The Cro-Magnons,
I would speculate,

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
tried to put it into
simplistic terms.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's going on
with these other people,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.510 align:middle line:90%
these Neanderthals?

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
We can't really understand
what's going on,

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.889 align:middle line:84%
so they try to categorize
it in simple terms.

01:16:08.889 --> 01:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes it's black,
sometimes it's white,

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're
doing good things,

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.020 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're
doing bad things.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And our modern concept of things
like a good god, a bad devil,

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
angels versus
Satan may have come

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
from a simplistic
Cro-Magnon understanding

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
of much more subtle, much more
nuanced Neanderthal rituals

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I suspect for Neanderthals,
it wasn't a simple category

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of good on one side and
bad on the other side,

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
or what we would
call God and devil.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It may have been
much more nuanced.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It may have seemed
you need both aspects.

01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I even think of ancient
religions in a classical sense.

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
For instance, ancient Egyptians.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.570 align:middle line:84%
They did not make
this same distinction

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:10.470 align:middle line:84%
between good and bad as
modern society often does.

01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
They realized that
for the working

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.850 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the universe, in
a general sense as they saw it,

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
there had to be
both good and bad.

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
You had to have
both sides, or what

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.500 align:middle line:90%
we would call good and bad.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They were just two ends
of a continuous spectrum.

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that Neanderthals
saw a lot of gray area also.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.726 align:middle line:84%
>>I would say, well, we've
got to accept that we are,

01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, Neanderthal
and Cro-Magnon in one.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to do.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>What we really have to do
is to take our dual aspects,

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the Cro-Magnon aspects
and Neanderthal aspects,

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
combine them so that either
overpowers the other,

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.070 align:middle line:90%
hit a balance between them.

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do
that successfully,

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
we may, in fact,
create something

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.390 align:middle line:90%
that rises above either.

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%


01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>It could have been some
sort of ritual or pilgrimage

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
that would come here.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Sort of a returning.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Returning to the beginning.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe certain times of year.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Or there may even be times that
even bigger groups got together

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.930 align:middle line:90%
on a more lengthy cycle.

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Cyclic.

01:18:57.730 --> 01:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Cyclical maybe.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, based on a lunar
cycle of the-- what is it?

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The 19-year return, or
something like that,

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
which was essentially
be a generational thing.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And you might have a huge
sort of congregation of--

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:13.581 align:middle line:90%
>>Hundreds or--

01:19:13.581 --> 01:19:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>If not more.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Possibly thousands of people.

01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Which would have been--
and you can visualize.

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:24.104 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
really amazing.

01:19:24.104 --> 01:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>It's something that makes
it very intimate and personal.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>At the same time, it's also
very public and communal,

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:34.230 align:middle line:90%
but it's also very private.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's reminding me
of being in the caves.

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So you get in almost
that intimacy here,

01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
but then you can go out and
it's sort of ties them together.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.120 align:middle line:90%


01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It's almost as though--
yeah, like I said, the shock.

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.770 align:middle line:90%
They were bringing out whatever.

01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>And you're exposing it.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.106 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:20:01.106 --> 01:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening here.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>To the people
in the community.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and to the nature.

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.272 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:20:08.272 --> 01:20:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It really does look like that.

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And because our civilization,
it's based on such triviality.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems today we are
missing something vital

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.660 align:middle line:90%
to our human well-being.

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We are missing that deep
connection with nature

01:20:23.770 --> 01:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the Neanderthals had
so well developed.

01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
How would rediscovering
Neanderthal values

01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:32.150 align:middle line:90%
impact our civilization today?

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
What will this new awareness
bring to our lives?

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
They lived around the
mountains and carved into them.

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They appreciated
the natural beauty

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and had high mental abilities.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Ruzo called them the guardians
of an ancient wisdom.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a magical work, done
by a culture whose science

01:20:55.890 --> 01:21:00.826 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of the world
was different from the present.

01:21:00.826 --> 01:21:04.595 align:middle line:84%
>>I think modern society
or people in modern society

01:21:04.595 --> 01:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
are afraid to deal
with a lot of things.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I think they're almost
a terrible stereotype

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
or generalization, but they're
afraid to deal with anything

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
that's really meaningful.

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not a given that a culture
has to be materialistic.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Archaeologist Ralph
Solecki ended his book

01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
"Shanidar: The
First Flower People"

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:32.530 align:middle line:84%
saying, "in the face of
the growing evidence,

01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
we will be forced to
accept Neanderthal

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.770 align:middle line:90%
as our real human ancestor."

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>And so you have this dichotomy
between religion and intuition

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:49.145 align:middle line:84%
with Neanderthals, reason
and logic with Cro-Magnons.

01:21:49.145 --> 01:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And Stan Gooch says that
it was sort of monumental

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:58.540 align:middle line:90%
when the two met.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Also, you had two different
world views coming together.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Neither really
understood the other.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So Neanderthals didn't
really understand

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
these new Cro-Magnons that
were invading their territory.

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
The Cro-Magnons didn't
really understand

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
what the Neanderthals were doing
with all these weird rituals

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and ceremonies and
dancing and singing.

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.230 align:middle line:90%
That was foreign to them.

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They tried to figure it
out, what they called magic.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And they probably-- I mean, how
would you see these rituals?

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They would have to
spy probably at night.

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Night.

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:34.885 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:22:34.885 --> 01:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Try to figure out
what's going on.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.312 align:middle line:90%
>>From a distance.

01:22:38.312 --> 01:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>It must have been
very mysterious, very

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
scary to the Cro-Magnons
to see these people doing

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.730 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you don't
understand something,

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.890 align:middle line:90%
you fear it in many cases.

01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Much of our culture--

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>And our beliefs--

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>--and our beliefs--

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Our religious practices--

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>--that's inheritance
from Neanderthals.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So we, in a cultural
sense, carry

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.408 align:middle line:90%
on many Neanderthal traditions.

01:23:04.408 --> 01:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%


01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Erik Trinkaus, a leading
Neanderthal expert,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
is convinced that a
cult of immortality

01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
was invented by
the Neanderthals.

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
He thinks the Neanderthals
were the first ones to practice

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
burials, and that Homo Sapien,
Cro-Magnon, learned how to bury

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.112 align:middle line:90%
the dead from the Neanderthals.

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
He observed how they buried and
how they did their practices,

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.737 align:middle line:90%
and so he copied them.

01:23:44.737 --> 01:23:51.560 align:middle line:90%


01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.541 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Ruzo had said that
the Carpathian Mountains were

01:23:55.541 --> 01:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the oldest
European civilization known

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:01.350 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The first age was the age
of truth and knowledge.

01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
The people lived around
the sacred mountains

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of pyramidal summits,
and carved into them

01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
for us and for the
future generations,

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:17.300 align:middle line:90%
signaling the caves.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:21.420 align:middle line:10%
"The cave represents the
other world, but also

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.906 align:middle line:10%
the entire universe.

01:24:22.906 --> 01:24:25.700 align:middle line:10%
It is a place that
constitutes a world--

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.950 align:middle line:10%
>>--in itself.

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:30.870 align:middle line:10%
The ritual cave sometimes
imitates the night sky.

01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it is an mago
mandi, a universe in miniature.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Living in a cave
does not necessarily

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.980 align:middle line:84%
imply going down
among the shades.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:48.475 align:middle line:84%
It can as well imply living in
a different world, a world that

01:24:48.475 --> 01:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is vaster and more complex
because it incorporates

01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
various modes of existence,
and hence is full of riches

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.095 align:middle line:90%
and countless virtualities."

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>"Here in the mountains of
Romania lies the blood of men,

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:09.870 align:middle line:84%
the subterraneous tunnels
where humanity saved itself

01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:11.620 align:middle line:90%
during the flood.

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
These are the caverns
of the treasure referred

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.490 align:middle line:90%
to in so many world legends."

>>The Egyptian Sphinx is
part of a larger complex,

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.375 align:middle line:84%
just like the Carpathian Sphinx
is part of a larger complex.

01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So in both cases,
I believe we're

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
talking sacred ceremonial sites
that held incredible importance

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
to their respective people, to
their respective populations.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>>"It is in these
sacred mountains

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:43.470 align:middle line:10%
where people found their
salvation after the flood,

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:45.440 align:middle line:10%
and where they
will be saved when

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.180 align:middle line:10%
the next catastrophe occurs.

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.480 align:middle line:10%
It is vital today to find
these sacred mountains

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.490 align:middle line:10%
and sacred caves."

01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>They and other
ancient-- you know,

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
certain other ancient peoples,
but we'll focus on Neanderthals

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
for now-- were much more
sophisticated in ways

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even have a
good language to describe.

01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have traditions
around the world.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The golden age,
which I think is not

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
referred to a
materialist golden age.

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:49.560 align:middle line:90%


01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Our civilization has progressed
one way, materialistically.

01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And that type of
sophistication, we've plummeted.

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:59.560 align:middle line:90%


01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
To judge a culture
like the Neanderthals

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:10.048 align:middle line:84%
by the scanty remains, physical
remains, it's sort of insane.

01:27:10.048 --> 01:27:14.000 align:middle line:90%


01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Neanderthals,
with their traditions,

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:21.860 align:middle line:84%
with their concepts,
they were the pioneers.

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the universe with its
cosmic rhythms, untold beauty,

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and great dangers, they
understood themselves

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
as part of something bigger
than they themselves were.

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They knew their place
in the order of things.

01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:40.346 align:middle line:84%
We need to recover that
sense of the world.

01:27:40.346 --> 01:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>In waking up to
the new paradigm,

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we recover something
long lost, something

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:50.600 align:middle line:90%
very old in ourselves.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
"When you climb a mountain, you
go with humility and devotion,

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
as in a cathedral, where you
enter not to conquer a creed,

01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but to rediscover yourself,
to rediscover something

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
inside yourself,
hidden for so long,

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.910 align:middle line:90%
that awaits to be awakened.

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:11.480 align:middle line:90%

hidden for so long that

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.130 align:middle line:90%
awaits to be awakened."

01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Here's a setting
where effectively

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in the mythology and
the religious beliefs,

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.870 align:middle line:90%
humans may have originated.

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this was
the most important,

01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
the most sacred, the
most central location

01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.930 align:middle line:84%
for Neanderthal
populations as a whole.

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:50.450 align:middle line:90%


01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you're approaching
an incredible cathedral,

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and incredibly holy spot.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And as you approach it,
you come to various points

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
where you prepare yourself
for the ultimate adventure,

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate religious
experience at the highest

01:29:12.610 --> 01:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
peaks.

01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So this entire complex,
which in many ways

01:29:20.050 --> 01:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is symbolized by the
Carpathian Sphinx,

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is a huge, religious,
ceremonial, ritualistic complex

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that must have been
incredibly important

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Neanderthal people for
generations and generations,

01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
probably thousands and
thousands of generations

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.750 align:middle line:90%
over tens of thousands of years.

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Really important to
me to be able to come

01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
here and experience
firsthand the caves,

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to experience
firsthand the plateau,

01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to experience firsthand
the Carpathian Sphinx.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
To me, in fact, in
some ways, we can

01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
think of the Carpathian
Sphinx as being

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:06.430 align:middle line:90%
a symbol for a lost world.

01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Literally a lost
people, a lost culture.

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
The mountain is
a lost cathedral,

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:17.329 align:middle line:84%
and the Carpathian
Sphinx is the lost altar.
