always told stories of it,

just to keep me from running
away from the camping area.

No.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.612 align:middle line:90%
There is something.

I'd gone to the trouble
of going to California,

So I wanted to know what
was making those tracks,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's basically
the pursuit I've

been following for
nearly half a century.

not knowledgeably
disputed, anyway--

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that something makes enormous
footprints that indicate

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:90%
enormous weight.

people whose word would not

tell of seeing a huge, hair
covered biped in North America.

And science cannot explain
that fact and isn't trying to.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>>There are precious few
scientists, very few scientists

about this phenomenon

that the evidence,
such as it is,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:10%
would suggest to us
that this bears looking

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:10%
into in an experimental
or an open-minded way.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Very few.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.827 align:middle line:84%
That's why I respect those
few, such as John Bindernagel,

00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and a very few other people
with a scientific background

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:90%

>>It's not a matter of belief
or faith in something here.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of having
scrutinized the evidence

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and found it adequate
and realizing

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Our problem is to attract
scientific colleagues

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:90%
to scrutinize that evidence.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>But scientists are, in a
sense, businessmen as well.

time to those things that

not make the cut.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>There is no prevailing model
of anthropology and zoology,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest, that
eliminates the possibility, let

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
alone the likelihood,
of Bigfoot.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Not an evolutionary ground.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Not on a biogeographical ground.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Not on an ecological ground.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Not on a metabolic ground.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.004 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that keeps
scientists, I think,

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
from putting their necks out
and saying "this is something

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
worth our looking into" is
their own fear of ridicule.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not that scientists
are out there looking for it

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and can't find it.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
looking the other way.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not the Sasquatch
which has eluded scientists,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.685 align:middle line:84%
but scientists which have
chosen to elude the Sasquatch.

00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to hear about it.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Scientists are
not used to working

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
in areas where there's
hoaxing going on,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
where there's people
fooling other people.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:10%
That's very much contrary to
the scientific method, which

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:10%
is very much open
and accountable

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:10%
and everything is published
and is open to scrutiny.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.684 align:middle line:84%
The area is riddled
with hoaxery.

00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Nobody denies that,
and scientists

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.808 align:middle line:84%
try to stay away from
that sort of thing.

00:08:43.808 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>When we talk
about the Sasquatch

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
as just another North
American mammal-- you know,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I always think of my work doing
wildlife surveys, especially

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
mammal surveys-- where
we are able to determine

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the presence of a
mammal in an area

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:90%
on the basis of its tracks.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Mammals aren't like birds.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:90%
They're not so easily seen.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:90%
They're elusive.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
They're often nocturnal.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:90%
So we look for signs.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:90%
We look for tracks.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:90%
We look for scat.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
We look for feeding sign.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
On the basis of
seeing bear tracks,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
we say, yes, there are
black bears in this area,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:90%
or grizzly bears.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Same with the Sasquatch.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
This is an original.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the best cast, actually,
that my wife and I were

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
able to make here
on Vancouver Island.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, between the time
we found them and by the time

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:10%
we got back with plaster,
a hiker had stepped in it.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bit of
a boot print there.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, it's just
an awfully good, awfully good

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
cast showing the large
heel and the five toes.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Here are a couple of casts
of an immature Sasquatch

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:90%
from Washington state.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And people often say, well, if
you've got a young Sasquatch,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
the track would look like
a human track, wouldn't it?

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, they don't actually.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
One of things quite
common in Sasquatch tracks

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:90%
is the spreading of the toes.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch foot seems
to be-- is much more

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
flexible than the
human foot, which

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:90%
is quite rigid by comparison.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
human hand, and then

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
the toes quite commonly
spread out like that.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the largest
cast in my collection.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's noteworthy from
that point of view.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
It's also noteworthy
because the big toe,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
the great toe is
quite divergent,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
sticking off to the side,
which is very much an ape

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.315 align:middle line:90%
characteristic.

00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Of course in the great apes, the
big toe is often straight out.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
In the Sasquatch, the big
toe often diverges somewhat,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and that's quite unhuman-like.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>That's a gigantic cast.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.619 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a very large track.

00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
There's a bit of slide in here.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that the heel
actually started about there.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
This is an interesting
cast because it

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
shows another characteristic
of the Sasquatch foot,

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
just as is shown in
these young ones.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is it is
proportionately broader

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
than the human foot.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>UFOs and Bigfoot are
probably about tied for fraud.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot fraud is
somebody strapping

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
on a big pair of
wooden feet to his feet

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and stomping around
in the bush and then

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.905 align:middle line:84%
taking clay molds
of it, or whatever.

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:08.641 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>When you're up
in the bush and you

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
come across a set of
tracks so far removed

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.897 align:middle line:84%
from any of the nearest
roads-- you didn't even

00:11:15.897 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
know you were going
to be at that spot

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
at that given moment-- who on
earth put those tracks there?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
How did they get there,
and why are they there ?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:10%
You can't just turn away
from that and just say, ah,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:10%
somebody's playing a joke.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
play a joke, you're

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:84%
going to go down
by a park where you

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:90%
know people will see something.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
go way up in the bush.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I've seen instances where
I pushed a bush back

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.296 align:middle line:84%
to step down off of a log fall
and there was a track right

00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
there, where the
animal obviously

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.476 align:middle line:84%
had stepped where the
bush was and moved it out

00:11:44.476 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of the way as it passed
through, and the bush

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
covered it back over
and protected the track.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.107 align:middle line:84%
Nobody set that hoping
I'd see that someday.

00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:51.815 align:middle line:90%
That's ludicrous.

00:11:51.815 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going up to
Harrison Hot Springs

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to pay a visit with a
colleague of mine named

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Bill Miller, who's an
American from Illinois.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:10%
The last two summers now,
we've been using Bill's Polaris

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:10%
Ranger, sort of a six
wheel, all-terrain vehicle

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:10%
which basically gets--
can go anywhere.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.752 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:26.085 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I think would
be better would be a horse.

00:12:26.085 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Highway seven here, also
known as Lougheed Highway,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
at one time was known as
Scenic Sasquatch Drive

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
reported the thing crossing

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in front of them at
night right on this road.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We've actually
passed a couple spots

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%
where sightings have occurred.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Sasquatch was a Chehalis word
which basically translates

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
into "wild man of the woods."

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was here in
the 1920s that really

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.605 align:middle line:84%
the non-native community
found out about it.

00:12:58.605 --> 00:13:03.647 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.647 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been fascinated
by this mystery

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
ever since I was
old enough to read.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.585 align:middle line:84%
I still remember my mother
telling my father, don't worry.

00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:90%
He'll grow out of it.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.376 align:middle line:90%
But it never happened.

00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:13.066 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.066 --> 00:13:14.815 align:middle line:84%
I love the outdoors,
and I love a mystery.

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And the two just went
together hand in hand.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:22.245 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.245 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>They named this place
Sasquatch Provincial Park

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.065 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:28.273 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the long
history of sightings and all

00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that that's always
happening here.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>If we take a fake
foot like your shoe--

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
if you walk through that
snow with your shoes on,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
every print you make is going
to be a duplicate of the last,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
because you're walking with
a solid, inanimate object.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
a real working foot,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.305 align:middle line:84%
there are signs
you can look for.

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:50.931 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:52.823 align:middle line:90%
>>Muk luks.

00:13:52.823 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Boots.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>We know that from
the old days, Green

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and all these guys that
documented these things,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.756 align:middle line:90%
people's tracks are offset.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
When you watch to see
your tracks in the snow

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
or in the sand--
left, right-- they're

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit offset,
usually pointed outward.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
A Sasquatch walks
almost pigeon toed,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
but he walks like he's
walking a tight rope, almost.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Every track is almost the
same, in a straight line

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:90%
in front of the other one.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we look for
is, is it a fake track?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
When you see a line
of tracks, and you

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
see toe movement
between the tracks,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
you no longer have a fake
foot, or else somebody's

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
able to carry a bunch
of fake feet with them

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and somehow put it
on between strides

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:90%
without putting a foot down.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
That makes no sense at all.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>A tip is to not try to
sneak around in the field.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:10%
They are far superior to us as
far as living in the forest,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:10%
and all of their senses
are better than ours.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I would strongly
recommend that someone

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.534 align:middle line:84%
who wants to draw Sasquatch
to you-- because that's

00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:90%
what it's going to be.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
go find a Sasquatch.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:90%
They're going to find you.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So go into a likely
area, do not be quiet.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Be loud.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Have fun.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.787 align:middle line:90%
Laugh.

00:15:04.787 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what we do.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:90%
We sing in the field.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, honestly.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you can do that's
gentle, that's not aggressive.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>A lady who owns
a store in Sechelt,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
she'd driven the same
route home for 10 years.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Then one night she went home.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Just as it was getting
dark, this thing

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
crossed the highway,
the major highway,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:90%
crossed right in front of her.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>And her little
daughter had seen it.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
She was with her
on the road when

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:90%
it crossed in front of them.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And she calls it the big monkey.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter of
whether or not she saw nothing.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:90%
She saw something.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.353 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl, small as
she is, knows what a monkey is,

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and in her mind,
that's what she saw.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Something that
looked like a monkey.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the lady, on top
of everything else,

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.597 align:middle line:84%
even though she
talked to Tom, she

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want her name out there.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.679 align:middle line:84%
These aren't people
looking for publicity.

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.617 align:middle line:84%
These are people that
just want to tell

00:16:10.617 --> 00:16:12.825 align:middle line:84%
what they saw because they
think it's that important.

00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>I find I almost have to
pry a Sasquatch report out

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:90%
of an eyewitness.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll hear that someone
has had a sighting.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll approach them.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They all wonder how
I got their name.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:90%
They won't want to talk.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
There's almost a bit of a
dance going back and forth,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:90%
and finally I hear the report.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I think I have a pretty good
idea of what Sasquatches look

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:84%
like, all the various
anatomical features

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:84%
that recur consistently
again and again.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm
looking for those

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:90%
in the eyewitness descriptions.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not leading the
witness to provide them,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
but I'm certainly measuring
them as these things come up.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.695 align:middle line:84%
>>Eyewitness accounts are
notoriously unreliable.

00:16:53.695 --> 00:16:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:10%
As skeptics, we harp
on that all the time.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.595 align:middle line:84%
People's ability to
confabulate their own memories.

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
To inject memories into
their own recollection.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
Any young child will
know all an adult has

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to do is make a suggestion to
you, did you see that, son?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And five years later,
you'll swear, yeah,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, I can give
you details about it.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>>When you consider
all the things

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:10%
that people could
describe, there's

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:10%
just a marvelous consistency
in what they do describe.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>As word starting getting
out of what I was doing,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:84%
taking in reports and
going out at night

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and looking for-- I called
them-- the nightwalkers,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the elders of the
tribe were telling me

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that it was bad
medicine to continue

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing, because I
was dealing with something that

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.525 align:middle line:84%
was more powerful than
anything that I can imagine.

00:17:57.525 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought
strengthwise, but they

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
told me spiritually
that they can take you.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.955 align:middle line:90%
It was standing next to a tree.

00:18:10.955 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:10%
My partner had seen it
first from a glimpse,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:10%
and we drove right by it.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:10%
He said there was something
standing back there.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So I backed the truck up,
and I was looking to my left.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And then as I was looking to my
left, he goes, there it goes.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned
immediately to my right.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And I saw something go
from completely standing

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.811 align:middle line:84%
to a full out run, turning
into almost a blur,

00:18:40.811 --> 00:18:42.935 align:middle line:84%
really, as fast as it was
moving through the trees.

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It was gone within two seconds.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.263 align:middle line:90%
I immediately grabbed my stuff.

00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:84%
When I work in the woods now, I
always carry a camera with me.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed my field vest
and I took off after it.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I found the
impressions in the ground,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
and I started tracking it.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And we tracked it
over the hillside,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and that's when we lost it.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>The Sasquatch mystery.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
It sort of tells you
that there's still

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
wilderness out there.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.786 align:middle line:84%
There's still places
we haven't trodden yet.

00:19:23.786 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There's still
things to discover.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:90%
There's still things to see.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
There's still mysteries
to solve, and to me,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:90%
the Sasquatch is exactly that.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's wilderness, you know?

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.705 align:middle line:90%
It's the unknown.

00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the last frontier, and
we're trying to find it.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>People would rather
mythologize than just

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
accept that certain
things aren't known.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That maybe one day science
will explain it, maybe not.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Bigfoot and monsters in general
have a very persuasive power

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.816 align:middle line:84%
They often hail from remote
regions of the forests,

00:20:05.816 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
mountaintops, that
sort of thing.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.097 align:middle line:10%
I think that kind of-- there's
an allure to remoteness.

00:20:10.097 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:10%
Probably something to do with
our evolutionary heritage.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Remote areas were
scary for good reason.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And people have-- their
brains are biologically

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
hardwired to fear the unknown,
because the unknown could have

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
a tiger there or something
that we should avoid.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.227 align:middle line:84%
>>The one that I saw
briefly was about 7 to 7

00:20:30.227 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and a half feet tall.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:10%
It was dark in color.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Hair must've been about,
maybe, 3 inches in length.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't particularly
heavy in body mass.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:90%
It was really lean.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Legs were long.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:10%
>>From eyewitness
descriptions of the Sasquatch,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:10%
it's very, very ape-like.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Most of the anatomical
features are ape-like.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
What is human-like
is that bipedal gait,

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:90%
walking on two feet like humans.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
The foot shape with the big toe
lined up alongside the others.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Very human-like looking foot.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
As we get into the great
ape literature deeply,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
we find that, no, that's not
actually all that human-like.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:10%
In the gorilla foot,
the big toe can also

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:10%
line up with the other toes,
and gorillas, chimpanzees,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:10%
orangutans do walk on two
feet from time to time.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.195 align:middle line:84%
So I think we'll find
out that it's an ape.

00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I honestly believe
that this creature

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
has to be part of
the homo branch.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:10%
It has way more human features
than it does ape-like features.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hybrid of both.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I certainly can't see that.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I see its humanity.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I see its reticence.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
I see its shyness.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I see its behaviors.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Its curiosity.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a creature that
is far more intelligent

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:90%
than people give it credit for.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
It has also managed to
elude us for so long.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.300 align:middle line:84%
The same cannot be said of
gorillas and chimpanzees

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:90%
or the other higher apes.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Certainly humans, chimps,
gorillas, orangs, and Bigfoot,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
if it walks, would belong
to the very same family.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can call that
family great apes.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So does that make
Bigfoot a man or an ape?

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, men are apes.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Men and women are apes.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>We don't like to
be reminded just how

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
similar the great
apes are to us.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
We like the idea of a nice,
wide gap there between humans

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and other mammals of all sorts.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Charles Darwin said
people are far too--

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.114 align:middle line:84%
he didn't use the
language hung up,

00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:84%
but he essentially said
people are far too concerned

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
with the question of the
difference between humans

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and other apes.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.579 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that difference isn't
even very consequential.

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think that's one of the
problems with the Sasquatch.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's disturbing and
upsetting because it

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:90%
does look so human-like.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm in total agreement
with John Green.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.842 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is a bipedal
ape thought to be extinct,

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:01.675 align:middle line:90%
the Gigantopithecus.

00:23:01.675 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.684 align:middle line:84%
>>If a species of
Gigantopithecus still walks,

00:23:06.684 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't make it
any different from a lot

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of other species that still
exists, like the mountain

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
lion that's been around for a
very, very long period of time.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It would simply mean that it
was pretty darned adaptable

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and pretty well
suited to its habitat.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Canada's a huge country.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
millions of square miles

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.725 align:middle line:84%
of unexplored, rugged
terrain there is out there.

00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the bits of evidence,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:90%
you might say, for Sasquatch.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And I would argue that
absence of evidence

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:10%
is evidence of absence for
the most part in this case.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:10%
Human beings have
occupied this part

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:10%
of the country for
a very long time.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to
imagine that a breeding

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:84%
population of creatures as large
as the Sasquatch is reputed

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to be could have avoided
detection for so long.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, yes.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
That is the absolute
keystone question

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:90%
in this entire discussion.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we can talk about
all the evidence in the world

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that bears consideration
that we shouldn't discount,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and we always come
down to that exact question.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And it is a big question.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a really tough
one to get over.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that
keeps me still, I think,

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
appropriately skeptical
at this point,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
even though that skepticism
is weaker than it used to be.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
At any given time, only a small
proportion of that countryside

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:90%
has human eyes focused on it.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge amount
of tangled, wild country

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in which something
could remain hidden.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
add to that an animal

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:90%
of extreme physical adeptness.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:90%
This is an athletic animal.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We know this from
all the reports.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, of course,
of substantial intelligence.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.739 align:middle line:84%
Add in the quality of an
animal that is self aware.

00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:56.405 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not the first
person to mention

00:24:56.405 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:90%
that Bigfoot is self aware.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you add that in with
those other qualities and that

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
it's aware of the plight that
might result from hanging out

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
with the other two-footers,
because of guns, because

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.926 align:middle line:84%
of trucks, and so
on and so forth,

00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are
encounters, then you

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
can begin to imagine an animal
that actually could remain

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.685 align:middle line:84%
hidden under these
circumstances.

00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:34.483 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Carry a camera with
you at all times,

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
because if you are in
a position to ever see

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
one of these things, it's
going to happen very quickly.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get
a photograph of it,

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you're simply another person
who says he saw a Sasquatch,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and we have thousands of those.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Well.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The way I go about
researching-- at the beginning,

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I would take newspaper
reports and people

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
telling me that something's
happening in this area,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
something's just
happened in that area.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:10%
And I would run over there
real quick and ambulance chase.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And quickly I saw that my
resources were dwindling,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's paying
for this except for me.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.799 align:middle line:10%
And I determined that I'm
going to stick closer to home.

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
concentrate on one area.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a study
area that I've

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
been working on
for about 20 years.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I use everything from
satellite imagery

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
down to digital sound
blasting and digital imagery.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got starlight
scopes, infrared.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I've got pheromones.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.392 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.392 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>In the case of
Bigfoot, we don't really

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.516 align:middle line:84%
see that we're
getting any better,

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
higher quality data since
the 1958 first documented

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:90%
footprints were discovered.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The quality of the
data, the sorts

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of data that we're getting,
hasn't really improved.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.276 align:middle line:84%
Our technology's
improving and we're not

00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.332 align:middle line:84%
seeing that translating
into better data, which

00:26:52.332 --> 00:26:52.915 align:middle line:90%
is suspicious.

00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The higher the technology,
the less the result I'm getting.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if I saw a Bigfoot
in a starlight scope,

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
nobody'd believe
it was a Bigfoot.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I think any scientist
looking at it

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is just going to go,
well, that's interesting,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.758 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not interested.

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Because scientists have
chosen not study the Sasquatch,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
dedicated amateurs have come
along and kind of filled

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
that vacuum and taken it on.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are
doing a very good job.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not always as well
trained or as disciplined

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%
as they could be.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
it's not their job.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I think if my biologist
colleagues ever

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:84%
actually decided to
get involved here,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:90%
we'd move ahead really quickly.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>>We were investigating a story.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:10%
We went out to this
clear cut and we let out

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:10%
these huge screams, just
the top of our lungs.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:10%
Just loud screams to attract
attention to something.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So we walked into
the trees, and as we

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
were going into the timber,
we found a game trail.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We started following
this game trail.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we took about four
or five more steps

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:84%
down this game trail, and we
heard this-- [HEAVY BREATHING]

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And my partner was in the lead,
and he put his right hand up.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:24.517 align:middle line:84%
And then he pointed
off to his left,

00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
telling me the direction
that he'd heard it.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I pointed in
the same direction.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, deer and bears
and any other animal

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
can make that sound, that
little huffing noise.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're hunting them
and if the deer spot you,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:90%
they'll do the same thing.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.746 align:middle line:84%
They'll huff at you and then
they'll stamp their hoof down

00:28:42.746 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
thought we had.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it did it
a couple more times.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And so my partner turned
to the same direction

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:90%
and did the same sound.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Just that [LOUD BREATHS].

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And it immediately answered him.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.265 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, that's unusual.

00:28:59.265 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why another
animal would do that.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And they exchanged a
couple more of them sounds,

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and then it whistled.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it was whistled at him.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
heart just started

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.915 align:middle line:90%
beating out of my chest.

00:29:18.915 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I guessed there was no
way that a deer or anything

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
else could have whistled that
particular tone that came out

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me,
and I looked at him.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And we was just
big-eyed, and just like,

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
what we had going on there.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it went back
to the huffing noise.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>>Evolutionarily, as
we've seen, there's

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:10%
no problem evolutionarily if
this animal is Gigantopithecus.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
That's an animal
that we know walked.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Chimps and gorillas do not
appear in the fossil record,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.055 align:middle line:84%
but giant apes do appear
in the fossil record.

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The Sasquatch is sort of
like the modern gorilla.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.107 align:middle line:90%
People have heard about it.

00:29:55.107 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:10%
They've heard myths and legends.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:10%
For that's all a gorilla
was from Roman times

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:10%
until the 19th century.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.185 align:middle line:90%
It was a legend.

00:30:02.185 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a story.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>And then you can hear
something walking away.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I closed my eyes,
and you can hear it.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Just cshhht, cshhht.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Slowly moving away from us.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
After it left, my partner
come walking up to me,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and he started talking about
what had just happened.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.125 align:middle line:90%
And so we just heard this snap.

00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:32.500 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPPING SOUND]

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>Biogeographically,
there's no problem

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:84%
for Bigfoot being in North
America, because there have

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:84%
been at least two other
major colonizations of North

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and South America by primates,
the new world monkeys and Homo

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, probably through
several different colonizations

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
across the Bering land bridges
and perhaps otherwise as well.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:90%
[LOUD SNAP]

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>So we just heard this
snap, and then it came back.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
huffing again.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I heard this-- [LOUD BREATHING]

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:84%
--and he started exchanging
the huffing sounds with it,

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and then it did the
exact same whistle.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Something ran away.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We could hear
something running away.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And my partner put
his arm up and he

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:90%
start following it like that.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever was
over here did it again.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.145 align:middle line:84%
[LOUD BREATH] And I told
him, no, it's still there.

00:31:31.145 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.762 align:middle line:84%
>>Ecologically, that's
a question people ask.

00:31:41.762 --> 00:31:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
for it to eat out

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:90%
there, this great big animal?

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, posit an animal that
averages eight feet tall

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and weighs 800 or 1,000 pounds.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.740 align:middle line:84%
What's it going to
need calorifically?

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say
probably 5,000 calories

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
a day would be a
maintenance diet for it.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the equivalent
amount of food of four or five

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:90%
people, probably, to get by.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about a lot of animals

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:90%
that have to be sustained.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There are N number of
tons of mountain ash

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
berries throughout
the Dark Divide

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the
Cascades in the autumn.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Huckleberries and
whortleberries and blueberries.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're not eaten off
the vine, off the tree.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of food that
goes uneaten out there

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
by a large animal.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I do imagine an omnivore here.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Like many other primates,
it eats meat when it's able.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>You could still hear
whatever it was running away.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing drew
our attention back to it.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And then it stopped.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It got quiet.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when we raised
our hands up and slowly backed

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:90%
out of the area.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's experiences
like that that

00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
have me respecting it more, that
this thing is a living being.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It's out there,
but I'm not going

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.705 align:middle line:84%
to show that I'm
aggressive to it

00:33:05.705 --> 00:33:08.274 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm going
to cause harm to it.

00:33:08.274 --> 00:33:15.390 align:middle line:90%

time to the adventurer who

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.120 align:middle line:84%
doesn't stop at the

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:90%
into the forest.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
To me, if you're going
to look into anything,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
you should look into it
thoroughly and not just half

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's like an adventure.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's come to
me, that I've had a taste of.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
I can't let it go.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.080 align:middle line:10%
>>Back in 1967, a
series of events

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.405 align:middle line:10%
took place in the
Bluff Creek area

00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:49.405 align:middle line:10%
and the Blue Creek mountains
area of California.

00:33:49.405 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:84%
John Green and Rene
Dahinden flew down

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.015 align:middle line:84%
to look at a huge
number of footprints

00:33:55.015 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that had been found on a
road construction site.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
At this time, John
Green got in touch

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.530 align:middle line:84%
with an avid Sasquatch
researcher and author

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Roger Patterson who

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.155 align:middle line:84%
was a jack of all trades and
living in Yakima, Washington.

00:34:09.155 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
Roger and Bob Gimlin started
to organize a little expedition

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
of their own, and the two
of them set out in a bid

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:90%
to film more footprints.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:84%
This was ostensibly the
reason they went down.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.904 align:middle line:84%
And Roger rented a
16 millimeter camera.

00:34:23.904 --> 00:34:24.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
On the morning of
October 20, 1967,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Bob and Roger had a
discussion about what

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.821 align:middle line:90%
they were going to do that day.

00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And they mutually
decided that they

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
were going to return up the
Bluff Creek to look up there

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
again, just in case anything
had come back into the region.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And about 1:15 in the afternoon,
they came around a bend.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, they
were able to smell something

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.139 align:middle line:84%
that Bob Gimlin described
to me as smelling

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:90%
like a very stinky wet dog.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they looked over
to their immediate left,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.030 align:middle line:84%
they realized that they were
looking at a female Sasquatch.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Patterson, at this time, slid
off the back of his horse

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.895 align:middle line:84%
and possibly, in that moment,
damaged a stirrup and injured

00:35:06.895 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
his foot, but still had the
presence and foresight to whip

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the 16 millimeter camera out
while Bob Gimlin pulled out

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:84%
a .30-06 rifle and
held it on his lap,

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
covering Roger as he ran towards
this creature which was now

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:90%
making a beeline away from them.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And at a point, frame 352
in the film, the creature

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.966 align:middle line:84%
actually turned around
and looked at them.

00:35:26.966 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It had sort of a glare
like, you follow me

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and there are consequences.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it continued to
walk away from them.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Bob tried to continue
tracking that animal for quite

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.440 align:middle line:84%
a distance, but it
had gone up a hill,

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't conducive to ride
a horse up that hill in pursuit

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:90%
of this particular animal.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Ever since then,
that film has been

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.115 align:middle line:90%
the subject of controversy.

00:35:54.115 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Well for one thing, a group
of skeptics did look into it.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:10%
And they took the
same type of camera

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:10%
with the same lenses and
the same type of film

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:10%
and went out to the
same sort of terrain

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:10%
and attempted to
recreate the shot.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
They didn't bother putting
the person involved

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:90%
into a big hairy ape suit.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>And no one has ever done that.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.215 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:36:18.215 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:10%
The skeptics, they'll come
out and say, ah, must be this,

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:10%
must be that.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a hoax.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll accept your position,
but just don't say it.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why it's a hoax.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell me it
walks like a man

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:90%
just because it's on two feet.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The film was subsequently
taken a few years later

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.600 align:middle line:84%
by Rene Dahinden to
the Soviet Union.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And while he was there,
he visited a number

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of Russian scientists who are
absolutely beguiled by what

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing, the most
prominent being Dmitri Donskoy.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Donskoy is the man who is
responsible for preparing

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the Russian athletes for
the 1972 Olympic games,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.834 align:middle line:90%
and he was a biomechanicist.

00:36:55.834 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:84%
He knew everything
about stride lengths.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
He knew about how
the muscles work

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and how people
walk and locomode.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The minute he saw the photograph
of this creature, just

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
a photograph, he
said to Dahinden,

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:84%
he says, I know how
that thing walks.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And he replicated, awkwardly
like a human would,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:84%
this unnatural gait
of this creature.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.284 align:middle line:84%
And then when he ran
the film, he pointed out

00:37:16.284 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to Dahinden right
away, this thing

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:90%
doesn't walk like a human being.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.070 align:middle line:84%
When a human being
walks, our knees lock.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:84%
This thing walks
with its knees bent,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
which indicates a huge
stride when it walks.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>How do you walk
and lift your feet

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:84%
perfectly vertical
to the ground--

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:84%
the toes straight down,
the heel straight up--

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and do it and keep
that center of gravity

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:84%
moving where you do
it so smoothly it's

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:90%
like a natural walk for you?

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>This is considered
by many to be

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:84%
some of the best evidence
for Sasquatch there ever was.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what
I have here, it's

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:84%
a full size frame from the
Patterson film, approximately

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
life size, give or
take an inch or two.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, this is
a very, very big creature.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm 6 feet 5, weigh
about 225 pounds.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You can see her body density
is much larger than mine.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You'll also notice that the
mouth is far lower on her face

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:84%
than it is on
mine, for instance.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
You will also notice that
this creature has breasts.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that would have been a
tremendous creative streak

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Roger Patterson
constructing a gorilla

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:84%
suit, as it were,
with breasts built in.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not impossible
to do, but why would

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:84%
you do that when
the story of Bigfoot

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:84%
pretty much was built on a
foundation of a male Sasquatch,

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:90%
rather than female?

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:84%
We can also see down
here on the thigh

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that there appears
to be a hernia.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Athletes get
herniated muscles,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and the hernia, when the muscle
reaches a certain extension,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:90%
causes it to bulge.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>The hernia moves
in perfect harmony

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:84%
with the contraction
of the femur muscle

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
as the creature is
walking in the film.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.674 align:middle line:84%
>>And they believe
that's what that

00:38:51.674 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
is, something you wouldn't be
able to attribute to a suit.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Janos Prohaska, who is well
known back in the '50s '60s

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and '70s for his
ape costume, said,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and I quote, "if this
is a man in a costume,

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
then every single hair
was glued to his body.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you would never
have seen those muscles."

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>I've read all the
accounts and its dismissal,

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm not convinced
by any of them.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:10%
I still feel that the evidence--
that what we call evidence,

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.841 align:middle line:10%
the canon of evidence should
include the Patterson Gimlin

00:39:27.841 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:10%
film.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>People say, that's proven
to have been a hoax, right?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it hasn't
been proven, but that's

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:90%
the perception out there.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:10%
So I don't raise
that film anymore.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.220 align:middle line:90%
It's very sad.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But raising it as
evidence just gets you

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
into a discussion about he
says, she says, and claims

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:90%
and counterclaims.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we should just put
that film aside for now,

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
get on with the really
hard evidence, especially

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:84%
the tracks, and
then one day that we

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.170 align:middle line:84%
can bring that film
back and say, well,

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
what we now know about
the Sasquatch is there

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:90%
in that film.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>In the 19th century, we were
finding a lot of new species.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.132 align:middle line:90%
We were cataloging them.

00:40:10.132 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But in the 20th
century, we haven't

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:90%
found a lot of new species.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The pygmy chimpanzee was
discovered in the 1920s,

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:84%
but since there
really hasn't been

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.205 align:middle line:84%
much big mammals or
big animals discovered.

00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And to postulate that
there's this great ape that's

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:84%
7 or 8 feet tall that we
still haven't classified

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.889 align:middle line:84%
scientifically, to
many minds, just

00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fit with that
pattern of discovery.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>My biologist
colleagues just love

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.831 align:middle line:84%
to discover the presence of a
new small mammal or a new bird

00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:39.330 align:middle line:90%
in an area.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we sort
of thrive on that.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.029 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have something,
but this is too big a discovery.

00:40:45.029 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a professional
colleague at a university

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
say this to me one time.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, but John, if
this thing existed,

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
it would be the zoological
discovery of the century.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of left it
hanging as if to say,

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and of course that
can't be, can it?

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Scientists, they
pick a project

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.844 align:middle line:84%
and they get expert
at that project.

00:41:04.844 --> 00:41:07.385 align:middle line:84%
Say a physical anthropologist
specializes in Gigantopithecus.

00:41:07.385 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to branch
off and say, oh, there's

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:84%
something a little bit
more interesting over here

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and take that on.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.465 align:middle line:90%
A scientist is a specialist.

00:41:17.465 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>They're unanimous
when they say

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:84%
what they need is a body
or piece of the body.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else will do.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So that means an animal
has to be brought in.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Now that means that
one has to be shot,

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.977 align:middle line:84%
and that means that that's
exactly what has to happen.

00:41:32.977 --> 00:41:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we need the hard
physical evidence to prove that

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the animal is real.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Roger Patterson stated that
he regretted that they'd not

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.250 align:middle line:84%
shot the animal, and he
never wanted to do that.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's a rare animal.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But he took a lot of
ridicule, him and Bob Gimlin.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And it frustrates
me, but I understand

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.264 align:middle line:84%
that scientists do
need concrete evidence.

00:42:01.264 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
even necessarily

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:90%
have to kill the animal.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I think if you can just
get DNA of some sort,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it be hair or
whatever, then you've

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.440 align:middle line:84%
got a step in the
right direction.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.815 align:middle line:84%
At least they have
to acknowledge

00:42:10.815 --> 00:42:12.730 align:middle line:84%
there's an unknown
primate running around.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>My experience from
talking to hunters

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
is that those
hunters who have had

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a Sasquatch in their cross
hairs, in their gun sights,

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:84%
have not been able
to pull the trigger.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:90%
They've seen an animal.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.200 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's not
what they're hunting.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.908 align:middle line:90%
It's not a moose.

00:42:27.908 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not a deer.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a bear.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Second, it is very human-like.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Apes are very human-like.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
about to kill one.

>>What we're all saying, I
think we're all agreeing on,

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.375 align:middle line:84%
is that Bigfoot's not
just another animal.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>This animal hasn't
been in a zoo.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.800 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been shot and killed
and brought before science.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.035 align:middle line:90%
It's not sitting in a museum.

00:42:52.035 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate wild
animal for my area.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not harming anybody.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I made sure that I
don't harm anything.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.194 align:middle line:84%
And I've thought
about it, you know.

00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
If I do find a Bigfoot, what
am I going to do with it?

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Do I want one
sitting in the zoo?

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I sit there at the zoo and study
these gorillas all the time.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least two or three
times a month, I go to the zoo

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:90%
and watch them.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And they look sad.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't look like
they want to be there.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And if I saw a
Bigfoot in it, helped

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:84%
get one of those
creatures inside of a zoo,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I would be-- I don't know.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.611 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.611 --> 00:43:39.610 align:middle line:90%
That is not what I want.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a story
that the Yakamas have

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:90%
that they're part of us.

00:43:49.706 --> 00:43:52.330 align:middle line:84%
That there were three groups of
people here on the reservation.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
There were the big people,
there were the Yakamas,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and then there were
the little people.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And during the European
migration in this direction,

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.260 align:middle line:84%
the Yakamas kind of got
curious of the new tools

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and new trinkets coming
across and they moved down

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to the valleys while the
big people want nothing

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:90%
to do with it.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The Yakamas tried to go back
up into the high country

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and rejoin them
but were told that

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:26.024 align:middle line:84%
to if they wanted to continue
with what they were seeing,

00:44:26.024 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:84%
then they were not
allowed to come back.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.430 align:middle line:90%

>>Bigfoot I've often
heard described

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:84%
as sort of a symbol of
green spirituality, a symbol

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:84%
of our lost connection
with the wilderness

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and with the sort of environment
in which we used to live.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.750 align:middle line:84%
A sort of oneness with
nature that we're losing.

still living like they

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.750 align:middle line:90%
were before what we have here.

00:45:07.357 --> 00:45:08.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find
that they're going

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to be extinct a lot
faster than they would

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.240 align:middle line:84%

Bigfoot is an animal

and presumably to one another.

And with what we
could imagine, or call

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary humility, this
would be an upright ape which

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:84%
wasn't trying to
dominate the world,

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.099 align:middle line:84%

every other species,

Keep with what you're doing.

Maybe not quite as it
should, but a certain amount

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.710 align:middle line:84%
of this resistance was just
normal, natural scientific

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

apes out in the forest,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.230 align:middle line:84%
if our hearts become so
jaded that we can't even

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.950 align:middle line:84%
imagine mysteries
out there, then we've

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.670 align:middle line:84%
lost something
absolutely profound.

it does, and treat its habitat,
treat the ecosystem as if it

and sustain this animal,

we will have gained
something great and grand,
