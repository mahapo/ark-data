00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:08.964 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I lived a very
normal American life.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on a small
farm up in the mountains.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:90%
We had cows and horses.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was a family of boys.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I had all brothers, so I grew
up in a very rough and tumble

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:90%
We worked hard.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:90%
We played hard.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And we had a lot of fun.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:84%
My brothers and I
were very close.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.655 align:middle line:90%
I was the middle one.

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I had a younger brother
and an older brother,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
but we were all within
about four years.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So we were very, very close.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of sports, a lot
of football, things like that.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So we were very active.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Then my mother was
a devout Christian.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
She and my father had
split up, but I grew up

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
with that conservative
Christian background.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
For me, there was
always this stirring,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I suppose, about what is real?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is truth?

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember as a boy
going out into the fields.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was dark.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
You would see the stars
at night, you know?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could look
up at the stars.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I went away to
college, actually,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:90%
to play American football.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I had a scholarship to do that.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:10%
But I also wanted
to be an artist,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:10%
so I was studying
art and playing

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:10%
football on the other side.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I was 19, 20, 21.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.265 align:middle line:84%
And while I was away
at college, that's--

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
probably the most
important thing

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.035 align:middle line:84%
happened is I fell madly
head over heels in love.

00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I met a young
woman named Tamara.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And gosh, my heart just knew.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't
even know her name.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
She walked in the room, and
it was like lightning hit me.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like, there she is.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And we became beautiful friends.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had a friendship, and
it turned into a relationship,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and it turned into a courtship.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we were
eventually married.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Tamara was a schoolteacher.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
She taught high school,
the upper levels.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was a marketing person.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I graduated and got my
degree in marketing.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were pursuing
our careers.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And we had our first
child, a little son.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
We called him Spencer.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he was a joy.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
We enjoyed raising
our little boy.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And Tamara said, let's
have more children.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But there had been
complications.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But six years after the fact
came Griffin, a second child.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, we had these
two boys, beautiful family.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But everything changed, really,
with the near-death experience.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was a result of a
horrific automobile accident.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget it.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been 20 years now
since the accident happened,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
but I can recall the details
like it was yesterday.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We were on a family
vacation, actually.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It was the Easter weekend.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:90%
We'd been away.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We had been visiting
Tamara's parents.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
We had had a beautiful
Easter weekend.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And Monday came, and it was
time for me to get back to work,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
so we loaded
everyone in the car.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'd been down in Southern
Utah in the red rock country

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and we were driving up to
north Utah where we live.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain moments of
that that I'll never forget.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like time stood
still, especially in hindsight.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had put
everyone in the car.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we were just
getting ready to pull away.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:90%
I had just put the car in drive.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And Tamara reached
over and said, oh wait.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Wait just a minute.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to go say goodbye to
mom and dad one more time.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Which at the time, I thought,
gosh, we said goodbye.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:90%
You know, let's get on the road.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But I put the car in
park and I watched.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:90%
She went up to the porch.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:10%
She not only hugged
her mother and father,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:10%
but she also kissed them both.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And then she came back
to the car quite happy,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
got in, buckled in her seatbelt.
We got on the interstate.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I put the car on cruise
control, went up to 75

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
miles per hour, which was as
fast as I could legally go.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I was hurrying to get back
to work in the office.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And it was a half day drive.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a four to five hour
drive that we were making.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And even during that process,
I was racing down the road.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about all
the things I had to do at work

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and going on and on.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Tamara had actually laid
her seat back to have a nap.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just peeked in
the rearview mirror.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I noticed Griffin, my youngest
son, just barely learning

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
to walk and talk.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw this little boy, and
I thought what a miracle.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We were told we may not
have any more children,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
and there he is, beautiful.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
glanced behind me

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
where Spencer, who was
seven years old at the time,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
he was playing with
little action figures

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:90%
and making all kinds of noise.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought what a
joyful little boy.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I then glanced at Tamara,
who was sleeping but holding

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:90%
my hand.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
wow, I'm so lucky.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what I felt.
I had this moment

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
of just absolute gratitude.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm so lucky for what I have.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was about
an hour after that

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
that it got really, really bad.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:90%
There was heavy winds.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
There was reports
of a pickup truck

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that was driving
erratically on the highway.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part about the
story and the experience

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:90%
is I really--

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I believe I dozed off.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'd been
driving long, and I

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
think I maybe just nodded off
at the wheel for a minute.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But when I did that, the
car swerved to the right.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I overcorrected to the left,
and I lost control of the car.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And then it began to roll.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it rolled not off the
road, but down the road

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
at 75 miles an hour
on the concrete.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrific
automobile accident.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The police reports
say the car probably

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
rolled six to eight times.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I blacked out for most of that.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall actually rolling.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But when the car came to a stop,
I was incredibly conscious.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm like, oh
my gosh, what happened?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I was aware of

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
was Spencer, my seven-year-old,
crying in the back seat.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Just crying hysterically.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a father, I
thought, OK, well, he's OK.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get to my son.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get to my boy.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But that's when I realized
that I could not move.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I was pinned.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't tell
if I was pinned

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:90%
to the seat or the floorboard.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I was disoriented.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
I was struggling to breathe.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
There was excruciating pain.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea of my injuries.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
What had actually happened
is that both of my legs

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:90%
had been crushed and shattered.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The left leg was actually
amputated above the knee.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
My back had been injured.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
My rib cage was injured, and
my lungs were collapsing.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
My right arm had
almost been torn off.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It was severed really
badly and all the muscles

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
had been torn out of the socket.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the seat belt
cut through my midsection

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and had ruptured my
intestines, my insides.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
All I knew is that
my son was crying.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get to him.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
brutal reality hit

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:90%
that no one else was crying.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
That's when I
thought, oh my gosh.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And I knew.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I knew Tamara is gone.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw, which I don't
talk a lot about--

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Tamara, because she
had laid her seat

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
back was not restrained
properly by the seat belt.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so she had suffered some
pretty severe head trauma

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.600 align:middle line:84%
in the accident
which took her life.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Griffin, my little boy,
the car seat had broken up,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and he had been
ejected from the car.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:10%
And so I couldn't see him.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's like I
knew in my heart.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it was the darkest,
most awful feeling of,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
they're gone.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And I-- suddenly the
guilt. I mean, the regret.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I just kept thinking,
can't I just take back

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:90%
that five seconds?

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happened?

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:90%
How did I crash the car?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:90%
It was absolute panic.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And Spencer is
crying hysterically.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was attempting
to speak to him.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was losing
consciousness.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But I said to Spencer, I
said, it's going to be OK.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's a lie.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, half the family's gone.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing consciousness.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing will ever be the same.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was in that
darkest moment,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it was in that turmoil,
that horror of the accident

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that I felt, well, the
best word is light.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like, light came.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like I felt light
come and circle around me.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Almost like it was a blanket.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
Almost like it was comforting
me in this horrific moment.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And it felt as if I was
rising above the scene

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:90%
of the accident.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The best word is maybe like
in this bubble of light.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And I rose above the accident.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now I can breathe.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- the pain's gone.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
asking, is am I OK?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I realized
that Tamara, who I knew

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:84%
was gone at the scene, she was
there with me and very much

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:90%
alive.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And gorgeous.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.238 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
only reason I share

00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
her in the accident,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because all of a
sudden she was there.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.313 align:middle line:90%
And there was no injuries.

00:09:14.313 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:90%
There was no head trauma.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
She was radiant and
beautiful and glorious.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:90%
She was upset and frantic.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:84%
She's like, Jeff, Jeff,
you've got to go back.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go back.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You can't come.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
You can't be here.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
There I was looking at the
woman I loved more than life.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew I had
a little boy crying

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in the backseat of that car.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had to make a
choice about coming back.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It was so real.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't
like a dream at all.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like my
senses were multiplied.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in this state, if
I can see and smell and taste

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and hear and all those
things, in that state

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:90%
it was super sensory.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It was so real that it
makes this life feel

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
like the foggy dream.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like this feels like the
weird, strange, dreamy state.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:90%
That was reality.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her, and I
thought, I've got to go back.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I can't leave our
little boy orphaned.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I literally got to say goodbye.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I made the
choice to come back.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't have to
figure out how do I go back?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
It was in the intention.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It was in the intention of
thinking, I'm going back.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:10%
As I did so, I found myself
wandering around a hospital.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have no concept of
time in this bubble of light.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know how many
minutes or hours went by.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I later found out
that people arrived

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
at the scene of the accident.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
One happened to
be a doctor, which

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
was able to do some emergency
procedures, care for Spencer.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They rushed us to
a local hospital.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And Spencer was not badly
hurt, my seven-year-old.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
He was banged up a little bit,
but he basically physically

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:90%
walked away from the accident.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But emotionally, he thought
the whole family was gone.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
With the extent of
my injuries, there's

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:84%
no way that hospital
could see to my care.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
They had to life flight
me to a level one trauma

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:90%
center, which they did.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
They flew me to the
nearest metropolitan city

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
where I could get
the care I needed.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
about any of that.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was I
had wrecked the car.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I had said the most profound
goodbye I would ever say.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.335 align:middle line:84%
And there I was wandering
around through a hospital,

00:11:27.335 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
looking at the nurses,
and the doctors,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and the patients, and the
families of the patients.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But the incredible thing is
everybody I saw, I knew them.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, they were strangers,
but I would look at them

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and I knew everything
about them.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I knew their love, their hate,
their joy, their decisions,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:90%
their pain, their motivations.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.701 align:middle line:90%
I knew them as if they were me.

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It was intense things.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I felt-- there was a
nurse, and I just, I

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
knew that she had been abused as
a child, physically, sexually,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought--
well, I could feel it

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:90%
as if it had happened to me.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But in feeling it, I had this
profound compassion for her.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh wow, look
what she has overcome.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Look what she endured.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
intense feeling of look

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:90%
who she is now because of that.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
This compassionate
medical staff, literally

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
healing people.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:10%
I had this intense
connection to everyone.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was this sense
of love for everyone.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter who they
were or what they had done

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or what they hadn't done.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them as
this incredible soul.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
All those judgments from
religion just went away.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It was like, aren't
they incredible?

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.697 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they beautiful?

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I did have a verse,
like from the Bible,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
come up as I'm wandering
around the hospital.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous verse
attributed to Jesus

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that says "inasmuch
as you've done it

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
under the least of these,
you've done it unto me",

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
which I used to think was a
really nice passage about being

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
nice to people.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Which I suppose it is.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But I was feeling it at
such an intense level.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I realized, wow.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.262 align:middle line:84%
So what Jesus was saying is
I am them and they are me.

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was experiencing.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I was them and they were me.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was this oneness, this
connection that was undeniable.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was the heroin addict.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:90%
I was the nurse.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I was all of it.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I was everything, and
everything was me.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But it was all encircled
in this intense love

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and this intense compassion,
unconditional love.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was just marveling
at this experience

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
until I came up to a man, or
a body laying on the gurney

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't feel anything
from, which I thought

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.870 align:middle line:90%
was weird.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I stepped
closer and took a look,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I realized,
oh my goodness, that's me.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't me.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I was having this incredible
connected experience,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:90%
but there was my body.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
There was that skin suit that
I had been wearing around life.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredibly sad,
because my body was a wreck.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I've taken for granted that
I'm healthy and can run

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and be athletic and feel good.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was
my body so broken.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
A couple of things were
huge for me in that.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
I'm not my body.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I was something far greater.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And then also, I had peace,
even in the trauma of everything

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that had happened, by being
out of this situation.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I also realized too
that passing, I mean dying,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:90%
was very natural.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It was very beautiful.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Many might say that I suffered
a very violent, traumatic death

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
in the car accident
and all the injuries

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.735 align:middle line:84%
and everything
that had happened.

00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't even
aware of the injuries.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew I've
got to get back in.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get back in
that body and carry on.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I've got to live for my son.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And once again, there
was no figuring it out.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%
It was intention.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back in.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.978 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, I
was back in the body.

00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I went back into
the body, the heaviness

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and the regret, the guilt, the
pain, the trauma, all of that.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the hospital
for almost six months.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was awful
to be back in the body.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I was ventilated.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a big tube down my
throat doing the breathing

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
since my lungs had collapsed.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
My legs were obviously immobile.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
My right arm was immobile.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
tied down my left arm

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
because I kept grabbing at
all the medical equipment.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.995 align:middle line:90%
It was really intense.

00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was
almost like I had

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:84%
one foot in this realm and
one foot in that realm.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I would find myself
leaving the body every now

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and then.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.855 align:middle line:84%
I would feel like,
gosh, I need a break.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And there was
times I felt like I

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.718 align:middle line:84%
was over in the corner
watching it all,

00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
just taking a break from
it all, knowing I've got

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to get back in the body again.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would go in
and out of the body.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I also had-- it was like
continued communication

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
with Tamara, my wife.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I recall having a very intense
conversation with her when

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:90%
I was out of the body again.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was letting me
know what she wanted

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:90%
done at the funeral services.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted
her sister in-laws

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:90%
to have her fancy dresses.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted her
cousin and her niece

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to have those special
rings and the jewelry.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was almost
trivial things.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:90%
But she was communicating to me.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most profound
thing that happened

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
was at the end of
my hospital stay.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:10%
I was out of ICU, and I
was in ICU for months,

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and then I would go
to surgical recovery.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I had horrible infections.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I had pneumonia in my lungs.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I kept throwing
pulmonary embolisms.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They're blood clots that
lodge in your lungs.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was very sick
for a very long time.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But by this case, I was out of
ICU, out of surgical recovery.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in the
rehabilitation unit

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.619 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was only weeks
before I was to come home.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I finally was able to
roll and sleep on my side.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:90%
And I remember falling asleep.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the guilt, the
grief, the pain, the trauma,

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
everything that I'd
been dealing with.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:30.675 align:middle line:84%
And while I was sleeping, I
felt that light come again,

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
just like at the
scene of the accident.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I felt this
blanket of light.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And although I was
joyful to be sleeping,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the grief and the guilt. I
mean, I'd lost half my family.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I had lost half my body.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I was worried about
my son, and how was he

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:90%
going to deal with this?

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:90%
How was I going to deal with it?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
So there was a constant worry.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:90%
But I was peaceful in my sleep.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And this light came
and embraced me

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and was comforting me
just like at the accident

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in those situations.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And again, I felt a lift.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the light
seemed to dispense,

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
like a fog or a
mist that goes away.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:90%
The light was gone.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the most
incredibly beautiful place.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was so real.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Once again, it was so sensory.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that might seem
odd that it felt physical,

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
but I was running.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
ground beneath my feet.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the warmth and
the energy from the ground

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
beneath my feet.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And I began to run.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And it felt as if I was running.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could feel,
you know, the muscles

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:90%
in my calves and thighs.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was joyfully,
joyfully running.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's odd.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
What was coming to my mind
is, wow, it's good to be home.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:90%
I was home.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people say
heaven, or the other side.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:90%
To me, I was home.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:90%
It was so familiar.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It was so welcoming.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I was so joyful to be there.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I say it felt
like a physical experience,

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:90%
everything was super sensory.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I could taste the colors.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I could smell what I was seeing.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was elated to be there.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I got this message.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It was like a knowledge,
like a knowing

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:90%
that you're not here to stay.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, I just
want to stay, you know?

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
About the time I got
that message there was

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:90%
this corridor off to my left.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I knew intuitively
I'm to go down there.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And I made my way
down the corridor.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, I
could see something

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the corridor.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I made my way to
the end of the corridor.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
there, it was a crib,

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:84%
much like the one Griffin had
been sleeping in, because he

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:90%
was still just a baby.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I raced to the crib, and
I looked in the crib.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And there was Griffin.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:90%
There was my little boy.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was sleeping as
peacefully and as beautifully

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
as when I had peeked in the rear
view mirror on the ride home.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And I swept him up in my arms.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had worried and
had pain over that,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because I knew he had
been thrown from the car.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what had happened,

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:90%
but I knew he had been killed.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:90%
But there he was, perfect.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I swept
him up-- and again,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
it was so physical
what I could feel.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the
heat from his body.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, he's OK.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel him breathing.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I could feel his
rib cage expanding.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I could feel his
breath on my neck.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, he's OK.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
He's just fine.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.573 align:middle line:90%
And then I smelled his hair.

00:20:36.573 --> 00:20:39.115 align:middle line:84%
You know, I smelled his hair
and thought, it's my little boy.

00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He's perfect.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:90%
He's OK.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel him
solid against me.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was even marveling then.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
If I'm out of the body, how
does it feel so physical?

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I could feel, and smell, and
taste, and touch everything.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I began to weep just
thinking, oh, he's OK.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was holding him.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And I had longed for
that over those months.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And as I was holding him, I felt
an intense feeling behind me.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a presence.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It felt so cosmic, so
big, so wise, so powerful.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And I began to become fearful.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my thoughts
were, that's God.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I am in the presence of God.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I begin to have
those guilt feelings again.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I was holding my
little boy thinking,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
he died because I
crashed the car.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
He's here because I messed
up and lost control.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And I began to think,
well, my thought was,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm forgiven.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I hope some way I
can be forgiven for--

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did I take the
life of my little boy?

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was the
guilt. It was very deep.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I was weeping and
holding him, and feeling

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
this presence come behind,
and as I had that thought,

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:84%
suddenly this presence
came so close.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And this felt physical too.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt these loving arms
wrap around and hold us.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And the message just came
as powerful as could be.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.335 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to forgive.

00:22:06.335 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
pure divine order.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.288 align:middle line:90%
Everything is OK.

00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
like there was just

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
this download of truth and
knowledge and love and peace.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And all those misconceptions
I had about God,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was being tested,
that I was probably failing,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that I was going
to be judged, those

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
were swept away in pure,
unconditional love.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
There are not even
words for the love

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that I felt as I was
wrapped in those arms.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like me and my
little boy became part of that.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Like we became God.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I was seeing
everything differently.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I saw my life.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I saw my
parents get divorced,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and the insecurities
that created in me.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the relationship
with my brothers

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.453 align:middle line:84%
and the things
that had happened.

00:22:58.453 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And I saw things that I thought,
well, that was a mistake.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.553 align:middle line:90%
That was a mistake.

00:23:02.553 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But in those loving arms,
it was just flowing.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:90%
There are no mistakes.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything's in perfect order.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I saw things that, like,
I knew they were wrong,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
but I did them anyway.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
oh, don't-- you know.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And there was so much love.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
All that was flowing through me
is look how much we love you.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Look how much we
honor your choices.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Look how much we
honor your life.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was being told or I was--

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:90%
I say told.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.685 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't with words.

00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:84%
It was just pure energy
that everything was perfect.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Even that my life was perfect.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
That everything
happened for a reason,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that I was learning
in every instance.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And that actually,
that I was perfect.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.053 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- that
would blow my mind.

00:23:45.053 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, how
could I be perfect?

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But there was also
this oneness in that.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
If I was perfect, then
everyone else was perfect too.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
in divine order.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.188 align:middle line:84%
And I also felt as
if I was divine.

00:23:58.188 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, it's almost
like we became God.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It felt like I'm a divine soul.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm a divine being of light
having this crazy life

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
experience that my
soul might expand.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And yet, none of it is real.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
That's just the stage of a play
or something I'm going through.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:90%
It's an experience I'm having.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, I learned
about choice again.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I was told that I could be
angry at God my whole life,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and think that he
took my family away,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
or that somehow
life was not fair.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And that was OK.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
There was no
judgment whatsoever.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I could do that.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:10%
But the beautiful thing is
I was given another choice.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:10%
And it was that I
could exercise my will.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I could give Griffin--

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I could give my son back to
God, back to the universe.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.562 align:middle line:84%
And then my will
would be part of it.

00:24:48.562 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That I could make
a choice in that,

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and I could literally let go.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In all that love, and
in all that peace,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and in all that beauty, I was
able to kiss my little boy

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and give him back.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up back
in the hospital bed,

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
back to the amputation,
the injuries, you know,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:90%
all that had happened.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had a little bit
different perspective realizing

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:90%
everything's a choice.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that everything
is in divine order.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And that if I'm perfect,
then everyone's perfect.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to judge
anyone for anything.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that life's
actually perfect,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:84%
if I could literally reach
out and embrace it that way.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's interesting that
these two things happened when

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I was not on heavy narcotics.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And they're so real.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's been 20 years.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.472 align:middle line:84%
But I can remember them
like they were yesterday.

00:25:43.472 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember what
happened in the hospital.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember when
I moved from ICU to--

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
all of that is foggy.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual
things that happened,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
the out of body
things that happened

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:90%
were like they were yesterday.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget them.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And it changed me.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want
any misconceptions.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult. I mean, it
wasn't like I wrecked the car,

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I had these incredible
experiences, and then I was OK.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I was a wreck for
almost 10 years.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was grieving.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I was hurt.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I missed my family.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I missed my leg.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I missed all of it.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Spencer, my little
seven-year-old.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:90%
How difficult for him.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:90%
He lost everything I did.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:90%
He didn't lose his leg.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:90%
But he lost his mother.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:90%
He lost his brother.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
He, in many ways,
lost his father.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Coming home to him was very
difficult. Because I thought,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to do this?

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, first of
all, I was in a wheelchair.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And this leg was chopped off.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
My right leg was
still in a big brace

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
holding it out straight
so it would heal.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.905 align:middle line:84%
My right arm was
in a sling, and I

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:84%
had a little electric
wheelchair that I could

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:90%
drive with my one good hand.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I returned home.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I was going
out into the world.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We were going to have to go
to the market, and to school,

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I was
really worried about him.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The day I came home
was interesting.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I share this for
a specific reason.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
My brothers, who
were incredible,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't imagine what I
would have done without family

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and friends in this situation.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:10%
But my brothers were--

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:10%
they almost lost their jobs
to be at the hospital with me

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:10%
to see me through.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:10%
They came to get me when
it was time to go home.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:10%
They'd have to lift me
into the wheelchair,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:10%
and put me and lift
me into the car.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And they drove me home.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a ramp that
had been installed so I

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:90%
could get in the front door.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And I saw Spencer,
my seven-year-old,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.515 align:middle line:84%
watching out the window as
my brothers, his uncles,

00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
were lifting me out of
the car and putting me

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:90%
in the wheelchair.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how is he
going to deal with this?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:90%
And then he did run.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And he finally threw himself on
my lap, which just about killed

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:84%
me, because I still had all
the sutures down from when

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:90%
they put my insides together.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:90%
And he threw his arms around me.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And I had a huge epiphany.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:10%
I realized that
sitting in a wheelchair

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:10%
and holding my surviving
son in this realm

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:10%
was no less divine than
being in the other realm

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:10%
and holding my son
who had passed there.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.497 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suddenly heaven, if
you will, was right here.

00:28:10.497 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there was nowhere to go.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing to be.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:90%
There was these divine moments.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's never gone away.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for 20 years
now-- and yeah, I

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.750 align:middle line:90%
had to get back to work.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I had to make a life.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's those
little moments in life

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that are just-- they're divine.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like something opens
up and your heart gets it.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:90%
I had miracles happen.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I say I
had angels show up.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those angels
were my brothers or my mom.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was neighbors.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But I felt as if
there was always

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:90%
angels from the other side.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like Griffin and
Tamara never really were gone.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I eventually fell in love
again, which was crazy.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was--

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:90%
I had guilt about that.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I think I have a guilt complex.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had this incredible
woman come into my life, Tonya.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:90%
She's my wife now.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't dating.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I was still bereaved.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.310 align:middle line:90%
I was still heartbroken.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But I began to have
feelings for her.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And I felt awful.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the graveyard and
I would lay on my wife's grave.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was sobbing, saying--

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:90%
well, I was angry at one point.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how could
you leave me like this?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
even walk right.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to raise our son.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're in that
beautiful place.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And how dare you?

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%
How dare you leave me?

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was angry.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:10%
And it was interesting, because
as I was pouring out my heart

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:10%
and letting her have it
with my words, I felt her.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't see,
but I felt her.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if she came and
put her hands on my shoulders

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:90%
behind me.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And then she
communicated so clearly.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:84%
She was like, don't
berate me for leaving.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:01.716 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, she said,
I loved you enough to leave.

00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:90%
But that can't be right.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:84%
That can't-- you know,
that doesn't make sense.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And she communicated.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
She said you would not be
learning what you're learning.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Life would be so different.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved nothing
more than to grow old with you

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and be with you.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
But that was not the plan.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And she laid out-- like,
this was a big plan.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We made this deal that
you were going to come.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.030 align:middle line:84%
You were going to
have this experience.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And that I was going to love you
enough to go so that you would

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
have those feelings and have
your soul expand in such a way.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And none of this
really made sense.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't fight
fair, and I said, yeah,

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
but I'm having feelings
for another woman.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:90%
And she laughed at me.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:90%
She said, of course you are.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Of course you are.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be happy.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I want you to have love.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be with someone.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I am not jealous.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not upset.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hurt.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she communicated,
I sent her your way.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:90%
You can do whatever you want.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You have the choice.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But she will teach you
unconditional love.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was so real.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.413 align:middle line:84%
Once again, that
was so real to me.

00:31:08.413 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I could hear the
voice in my head.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:90%
But I could feel it in my heart.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the communication
was so clear.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel her there.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though I didn't
feel her physically,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I could feel her
right there with me.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was life
changing as well.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually
remarried, you know.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Tonya and I
continued our relationship.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And Spencer embraced
her as a mother.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Tonya is the hero of the story.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she came in and
continued to heal a broken man,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:90%
because I was broken.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And she took Spencer
on as her son

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:10%
and kind of put all the
pieces back together for us.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And then we adopted two boys.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Tonya was not able
to have children.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think
we should adopt.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
say adopted boys.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:90%
I just called them my sons.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We adopted two boys
that are brothers.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And they came as a
package deal to our home.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But I just say my sons
made it to our house.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.540 align:middle line:90%
It looked a little different.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:84%
We rebuilt this family,
but it was still hard.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
You know, it wasn't--

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it took me 10 years
to really get over the grief,

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:90%
to really embrace love.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
key for me, too, is

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
even though I had had
those profound experiences,

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I was still looking for joy
and peace out there somewhere.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Who can bring this to me?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Tonya, if she could just love
me enough to make me feel OK.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Or if the boys could just love
me enough to make me feel OK.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Or in my job or whatever
else I was grasping at

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to feel like I was wanted
and I was loved and I was OK.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had been in the
arms of God and felt perfect.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.398 align:middle line:84%
But I was still looking
for an outside source.

00:32:50.398 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was wandering
around thinking, where's

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
all that love I felt here?

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Where will I ever find it?

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:10%
And the key was when I
finally looked within myself

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:10%
instead of looking out there.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
When I finally realized,
oh, to love unconditionally,

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I get to love myself
unconditionally.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened,
the healing began.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I was never going
to find it out there.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:90%
That had to be felt within.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And even in my
Christian upbringing,

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:84%
this Jesus fellow said "the
kingdom of God is within you".

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't look out there for it.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I began to maybe grasp
what that meant a little

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:90%
more, that it is within us.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.220 align:middle line:90%
We are divine beings.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We do have the power to create
our own situations if we

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:84%
embrace ourselves
that way and do so.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
For many years, I didn't talk
about my experience at all.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want people
to think I was crazy.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, I felt
it was just for me.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is sacred stuff.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not lunchtime
conversation to say,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
hey, by the way, I went to
the other side and saw God.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I just held
it to my own self.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.222 align:middle line:90%
I didn't share about it.

00:34:05.222 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't talk about it.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
Very few people even knew
that I had had an experience.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was talking to
a group of people.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- actually, it
was a Sunday school class.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching a class.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
And the subject was
the love of God.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to get
emotional, saying, oh, I

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:90%
have felt the love of God.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't hold
back the emotions,

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.781 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking
of being in those arms.

00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:31.739 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman in
the back that came up.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:32.539 align:middle line:90%
And I knew her.

00:34:32.539 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:90%
She was a neighbor of ours.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's a
lot more to your experience

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
you don't talk about, right?

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, but
I don't talk about it.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think you should
meet with a person I know.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was a man
at the university

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
who studied near death or
out of body experiences.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, no, I don't--

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and she said, please do this.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down with him and
shared what had happened.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And of course I'm just weeping.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't talked of it much.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And he was crying too.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.853 align:middle line:84%
And when I finished,
there was someone

00:35:03.853 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%
in the back that was with a
publishing company and came up

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.812 align:middle line:84%
and said, you've
got to write a book.

00:35:07.812 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't even talk about
this, let alone write a book.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:10%
And, well, there was so many
things falling into place.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
little whisper.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I call it a whisper.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:84%
That was saying, maybe
that's why you're still here.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really not
about me, you know?

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about healing.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And if I can do
something that makes

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
a difference in the world with
the catastrophe that happened,

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:90%
then that makes it worth it.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Then that makes it in
some ways OK, or at least

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much
division in the world.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Everything teaches us
that we're separate.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:90%
You're of that political party.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm of this one.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.960 align:middle line:90%
You're woman and I'm a man.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Or you're gay and I'm straight.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Or you're Black and I'm white.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Or, I mean, there's all this
segregation, all this division.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.240 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that was so
profound in my experience

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:84%
was the oneness, realizing
that we are connected.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:84%
That I am and you are
me, and that we're really

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:90%
here together.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.630 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
There's no stepchildren
in this family of God.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And also the love.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The love I felt. I
have embraced that love

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful
force in the universe.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Love can heal everything.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And it can heal anything if
we can simply come together.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, too,
I embrace that as well.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used
to live in a fear

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.582 align:middle line:84%
that the world was
going to end, or God

00:36:35.582 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:90%
was going to come and fix it.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm a firm believer
that it's up to us.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.520 align:middle line:84%
That we're divine,
powerful beings.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that if we can embrace that
love that is within each of us

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.220 align:middle line:84%
by loving ourselves
and then loving others,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:90%
that that's the ripple effect.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.047 align:middle line:84%
That's what creates
heaven right here.

00:36:53.047 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's nowhere
to go or anything to be.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It's to really embrace
and love each other here.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, that
beautiful place

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
becomes the ground
under our own feet.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:84%
The oneness, the
connection that we have.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter who said it.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
There's been many
masters, you know.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad,
I don't care which one.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Gandhi, Mother Teresa.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:90%
The homeless guy on the street.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are all masters.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
You will never
encounter someone that's

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:28.670 align:middle line:84%
not a magnificent,
glorious, divine being.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's this
whole great big universe.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Uni-verse.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I love that, because uni means
one, and verse means song.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:90%
There's this one big song.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And each and every
one of us have a part

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:90%
to play in that, a part to sing.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And I sing at a tone that's
far different than yours.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And every tone comes together
in the perfect melody,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:90%
the perfect harmony.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's already happening.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't see it, because we
see ourselves as separate.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But if we realized, and
stepped into the oneness

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:84%
that we already are,
and sang our songs so

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.460 align:middle line:84%
brightly and shined as we
do, it's like the stars.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a
different twinkle.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at that Milky
Way and that galaxy, you say,

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.750 align:middle line:84%
wow look how beautiful
it is collectively.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Look how beautiful the
stars are individually.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we are.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.167 align:middle line:90%
We're already that.

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to become.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, if it's so
good there, why be here?

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I deal with a lot of people
who struggle with suicide

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
or who have lost
children to suicide.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And I have no judgment of that.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There were many times
during my struggles

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that I thought I'd
rather just go.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I had a son here that
was keeping me pretty grounded.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think this
is the big game.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we can't
experience what

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
we want to experience
when everything's

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:90%
light and beauty and peace.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.563 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we wanted
to have the opposite.

00:39:06.563 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to experience what
we're not so we could finally

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:90%
embrace what we truly are.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.638 align:middle line:84%
I used to-- I mean, I'll go
back to my old football days,

00:39:13.638 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:84%
where they would draw
it on the chalkboard.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And all the X's and O's and
everything looked perfect.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you never knew
until you got on the field,

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and smelled the grass, and
had someone hit into you

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:90%
what it was like.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And I believe life is like that.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to come and
have the experience

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.930 align:middle line:90%
because our soul would expand.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And while we're here, we
just think, oh my gosh,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:90%
This is too hard.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.675 align:middle line:84%
But our higher self, our
higher knowledge thinks,

00:39:42.675 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah, but that's why you came.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's easy for me
to sit in a beautiful house

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.790 align:middle line:90%
and say life is good.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.293 align:middle line:84%
And there's people that
suffer, struggling.

00:39:52.293 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm working
with some folks that

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:90%
work with human trafficking.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, kids being taken
and put into the sex trade

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:90%
or whatever else.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
There are things in the world
that are heart wrenching.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And so how do we
look at those and say

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:90%
it's all in divine order?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.050 align:middle line:90%
How does this make sense?

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I embrace it as a perfect
opportunity to be love.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:84%
How can I shine
light in dark places?

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
How can I embrace things
and make a difference?

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And I realize I'm just one.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm just one guy.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But gosh, can I make life
better for somebody today?

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Can I do something for someone?

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And by doing it for the one,
you're doing it for the all.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Even when I raise my own
vibration, if I can go

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.860 align:middle line:84%
meditate for a minute and get
it peace, or forgive, something,

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:90%
even if it's forgiving myself.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I forgive others very easily.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:84%
The hard one to forgive
for me is myself.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:90%
That ripples out.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It ripples out and
affects the consciousness

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:90%
of all of humanity.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%
But it comes down to choice.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:90%
We live in fear.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We're so conditioned with
judgment, or religion,

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:84%
or even our parents or whoever
said, well, you're a bad boy.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve that.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not coming.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've got to earn that.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these
things that we have

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.900 align:middle line:84%
conditioned in our mind, when
in reality, we are deserving.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
We are worthy always.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:90%
We're of great worth.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth is so beautiful.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now, after having
the experiences I had,

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I used to wonder about miracles.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, gosh, how do
you create a miracle?

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet now, like, I can
go out and watch a sunrise,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's an absolute miracle.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Like, heaven's right here.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I see the flowers grow.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:35.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a miracle.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, smell the fresh air.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Feel the rain on your skin.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And think, wow, it's so
incredible to be in this realm

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:90%
and to be alive.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And there is no death.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm having this experience.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.093 align:middle line:90%
And there is no judgment.

00:41:47.093 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move from this.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, when
we pass from this life,

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
embraced by loving arms

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.147 align:middle line:84%
and simply asked,
what did you learn?

00:41:55.147 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what you
learned in your experience.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
What was it like
to be like that?

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:90%
What was it like to be you?

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:84%
What was it like to have
this or not have that?

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's all going to be a
collective oneness of, wow,

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.980 align:middle line:90%
look what we learned.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Look what we created.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Look at the uniqueness.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And we'll realize
we always were one.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.580 align:middle line:90%
We always were connected.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:84%
It was just our inability
to embrace it and realize it

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.110 align:middle line:90%
that held us back.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult, because
so much of our society

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:90%
just struggles day to day.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It's hand to mouth.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:90%
How do I survive?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, how do I make
enough money to pay the rent

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and to put groceries
on the table?

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no time or energy
for how do I assist others?

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
How do I make a
difference in the world?

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:90%
I found a key for me.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's if I can take
only 10 minutes a day--

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd rather take an
hour, but even 10 minutes

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to be still, to be still
and just reconnect.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Like, always be connected.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Just remember.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Remember that connection.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Remember who I am.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember that everything's
in divine order.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And let go of the fear.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the contention.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.188 align:middle line:84%
Let go of that doubt
that there's not enough.

00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, we live in such
fear that there's not enough.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough money.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.420 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough food.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.080 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough time.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough love.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if we can let
go of that and realize

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
there is enough
and I think the key

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.680 align:middle line:84%
for me was realizing
that I'm enough.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm enough.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I limp around on one
leg, and I do the best I can.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But I am enough by
simply being me.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.870 align:middle line:84%
By simply showing
up in light and love

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.120 align:middle line:90%
and loving the people around me.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And taking care of
those around me.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I say taking care of,
just energetically, you know?

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I will probably never
make enough money,

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.430 align:middle line:90%
you know, probably never have.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.050 align:middle line:90%
But then again, what's money?

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I've had lots of money,
and I've had nothing.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make me any
happier one way or the other.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, there's always
that, well, I want more money.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.572 align:middle line:90%
Or I need to make more of this.

00:43:56.572 --> 00:44:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if I only had more
money, I could get that.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They're just things.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're just things.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember sleeping in
the backseat of my car

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.090 align:middle line:90%
at one point when I was young.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And I had nothing.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.710 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't need anything.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was--

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Money is not who I am.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And none of it is who I am.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
If I really get in touch
with, I'm not the car.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the house.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the job.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not my partner.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the shoes or the
clothes or anything else.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I am all of it.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I am the divine.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I am me.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And me is enough
just the way I am.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I can be my contribution
in this universe without even

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.180 align:middle line:90%
trying, by just simply being.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Just being me.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I've had to let go of
control and expectations

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and comparisons.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I have some dear friends that
are Native, Indigenous people.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.425 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful
story that I was told once,

00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:90%
because I asked about that.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:90%
How do I control?

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:90%
How do I fix?

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.940 align:middle line:90%
How do I make?

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And this wise elder
said, no, no, no.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And then he told a story.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
He said when you
get in the river,

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
when you fight the current,
the harder you try to swim,

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:90%
you sink.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, when you
relax, when you let go,

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:84%
when you go with the
flow, the current

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:84%
will take you exactly
where you're meant to be.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.988 align:middle line:90%
I've been in the water.

00:45:25.988 --> 00:45:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Swimming is one of the only
things I can do anymore where

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:90%
I move my body, but it's true.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The harder you fight the
water, the faster you sink.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you just let go and
relax and float, it's peaceful.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is order
in the universe.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We'll be exactly where
we're meant to be.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.230 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:46.362 align:middle line:90%
And we're divine beings.

00:45:46.362 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're here to make
the world a better place

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and literally create peace
and joy for everyone.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt we could do it.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful, powerful people.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Any community is very powerful
when they step up and decide

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and choose a difference.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, never
underestimate the power

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:10%
of a small group of people
who are focused on change.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of
examples and thousands

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of barriers that have
been overcome where people

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.160 align:middle line:90%
find peace, they come together.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think humanity's
awakening and actually doing it

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.600 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:90%
