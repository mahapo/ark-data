into the cases of
dental fluorosis

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%

>> The problem for industry
is, if your pollutant has

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%

for this other damage.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The dental fluorosis would
not be a huge loss settlement,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%

bones, if their arthritis,

He was the research

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and he strongly suggested to Cox
that he should include fluoride

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:90%
in his study.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So here is a tea
bag, which I've opened,

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.890 align:middle line:90%
which is from economy tea.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to weigh two grams
and add 100 milliliters of water

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll first stir it,
and you can already

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:84%
see that you're getting
a cup of tea from this.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
This time, the
fluoride from the tea

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:90%
is coming out into the water.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
In two minutes, you
can get a majority.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Most of the fluoride
will come out

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
into the infusion
in two minutes time.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Very, very, very, very little.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Two minutes is all we need
to exceed the toxic limits

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:45.625 align:middle line:90%
of fluoride.

00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> For this sample, it is
showing me that it has got

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:90%
seven milligrams per liter.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Which is very high,
because you can

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
get more than they required
fluoride of your daily intake

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%
just by drinking
three mugs of tea.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can get up to 150%
of your daily requirement

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
just through that economy tea,
in terms of the three mugs.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If, like me, you are
wondering why the economy tea

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
contains more fluoride
than the others,

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:84%
we have to follow Aradhana
Mehra into the university

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:90%
greenhouses.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where she keeps
the tea plants that

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.000 align:middle line:84%
are able to absorb
fluoride from the ground.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The tea that is collected
for consumption or for use

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
for the tea is the top part,
the bud and the top two leaves.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is the tea which
makes good quality tea.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.040 align:middle line:84%
The tea is collected
and picked by hand.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if you are
going to use the lower tea

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:84%
leaves, they are going
to be more mature,

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and they will have
more fluoride in it.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So to make economy
teas, you might even

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
have mechanical harvesting,
and therefore tea

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
is just collected like that from
the top, which will obviously

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.470 align:middle line:84%
not include the top
bud and the two leaves

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
but other mature leaves as well.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of that, when it
is processed and ground,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that becomes your
economy tea that we

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:90%
buy from the supermarket.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And therefore it's got a
high load of fluoride in it.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In English and
American tea drinkers,

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
a handful of studies have shown
cases of skeletal fluorosis,

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:84%
a disease where fluoride
takes the place of calcium.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The bones become fragile
and break with no reason.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.073 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that they don't
think it's bad for health.

00:30:49.073 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of those
things which is very

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
neutral, that people drink it.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
They think it's
just safe product.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think like so many
other things in our lives,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
if you drink too much
tea, drink tea to excess,

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:90%
it would be dangerous.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Drink less tea, ban
certain types of water,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
some types of salt?

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
After all, it doesn't seem
that difficult to get rid

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:90%
of fluoride, right?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be beaten that easily.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
All over the planet, there
is a chemical product

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.650 align:middle line:84%
that is omnipresent and
which nobody can escape from,

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
a compound that causes
illnesses much more

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:90%
severe than fluorosis.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PFC compounds are chemicals
that are used to make outdoor

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:90%
gear waterproof.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Many manufacturers of
weatherproof jackets, trousers,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and shoes use PFCs to make their
products more water repellent.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is our old friend
hiding under a new name, PFCs,

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
or perfluocarbons.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Greenpeace sounded the alarm.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Associated with carbon
and chemically modified,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
fluoride becomes
extremely dangerous.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Scientists from Greenpeace went
to every corner of the globe

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to take samples and found PFCs
even in the furthest reaches.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
A chemical compound
created in factories

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:90%
spread around the world.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> During production, those
tiny particles not only end up

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:84%
in nearby bodies of water, but
are dispersed across the globe

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.800 align:middle line:84%
as gases or fine
particulate matter.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They travel with the wind and
eventually drift back to earth.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> These days, PFCs are
rattling the scientific world.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, they were
identified as being

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
priority dangerous
substances by Europe.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> This compounds,
they are accumulated.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
That means they
stay in your body.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They go into the organs,
like kidneys or liver

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and stay there
for several years,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
2.5 years up to nine years,
they stay in your body.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This ex-chemist has
made PFC his pet hate.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Since he joined
Greenpeace in Germany,

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Manfred Santen has
worked tirelessly

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
to track down what are known
as perfluorinate compounds.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Because PFCs are hidden in many
of our daily household items,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Mandred Santen has undertaken
an in-depth investigation.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A few weeks ago, he bought a
large variety of products from

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:84%
around the world in order to
test them in his laboratory.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> We have a collection here.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
We have, for
example, a backpack.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
This could be
impregnated with PFC.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And a sleeping bag that
could contain PFC. We

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:90%
have a shoe over here.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And we also have, for
example, pizza boxes that

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.690 align:middle line:84%
could contain PFC
inside, to make it easier

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to get the pizza out, so that
it does not attach to the paper,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
to the box.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That is the only
reason, of course.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We have some muffin paper
baking molds that contain--

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
can contain PFC, to
make them for oil

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and fat resistant or repellent.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.709 align:middle line:84%
And we have some microwave
popcorn packaging

00:34:39.709 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:90%
that could contain PFC.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do they use it in the
sleeping bag, for example?

00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.312 align:middle line:90%
Makes no sense.

00:34:49.312 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Water repellent in
the sleeping bag

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:84%
is not needed,
because you will not

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:84%
sleep in the rain with
the bag, always inside.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't need PFC
in sleeping Bags

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know if it
is a health risk or not.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't know exactly, because
if you sleep in that bag

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.365 align:middle line:84%
and are sweating or
something like that,

00:35:08.365 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:84%
or it's very hot in
summertime, for example,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and the PFC are in the
tent, they can evaporate

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and then you breathe them.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.640 align:middle line:90%
So this is not necessary.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Does the compound evaporate?

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it absorbed into food?

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are investigating
these unanswered questions,

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but one thing has
already been proved.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The manufacturing and the
use of perfluorated compounds

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in factories around the world
have serious consequences

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:90%
for our health.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
We had never imagined
how many kilometers

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
we would travel in order to
conduct our investigation.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I found myself
in deepest West Virginia,

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:84%
following the tracks of
perfluorated compounds

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:84%
in Paul Brooks's
brand new pickup.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
The doctor wished to show
me around Parkersburg

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and talk to me
about a subject that

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
haunts the inhabitants of this
small town in Eastern America.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Here everyone knows about PFCs.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:84%
perfluorated compounds
or the main products

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:90%
of a plant in the region.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That the plant?

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the plant right there.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:84%
For years, they pumped
that stuff into the river.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.150 align:middle line:84%
They called it
poop, human feces.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:84%
They said we pooped
into the river.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:84%
That was in their documents, in
their own corporate documents.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is the plant that
had secretly defecated

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.200 align:middle line:90%
into the river.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the biggest
production site

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
in the world, owned
by DuPont de Nemours,

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:84%
a legend of the
chemical industry, who

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.535 align:middle line:90%
invented Teflon thanks to PFCs.

00:37:05.535 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Even burned food
won't stick to Teflon,

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:90%
so it's always easy to clean.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:90%
If it has DuPont Teflon.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me tell you a story.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.465 align:middle line:84%
Because behind the commercial
attractions of a non-stick pan

00:37:25.465 --> 00:37:26.265 align:middle line:90%
hides a tragedy.

00:37:26.265 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.950 align:middle line:84%
To produce Teflon,
for over 50 years

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
DuPont used a particular
perfluorated compound, PFOA

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:84%
or C8, creating toxic
smoke contaminating

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.700 align:middle line:84%
all the local water
sources and the drinking

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.310 align:middle line:90%
water of the entire region.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the
science, it takes a very,

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:84%
very small amount of C8
to cause a problem, OK?

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And remember, C8 has a
halflife of about four years

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, it's
Parkersberg's history that

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.980 align:middle line:84%
allows us to understand the
impact of PFCs on our health.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:84%
A living laboratory
for all the inhabitants

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, who,
without being aware of it,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.070 align:middle line:84%
drink and breathe
perfluorated compounds.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
In the region, the drinking
water was heavily contaminated.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
More and more
inhabitants became ill.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.590 align:middle line:84%
In 2005, 70,000 people
had their blood analyzed.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The study showed that PFOA
was present in their blood,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:90%
often at a high dose.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:54.506 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.506 --> 00:39:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So I take probably, let's
see, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.825 align:middle line:90%
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:11.625 align:middle line:90%
16.

00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>> 16 years ago, Earl
Bodkins' life changed forever.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:84%
One by one, the different
diagnoses piled up.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid problems, high
cholesterol, and worst of all,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.650 align:middle line:90%
ulcerous colitis.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.740 align:middle line:84%
This disease, similar
to Crohn's disease,

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:90%
has made his life hell.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The medics suggest
removing his colon,

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
but Earl cannot
make up his mind.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So he eats almost
nothing during the day,

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
so that he isn't
bothered whilst at work.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually I just
have some toast,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'll drink a little bit
of coffee and maybe something

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:90%
cold.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.476 align:middle line:84%
I don't drink much orange juice
because of the acid in it,

00:40:00.476 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but I usually have about three
or four trips to the bathroom

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:90%
before I leave in the morning.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Every day is torture.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.546 align:middle line:84%
Eating anything
leaves him indisposed.

00:40:11.546 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have a snack
sometimes during the day,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:84%
some crackers or
something to that effect.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But the only real meal I
have is in the evening.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> For a long time, Earl
just thought it was bad luck.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.025 align:middle line:84%
The illnesses had probably
just happened by chance.

00:40:31.025 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It took his wife Gwen some
time to make the link.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:84%
The DuPont trial started
to make the headlines,

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.540 align:middle line:84%
but the plant was 70
kilometers away from them.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:90%
It was so far away.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be that.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Until 2005, when the
couple received a letter.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> They came out with saying
I don't know exactly how many

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:84%
years ago where you go down for
this screening and they'd pay

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
you $400 a person or something
to go get the bloodwork.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody, I think,
in the community went out,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.180 align:middle line:90%
participated in it.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.083 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people did, because
they were gonna pay them,

00:41:18.083 --> 00:41:18.883 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:41:18.883 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea what
would come out of it,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, so we went
through the first testing

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:26.785 align:middle line:90%
and the second testing.

00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Gwen and Earl had in fact
joined a study of 70,000

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:90%
inhabitants in the region.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:84%
The largest scientific study
on the effect of PFOA on humans

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:84%
was conducted by
three epidemiologists

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
from reputable English
and American universities.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:55.000 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.690 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, David Savitz
and his colleagues

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.400 align:middle line:90%
published their results.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.390 align:middle line:90%
They were unequivocal.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Our assignment was to judge
whether there was a probable

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
link between exposure
to PFOA and disease.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
There were five diseases where
we did judge the evidence

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
as indicating a link between
exposure and a health problem.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And those included heart
disease, the various forms.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We weren't able to
be more specific,

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:84%
but various forms
of heart disease.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Kidney cancer, testicular
cancer, thyroid disease,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:84%
ulcerative colitis, a
disease of the intestines,

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and pre-eclampsia, which is
hypertension during pregnancy.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.182 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.182 --> 00:42:55.592 align:middle line:90%
>> [SINGING]

00:42:55.592 --> 00:42:59.612 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.612 --> 00:43:00.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:01.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Earl.

00:43:01.002 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, babe.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing good.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.418 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you into there?

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I've been
looking at pictures.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've got so many that
need to be put in albums.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Earl and Gwen joined a
collective lawsuit against

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:84%
DuPont de Nemours, as if in
retribution for the theft

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful life they'd
had before Earl got ill.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Gwen says that she
lives in the moment

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and refuses to think
about the future.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, however, sees
the future as a tragicomedy.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll continue taking
drugs one of these days.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:90%
My heart will go away.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Gwen will live to be 120.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm gonna live to be 125.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Where'd you get 120?

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And she'll have two or three
other guys drinking beer out

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:90%
of my refrigerator.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.910 align:middle line:90%
You can eliminate all that.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.092 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't dwell on
it all the time,

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
because it would
keep you messed up.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It would keep you angry.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:90%
You'd be mad, you know?

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.544 align:middle line:90%
>> It'll keep you depressed.

00:44:05.544 --> 00:44:06.344 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.250 align:middle line:84%
DuPont knew what
they were doing.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:90%
It's criminal charges, because--

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I get mad and I get
upset with them.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, DuPont knew
about the dangers of PFC,

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and had known for a while.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and completely every productive
enterprise the Japanese have

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:90%
in any city.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1945, the USA had just
dropped the first atomic bomb

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:90%
on Hiroshima.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:84%
A few years before,
the Manhattan Project

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:84%
had been launched,
a secret defense

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.900 align:middle line:84%
mission to construct factories
throughout the country

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:90%
to produce the bomb.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Engineers found a way to enrich
uranium thanks to fluoride,

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.490 align:middle line:84%
an extremely
corrosive substance,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:84%
which needed the precious
input of industrialists, DuPont

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.890 align:middle line:90%
and their PFC-based Teflon.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Fluoride was essential
in manufacturing the uranium

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%
atomic bomb.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Giant, huge
quantities of fluoride

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:84%
were mixed with uranium in a
gas called uranium hexafluoride.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And that gas was
used to separate

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the explosive
fraction of uranium

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.220 align:middle line:90%
from the non-explosive fraction.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:84%
They required trucks
and tankers which

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.670 align:middle line:84%
could resist the corrosive
power of the fluoride gases.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that they found
that would protect steel

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:84%
from corrosive fluoride
influence was Teflon.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Teflon was something
that DuPont had

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.980 align:middle line:90%
an expertise in manufacturing.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So DuPont's
expertise in fluoride

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:84%
was really the secret weapon
that allowed the United States

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to build the atomic bomb.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DuPont had in fact
invented Teflon in its Jackson

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:90%
laboratory a few years earlier.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Their employees worked secretly
for the Manhattan Project,

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
but serious medical
problems started

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
appearing wherever the
perfluorated compounds were

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.460 align:middle line:90%
handled.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In this recently declassified
document from November 1944,

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.370 align:middle line:84%
sent to Col. Warren, the leader
of the Manhattan Project,

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the army worries that the
affair would be divulged.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:02.300 align:middle line:84%
"Some of these men were
definitely undesirable workers

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:90%
on this particular project.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.450 align:middle line:84%
They have spread the word
that transfer to these areas

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is more or less an exile
to Devil's Island."

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Labor organizers and workers
were agitating because of how

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:84%
many injuries there had been
and how scared the workers were

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:84%
of handling these manifestly
dangerous chemicals.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.750 align:middle line:90%
There were deaths.

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:90%
There were terrible burns.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.480 align:middle line:84%
There were exposures
on a very large scale.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.620 align:middle line:84%
DuPont were well
aware of how poisonous

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.700 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals were that they
were using during World War II.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:42.470 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Since then, a lot of water
has passed under the bridge,

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and Teflon has become a
beloved household name.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, studies
showed that cooking pans let out

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:84%
toxic fumes at
high temperatures.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, PFCs are everywhere, in our
pans, our duvets, our carpets,

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:06.140 align:middle line:90%
in the air, in our water.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.440 align:middle line:84%
According to a study by the
American health authorities,

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:84%
98% of Americans
have perfluorated

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:90%
compounds in their blood.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need to
live next to a factory

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:90%
to be contaminated.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The proof can be found
in a country that

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
should be free of all pollution,
in a corner of paradise.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It is probably one of the most
sumptuous places on the planet,

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
these lost islands
between the Norwegian sea

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and the North Atlantic
Ocean, the Faroe Islands.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Life here would be peaceful
if scientists had not

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:84%
found PFC in the blood
of most of the residents

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of the archipelago,
including the children.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FAROESE]

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Over five years, this
scientist studied the blood

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:90%
of 650 children on the island.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.370 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Pal Weihe discovered a
manner of contamination

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:90%
that he had never suspected.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:90%


00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Our surprise was that
breastfeeding was so important

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:38.950 align:middle line:84%
for the actual concentration
of PFC in the child,

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that breastfeeding was a
main contributor to the PFC

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:84%
concentration in
the small children.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The deeper Pal Weihe
went into his study,

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.770 align:middle line:84%
the more the results
became worrying.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.640 align:middle line:84%
He showed that the longer
women breastfed their child,

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the higher the concentration
of perfluorated compounds

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:90%
increased in the baby's blood.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's one with just
a short breastfeeding.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And there the
concentration is only 5.3.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the person with the
longest duration of 12 months.

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:84%
12 months of exclusive
breastfeeding, that person,

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:35.950 align:middle line:90%
the first person here.

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go in and find what
the concentration of PFC

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.530 align:middle line:90%
was in the blood of the child.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:48.210 align:middle line:90%
That was 10.1.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:90%
That is in the high level.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> These results are concerning,
as the immune system is very

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable in the first
few months of life.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Four years ago,
Pal Weihe conducted

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:05.120 align:middle line:84%
a study looking at
children and PFCs,

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and indeed showed
a stronger effect

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:12.000 align:middle line:84%
on the organism's
defense mechanisms.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So for every doubling
of PFC at the age of five,

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.140 align:middle line:84%
there was a reduction of about
50% of the antibody formation

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.390 align:middle line:90%
at age seven.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, really,
what that means,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.150 align:middle line:84%
but it could be from
infectious diseases.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.660 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:84%
In the worst case
scenario, to take

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.560 align:middle line:90%
cancer and autoimmune diseases.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This study was alarming
to the mothers on the island,

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.080 align:middle line:84%
because here breastfeeding
is a religion.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.980 align:middle line:84%
97% of mothers
breastfeed their child.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Jonrit Halling breastfed
her two sons for a year.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FAROESE]

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But for her third
child, who is on its way,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.696 align:middle line:84%
she is almost sure that
she won't do the same.

00:52:09.696 --> 00:52:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FAROESE]

00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I could not have done it
in another way back then,

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.850 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't knew better.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But now I think
for my next child,

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I will think about
how long I am going

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.040 align:middle line:90%
to breastfeed, the duration.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:90%
At least four months, I think.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe half year, but not longer.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> A few years ago, Jonrit
Halling was able to have

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:41.810 align:middle line:84%
a blood test in order to
know her levels of PFC,

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because she is a scientist
and was working on a study

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.070 align:middle line:90%
on the subject.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We could all have this
test, but it is expensive,

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
because it is only conducted
in specialized laboratories.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Jonrit Halling was not
surprised to discover

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that she was contaminated,
probably alongside all mothers

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.040 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Since then, PFCs have
put into question

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:90%
the benefits of breastfeeding.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a shame, because
of course breastfeeding is

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the most natural thing,
and it is still, I think,

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.310 align:middle line:90%
the best for your baby.

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And as an individual,
it's very hard

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to do anything to
avoid this exposure.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you buy clothes
and shoes for children,

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:90%
it's very difficult to avoid.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Difficult, but
not impossible.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:42.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago, Adidas was
strongly rebuked by Greenpeace.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Through an international
campaign named Detox,

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:84%
the ecologists attempted to
force both Adidas and Nike

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.725 align:middle line:84%
from using dangerous
chemicals, including PFCs.

00:53:57.725 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.510 align:middle line:84%
At the headquarters
of Adidas in Germany,

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you won't find anybody
who will tell you

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that it was this campaign
that led to the brand changing

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.950 align:middle line:90%
its products.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But after all, does
it really matter?

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.780 align:middle line:84%
The group was the first
to attack the use of PFCs.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.820 align:middle line:90%
That earned them a quick visit.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Steve Richardson has set
himself the challenge

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of having a 99% PFC-free range
by the 31st of December 2017.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:90%
He's already working on it.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The vast majority
of Adidas product,

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.890 align:middle line:90%
over 90% do not contain PFCs.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It's products like these
outdoor garments, which

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.740 align:middle line:84%
can be used as a
performance t-shirt,

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.740 align:middle line:84%
things like our football
jerseys or uniforms

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:05.420 align:middle line:84%
for sports like wrestling or
tennis don't contain PFCs.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But a part of the range,
like weather-proof jackets,

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.350 align:middle line:84%
ski garments, or swimming
costumes are still posing

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:19.190 align:middle line:84%
a problem for Him with these
products that are sometimes

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:23.800 align:middle line:84%
in permanent contact with water,
leaving out PFCs makes them

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.180 align:middle line:90%
much less effective.

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We built these jackets with
half PFC-free material and half

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.920 align:middle line:84%
PFC material, so we could
compare the functionality

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.307 align:middle line:90%
in the same conditions.

00:55:36.307 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've asked our-- we had
our athletes wear those out

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.060 align:middle line:84%
in the rain, and this can show
a little bit of what we saw.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:48.000 align:middle line:84%
When we spray water
onto the PFC-free side,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.480 align:middle line:84%
it starts to penetrate in and
actually wick into the fabric

very quickly.

Whereas on this side
still containing PFCs,

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.760 align:middle line:84%
the water beads on the surface
for a much longer time.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to find
a replacement that works.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we've engaged
with the chemical industry

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and even collaborated
with other apparel brands

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to try to find solutions that
can work for our consumers.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The majority of
industrialists have not yet

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:84%
bothered to conduct these
long and expensive research

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
During my filming, Greenpeace
received the results

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:31.170 align:middle line:84%
of their samples, and the search
for perfluorated compounds

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:34.110 align:middle line:90%
was unfortunately very fruitful.

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Out of 40 products, only
four didn't contain any.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> This has been analyzed.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a tent bought in
Russia, and we found PFOA

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:47.940 align:middle line:90%
in really high concentrations.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So 12 micrograms per
square meter fabric.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot, because we say
it should not be more than one.

00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:59.170 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> For a number of years now,
a few countries have called

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:05.710 align:middle line:90%
for a definitive ban on PFOA.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:09.010 align:middle line:84%
To get around this future
ban, industrialists

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:84%
have already replaced it with
other perfluorated compounds

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.060 align:middle line:84%
whilst assuring that these
ones are not dangerous.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:23.810 align:middle line:84%
There is still a long but
necessary battle ahead

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to rid the planet of this
authorized toxic companion.
