00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Our world today seems
to be in total upheaval.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Many people are wondering
if, in fact, we have not

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.590 align:middle line:90%
reached the biblical end times.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.995 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:90%
But how can we know?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Are we simply to be
spectators to these events?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Or have we been
given information--

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
messages that offer hope or
even help avoid these disasters?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, a particle physicist
working independently

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
made a discovery
that could change

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
everything we think we know
about the world we live in.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that something
as inconsequential

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
as this tiny fiber contains such
a message for the entire world?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Have new ways of obtaining
long hidden information

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%
been discovered?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The emissions from a
physical object or when studied

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:10%
as a whole uniquely identify
events in the history of that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:10%
object.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Have scientists finally
discovered where to look

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:90%
for the secrets of the universe?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:10%
>> And we have a piece of cloth.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And it leads us to a mysterious
gate, which opens for us.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:10%
And it lets us to see a
completely different world,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary world
with extraordinary laws.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What is this
mysterious gateway?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And what are these
extraordinary laws that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:90%
are only now being discovered?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that time, space,
and energy interact in a way

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
never before predicted?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Physicists are always trying
to find unifying principles.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there a unifying principle of
the very, very large relativity

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and the very, very small
quantum physics, which

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:84%
if we could see what
that principle was,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
we could explain everything?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Has that principle
been discovered?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Is modern science now
beginning to decode

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
messages that might even be
coming from another dimension?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:10%
Is there something on the
scientific horizon that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:10%
suggests we have finally been
given the secrets of life

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:10%
itself--

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.715 align:middle line:10%
perhaps even eternal life?

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
which produces the order

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Now the big problem
is we don't quite

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:90%
know what that something is.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So even though I talk like
we do, believe me, folks.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a big mystery still out
there waiting to be discovered.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of time, the
creation of the universe,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even a link
to another dimension--

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
can these great riddles of
the universe be solved through

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:90%
the lens of the ancient past?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
In the next hour, you will
stand at the threshold

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
of today's most stunning
scientific discoveries.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Images never before
seen will reach out

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
from the dust of antiquity and
touch your life today in ways

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:90%
you never thought possible.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, scholars,
scientists, and historians

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
all come together in an amazing
and unflinching investigation

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
into the fabric of time.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:10%
In a world where
children grow up

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:10%
playing with computers
and calculus is frequently

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:10%
part of the high
school curriculum,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:10%
many of the scientific
mysteries of the past

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:10%
are today commonplace knowledge.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Yet, even the world's
leading scientists

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
would agree that when it comes
to understanding the universe

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
we live in and the physical
laws that we think govern it,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
only a very few of the threads
that make up this vast tapestry

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:90%
have been untangled.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But these few threads
are endlessly intriguing.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's theory of relativity,
quantum mechanics, particle

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
physics all taunt
us with the notion

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we can
know the unknowable.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet, these studies
have only begun

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the intricate
interweaving of forces

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:90%
that make up the universe.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these lofty
scientific pursuits are being

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
advanced exponentially by
the information contained

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
in one ancient, Earthly,
hand-woven piece of cloth?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Some scientists say yes.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But in order to understand
how that could be,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
we must first understand the
secrets these scientists are

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
trying to uncover.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
>> The basic ideas behind
quantum physics and relativity

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:90%
are really quite simple.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The laws of physics are the same
for all observers regardless

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of where they are and
how fast they're going.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:10%
>> The universe that this model
leads us to is an intelligent,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:10%
self-organizing, creative,
learning, trial and error,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:10%
participatory, interactive,
non-locally interconnected

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:10%
evolutionary system.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> That may seem simple
enough to the scientists.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But how can an awareness
of these concepts

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
help us understand the
meaning of why we're here

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and where we're going?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:10%
Is there some
deeper understanding

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:10%
that can be gained through
all of this scientific study?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we care about quantum
physics and relativity so much?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically they're really
very beautiful theories.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But if that's all they were, we
wouldn't care very much at all.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
What we feel, though, is
that they're gateways.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
They're leading us into new ways
of understanding the universe.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And that we care
about very much.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I sincerely think that
through these studies,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:10%
we will come upon a completely
new structure of physics,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:10%
maybe even a completely
different world.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Science has discovered the
basic structure of the entire

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
universe by studying the
tiniest possible things.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:10%
And they did it with the largest
scientific instruments ever

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:10%
built. One such instrument is
16 miles long, fills a mountain,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and searches for particles
a trillion times smaller

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:10%
than a human hair.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Why search for the
tiniest of tiny particles?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been known for a long
time that all physical matter

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
emits and reabsorbs
particles of energy.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Over 100 years ago, Max Planck
named these emissions quanta

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:90%
or quantum singularly.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have been the
study of particle physics

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.785 align:middle line:90%
for over 100 years.

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you analyze
all the emissions

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
from any physical object, that's
called a quantum hologram.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
We now understand that all
physical objects have a quantum

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:90%
hologram.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> That study has produced a
set of laws that scientists call

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:90%
the standard model.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the theory
that summarizes

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:84%
the scientists'
current understanding

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
of elementary particles and the
fundamental forces of nature.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, what's going on in
the standard model of particle

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
physics is extremely mind
bending and paradoxical.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, the standard model
says that there are inside

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of the nucleus invisible
particles-- particles we never

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
see on their own called quarks.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And no one has ever
seen a single quark.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
In spite of the fact that
we've achieved a lot of success

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
in physics, there's
still a lot of mystery

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:90%
here yet to be discovered.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But assuming all
of this is true,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.215 align:middle line:84%
where can we begin to look for
a meaningful example of what all

00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
of this means to you and me?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it all just some cosmic
Rubik's cube for scientists

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:90%
to play with?

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible there
is a broader purpose--

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
ancient information
perhaps-- that

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:90%
is even more relevant today.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1970s, scientists
developed a computer program

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that allowed NASA technicians
to read the terrain

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
characteristics of
distant planets derived

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
from two-dimensional
satellite photographs.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But the developers of
this amazing device

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
were in for a shock
when they were

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
asked to analyze a photograph
of something most of them

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
had never even heard of.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually what they
were looking at

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
was a two-dimensional photograph
of a two-dimensional artifact.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But to everyone's
amazement, from somewhere

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
there emerged
three-dimensional information.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
To these practical
scientists, it

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
was as if they were looking at
something from another planet.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
None of them had ever seen
anything like this before.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
A photograph of an ancient cloth
had brought the scientists face

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to face with the impossible.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Three--dimensional information
was being discovered where it

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
couldn't possibly exist.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, a broad
range of scientists

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
took a professional
interest in what

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
had been for those who were
even aware of it nothing more

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:90%
than a mild curiosity.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But for one particle
physicist, this tiny fiber

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
generated the most excitement.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It is a single thread
from that same cloth.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And resting on its
surface is the hint

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of an image that
is barely visible.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that somewhere
in the origins of this image

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:90%
lay the secrets of the universe?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:84%
The artifact was
the Shroud of Turin.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And without a doubt, it is
the most picked at, X-rayed,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
examined, revered, reviled,
tested, studied, scanned,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.845 align:middle line:84%
and photographed artifact
in the world today.

00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:10%
For those who are unfamiliar
with this particular piece

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:10%
of cloth, it has
long been revered

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:10%
as the object
described in the Gospel

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:10%
according to John Chapter
20 verses 6 and 7.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Referring to Peter,
John wrote, "He

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:10%
saw the strips of
linen lying there,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:10%
as well as the burial cloth that
had been around Jesus' head.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:10%
The cloth was
folded up by itself,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:10%
separate from the linen."

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
For over 100 years,
researchers, historians,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and scientists of
every variety have

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
attempted to determine if
this linen cloth tucked away

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
in a cathedral in Turin,
Italy could actually

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:90%
be the one referred to--

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the burial shroud
of Jesus Christ.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
An attempt was made
to discover the answer

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to that question in 1978 when
a group of American scientists

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
were given unprecedented
access to the shroud for 5

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:90%
intensive days.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Over the next several
years, this tireless group

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
known as the Shroud of
Turin Research Project,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:84%
or STRP for short,
which was comprised

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
of many of the world's
premier scientists

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:84%
representing such diverse
disciplines as physics,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, engineering, forensic
medicine, and many others

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
spent no less than
150,000 man hours

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:84%
studying, testing, and
interpreting the data.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The results seemed to
indicate the shroud could

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
be a genuine first century
burial cloth from somewhere

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:90%
in Palestine.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But then in 1988,
carbon dating analysis

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
by three different
testing laboratories

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
produced quite a
different result.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The radiocarbon dates
that we obtained clearly put

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the shroud, uh, in
the Middle Ages.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> According to the
carbon-14 tests,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:10%
the shroud came into existence
somewhere between the years

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:10%
1260 and 1390.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Could all the other
scientists be wrong?

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:10%
First of all, we must
point out that the dating

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:10%
of a shroud sample in 1988
was both controversial

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:10%
and hotly disputed by
experts in many fields.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The problem of
dating a cloth--

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:10%
not only the shroud, but I
think any cloth, any old cloth--

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:10%
is not easy to solve
completely and definitely.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the professor,
the idea of a medieval origin

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud leads to
an impossible thesis--

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
the forger would have had
to find a man to crucify,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
flog him mercilessly,
place him in a shroud,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and then manufacture or
simply wait for the image

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to somehow appear.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that is quite
impossible that what we cannot

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:10%
do today--

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:10%
it was very easy and
during a medieval period.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:10%
>> 150,000 man hours and the
work of dozens of scientific

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:10%
disciplines were challenged--
actually brushed aside--

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:10%
by a single carbon-14 test.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But the world was left
with the same question.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:90%
What created the image?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And how do all of these
latest scientific advances

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
lead us to this
particular artifact?

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
What is there about
the image that

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
causes scientists to
put their reputations

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and fortunes at risk?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The Resurrection itself
belongs to the spiritual world.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think it is the
business of physics to--

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:10%
to talk about it.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:10%
However, the shroud
itself and what

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:10%
made the image leads us to
a mysterious gate, which

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:10%
opens for us.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:10%
And it lets us to see a
completely different world,

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary world
with extraordinary laws.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> What are those laws?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And do they exist regardless
of the age of the fabric?

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Is this purely a
scientific squabble?

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:10%
Or could it be there
is something here

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:10%
that is far more important
than the artifact itself?

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that the energy
and information now being

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:10%
detected is actually
the information

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:10%
we need to help us overcome
the problems we face today?

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Are the secrets
of the universe--

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
perhaps of all
creation-- locked up

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in this seemingly ordinary
linen burial cloth?

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Can the image-- now known
to contain three-dimensional

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
information-- also be
a quantum hologram?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we should take
a moment and define

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the
Shroud of Turin is

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and what makes it so special
in the minds of so many people.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The shroud is an ordinary
piece of hand-woven fabric that

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
measures 14 feet 3 inches
long and 3 feet 7 inches wide.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
These full-length dark lines
are scorches from the fire that

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:90%
nearly destroyed it in 1532.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The diamond-shaped patches cover
holes resulting from that fire.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:10%
But it is the
faint, ghostly image

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:10%
of a crucified man on the
surface of the cloth that

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:10%
rivets our attention and
makes this piece of cloth

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:10%
unique in all the world.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:84%
What is the truth
about the Shroud?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it a communication
from another time,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:90%
another dimension?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And if so, can we determine what
the message is intended to be?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that the quantum
revolution in physics

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
permits science to go
beyond human speculation?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:84%
According to some
physicists, the world

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
is even more extraordinary
than we thought.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, this
ordinary piece

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of linen cloth that
many scientists believe

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to be over 2,000 years
old might give scientists

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
their most tangible clue
to unlocking the secrets

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum hologram.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet, some still maintain
the carbon-14 test

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
places its scientific value
under a cloud of suspicion.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>> There are hundreds
of pieces of evidence,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:10%
both scientific and historical,
that indicate that the Shroud

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:10%
is authentic.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:10%
There is only one
piece of evidence

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:10%
that says the shroud
is not authentic.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's carbon-14.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:10%
However, carbon-14 has
itself been much disputed.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:10%
It is neither logical,
empirical, or scientific

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:10%
to take one piece of
evidence and ignore

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:10%
the hundreds of
pieces of evidence

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:10%
in support of authenticity.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We are faced
with a paradox here.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:84%
All of the scientific
analysis seems

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to place the cloth in
Jerusalem in the first century.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But the carbon-14 test makes
the shroud unequivocally a 13th

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%
century relic.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
What if both
analyses are correct?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But how could the
carbon-14 tests

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
be as accurate as
modern technology can

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
make them and all of the
other scientific data that

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
places the cloth solidly in the
first century also be accurate?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
That possibility was suggested
at the Sindone 2000 Worldwide

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Congress in Orvieto, Italy.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Authors M Sue Benford and
Joseph Marino posited the notion

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that a 16th century
invisible patch

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
had skewed the 1988 carbon-14
test on the sample taken

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
from the Shroud of Turin.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Their idea was backed
by what seemed to be

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:90%
solid historical research.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion
was immediately

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
rejected as being
technically impossible.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
At this point another scientist,
one of the original STRP team,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:90%
became interested.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:10%
Like others who had closely
examined the shroud,

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:10%
he, too, was very skeptical of
the whole idea of reweaving.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
The late Raymond
Rogers set himself

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
the task of discovering
whether or not

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
scientific analysis could
resolve the issue once

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%
and for all.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Rogers obtained
samples of the Shroud

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:84%
immediately adjacent to the
area used in the carbon-14 test.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:10%
These were provided by
Gilbert Raes, the man who

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:10%
had originally removed them.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:10%
In an interview unveiled
at the 2005 Dallas

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:10%
Symposium on the Shroud,
Rogers told the interviewer--

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:10%
>> This is just
about the last straw.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I've got the samples that
can shoot that full of holes.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:90%
So I got out the Raes samples.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I got out some of
the shroud samples.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And I went to work again.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold in
less than an hour,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the Raes
sample was totally

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
different in
chemical composition

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
than the main part
of the shroud.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the shocker
that really shook me up--

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
in looking at the
Raes threads, I

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:84%
hit this one that was
an end to end splice.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
the sort of thing

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that Benford and
Marino were talking

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
about in this
invisible reweaving.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> After coming to
this conclusion,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
ray called me one day
and said flat out, Tom,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
there is no scientific
wiggle room.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to this point, then,
we can say with some degree

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of scientific certainty that
the Shroud is an authentic first

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:90%
century fabric.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists may
continue to disagree.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But for the moment at least,
the 1988 carbon-14 tests

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
on the Shroud appear to
have been invalidated.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, a group of
digital scientists in Amsterdam

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
focused their expertise
on a different set of data

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from the shroud.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
What they found
stunned them all.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Holographic information
is encoded in the shroud

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:90%
in an interference pattern.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And most probably there's
more information in it,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
which I call like a blueprint
of the universe, maybe

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:90%
an opening to a new science.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:90%
You come in an unknown land.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a GPS.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a map.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:90%
It's completely new.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.678 align:middle line:90%
You have to reinvent science.

00:19:14.678 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
one of the things

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:90%
that the Shroud is all about.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:10%
>> But even if we are to accept
the shroud as a genuine first

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:10%
century fabric, that's only
one piece of the puzzle.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Validating the age of
the fabric is important.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
But the work being
done in Holland

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:84%
promises even more
exciting revelations.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
If the fabric has been proven
to be a genuine first century

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
material, could it be there
is supporting evidence

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to suggest this very
fabric might, in fact, be

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the actual burial
shroud of Jesus Christ?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Have these scientists discovered
something in the image

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
itself that places this piece of
cloth in a tomb near Golgotha,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
which brings us to the next and
so far unanswered question--

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
how did the image get there?

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:10%
There can be no doubt
that the Shroud of Turin

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:10%
has been venerated
for hundreds of years

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:10%
by the faithful as the
cloth or sheet that

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:10%
covered the body of
the crucified Christ.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Nor can there be any doubt
that the Shroud exists.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It has been touched, handled,
photographed, and examined

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:90%
in every way imaginable.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But has the result of all the
research, testing, and study

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
brought us any closer to proving
not only the age of the fabric,

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
but the reason for
its veneration?

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There are those who insist
the authenticity of the shroud

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:90%
has not been proven.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
What's more, they
contend the idea

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that it once wrapped
the crucified body

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
of the historic Jesus can
indeed never be proven.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Recently others have
challenged that assumption.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And the search for historic
and scientific evidence

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that might corroborate the
authenticity of the shroud

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:90%
goes on.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And even Cardinal Severino
Poletto, the papal custodian

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Holy Shroud at
the cathedral in Turin

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:90%
finds the search fascinating.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:10%
>> My attitude toward science
is one of great respect.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And scientists, many scientists
in the world, study the shroud

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and carry out research.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:10%
And they see what can
be discovered step

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:10%
by step as studies proceed.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>> And if science in the
future offers us well-founded

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and incontrovertible elements,
we will always be delighted.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Pope John Paul II said that it
was not the task of the church,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:10%
but of the historians
and scientists to define

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:10%
whether it is authentic or not.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:10%
>> For a significant
number of researchers,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:10%
at least some answers could very
well be found in a cathedral

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:10%
in Oviedo, Spain.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In chapter 20 of
the fourth Gospel,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:90%
we read how the two disciples--

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
the beloved disciple and Peter--
ran to the tomb on Easter

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
morning having heard
that the tomb was empty.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Now there's been all
kinds of speculation

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
as to the position
of the cloths--

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:90%
how they saw them.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:90%
But really that's unnecessary.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The original Greek text is
really quite clear on that.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other disciple
ran more quickly than Peter

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and came first to the
tomb and stooping,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:90%
sees lying the sheets.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Comes, therefore, also
Simon, Peter following him,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:90%
and entered the tomb.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And he beholds the sheets
lying and the kerchief,

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
which was on the hit of him,
not with the sheets lying,

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
but apart, having been
wrapped up in one place.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
What the researchers
and scientists

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
are hoping to establish is some
of what modern jurists call

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:90%
corroborative evidence.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Does the kerchief in
Spain somehow match up

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:90%
with the shroud in Italy?

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly enough,
the scientific studies

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:10%
to have been done
on the Sudarium

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.060 align:middle line:10%
do, in fact,
support the findings

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:10%
of the shroud researchers.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, modern
investigative techniques

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
permit the bloodstains
on the Sudarium

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to be superimposed over
those on the shroud.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%
The result is astonishing.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The stains coincide in
the three main things--

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the
blood group AB.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Second, stains corresponding
to the back of the head

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.545 align:middle line:90%
are blood that was shed in life.

00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
There are many
little stains that

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
were caused by some
kind of sharp object

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:90%
that penetrated the skin.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
By overlaying images
of the two cloths,

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the blood stains-- the
actual shape of the stains

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
does coincide, which leads to
another medical conclusion.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
These two cloths were used on
the same corpse as a purely

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:90%
scientific conclusion.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Now if it covered the same
corpse as the Shroud of Turin,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
well, obviously the shroud is
at least as old as the Sudarium.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But setting aside the
obvious similarities,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:84%
there is one very
important difference.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:10%
Unlike the history
of the shroud,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:10%
the history of the
Sudarium is undisputed.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:10%
And by firmly and
scientifically establishing

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:10%
a direct correlation
between the two artifacts,

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:10%
their value to the new quantum
physics is inestimable.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The modern controversy,
however, didn't really

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
begin until 1898 when a gifted
Italian photographer, Secondo

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Pia, was given unprecedented
permission by the king of Italy

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:90%
to photograph the shroud.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
What he caught on his two
glass photographic plates

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:90%
stunned the world.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The image on the cloth itself,
the faint, almost ghost-like

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
markings on the fabric,
actually appeared in reverse.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
A positive image came
up on what should have

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:90%
been a photographic negative.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
history, the likeness

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
could be seen in
full majestic detail.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And the correlation
between the image

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and the biblical description
of the crucifixion

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
was breathtaking
and unmistakable.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics and critics
immediately began to cry foul.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:10%
The very fact that
the image so closely

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:10%
resembled the biblical
description was, they said,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:10%
proof that it was a forgery.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:10%
Yet, the image is
so striking, so

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:10%
vivid that a modern forensic
analysis is possible.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Robert Buckland,
a former coroner

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and forensic pathologist
for Los Angeles County,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is well acquainted with
the signs of violent death.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a body of a 5 foot
11 inch Caucasian male weighing

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:90%
about 170 pounds.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
On the head, there
are blood flows

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
from numerous puncture
wounds on the front, back,

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and top of the head.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a swelling
over one cheek

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:90%
consistent with a beating.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The right wrist is
covered by the left hand.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's a puncture
wound in the left wrist

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
consistent with the
crucifixion injury.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
The classical artistic
and legendary portrayal

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
of nails through the
palms is incorrect,

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:84%
because the
structures in the hand

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
are too fragile to hold up the
weight of a man of this size

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:90%
without tearing free.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
There are streams of
blood running down

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:84%
both forearms originating
in the wrist areas

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and controlled by gravity.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So the blood flows
toward the elbows

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
with the arms elevated
and outstretched.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
On the back, there are
more than 100 lesions,

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:84%
which appear to be
scourge or whip marks.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Historians have
indicated that the Romans

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:10%
used a whip called a flagrum.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This implement had
two or three thongs.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And at their ends were
pieces of metal or bone,

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:84%
which looked like
small dumbbells.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see how those end
pieces from a Roman flagrum

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
fit precisely into this
scourge lesions on the body.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:10%
Here on the front of the
body is a large bloodstain

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:10%
resulting from
puncture of the chest

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:10%
by an instrument like
a lance or a spear.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
This weapon penetrated
the thoracic cavity

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
through the plural spaces
and into the heart.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Later after the corpse
was removed from the cross

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and turned, blood dribbled
out of the chest wound

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and puddled along the
small of the back.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
There was an abrasion on one
knee consistent with a fall.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Finally, a spike has been
driven through both feet.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And blood leaked
from those areas

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and has stained the cloth.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of a scourged
man who was crucified

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and who died of postural
asphyxia and cardiopulmonary

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:90%
failure is clear cut.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The corroborating evidence--
forensic, historical,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
scientific, and circumstantial
as the lawyers might say--

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
is clearly in support
of authenticity.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The circumstantial evidence
in support of the authenticity

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:10%
of the Shroud of Turin
is simply overwhelming.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:10%
In my professional
opinion, it would

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:10%
meet the most stringent
evidentiary requirements

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:10%
in a court of law beyond
a reasonable doubt.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the evidence with
the exception of the largely

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:84%
discredited carbon-14 test
gives the Shroud of Turin a far

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
greater claim to authenticity
than virtually any other

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
ancient artifact,
or for that matter,

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:90%
any other object on Earth.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But now scientists
say all of this

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.802 align:middle line:84%
connects to the latest
quantum physics.

00:28:25.802 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:84%
What is there about
the shroud that

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
binds these new scientific
discoveries to the old beliefs?

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
What of the single image bearing
fiber we spoke of earlier--

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:84%
does the image itself
carry information?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Have the secrets just
now coming to light

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific
world been hidden

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
in this stunning artifact
for hundreds of years?

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Could it be we have yet to
learn that the universe does not

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
necessarily work the way we have
always been taught that it did?

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So far we have been
able to establish

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
a scientific level
of authenticity

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:90%
for the Shroud of Turin.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have seen how
science is discovering

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:90%
a whole new realm of physics.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:10%
The question is how do these
two realities come together.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Could it be the answer
lies not with the fabric,

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:90%
but with the image itself?

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It is not simply
the fact that there

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
is an image on
this piece of cloth

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that has so captivated the
interest of scientists,

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
historians, and theologians.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It is the nature of the
image that is so profound.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:10%
>> The shroud image is made
from tiny fibers that are 1/10

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:10%
the size of a human hair.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And the picture elements are
actually randomly distributed

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:84%
like the dots in your newspaper
photograph or magazine

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:90%
photograph.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:10%
To do this, you would need
an incredibly accurate

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.880 align:middle line:10%
atomic laser.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:90%
This technology does not exist.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the official
published findings of the STRP

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
scientific team regarding
the shroud image,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
the actual image was created
by a phenomenon as yet unknown

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
or a momentous event that caused
a rapid cellulose degradation,

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:90%
aging, of the linen fibers--

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that is, an accelerated
dehydration and oxidation

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of the very top linen
fibrils of the cellulose

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
fibers of the shroud,
thereby creating

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:84%
a sepia or straw-yellow
colored image

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:90%
similar to that of a scorch.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the image
was caused by something--

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows what--

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that affected only the
very top of the fibrils

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that make up the fibers that,
in turn, make up the fabric.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:10%
>> After thousands of
hours of intense study,

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:10%
the world was left with yet
another scientific enigma--

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:10%
a piece of fabric that is
demonstrably hand-woven

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:10%
containing a surface anomaly
and the shape and form

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:10%
of a crucified man
created by some process

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:10%
of undetermined origin.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There are other
striking anomalies as well.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, it
has long been known

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that in addition to the explicit
detail of the body image,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
there are also other
images that were somehow

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:90%
transmitted onto the fabric--

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
specifically, the
image of flowers.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I first noticed the image of
flowers on the shroud in 1985.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I found what
they looked like, then

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I began looking more
closely and found that there

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:90%
were large numbers of these.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I went and got the
botany books of Israel

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and spent the next four years
trying to identify these flower

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.680 align:middle line:90%
images.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, I had
identified find these.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted a confirmation.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And so on a trip
to Israel in 1995,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I contacted Professor Avinoam
Danin, the world's authority

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
on the flowers of Israel, and
took some of our photographs

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:84%
When I handed the
photograph that I had first

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
spotted the flowers on to
him without indicating what

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
we had actually found, he looked
at it for about 15 seconds,

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
said, those are the
flowers of Jerusalem.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
He immediately knew that
this was a unique finding.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But once it was discovered
that there were other images

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.910 align:middle line:84%
on the shroud, Dr. Whanger began
looking closer and found that

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
there were small
coins on each eye.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:34.320 align:middle line:84%
What significance could
that possibly have?

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Alan Whanger in his
book, "The Shroud of Turin:

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Adventure in
Discovery," points out

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.440 align:middle line:90%
that not only are they there.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.480 align:middle line:84%
They present distinct
and profound clues

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
as to the date in
origin of the image.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The Father Francis Filas
was professor of the theology,

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.670 align:middle line:90%
as well as a--

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.170 align:middle line:84%
a scientist who investigated
the Shroud of Turin,

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
as well as a photographer.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:84%
He was working with a
group of researchers

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
who were attempting to identify
that what the projections are

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:84%
over the eyes were--
thinking they might be coins.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Filas had an
enlargement and made

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:10%
of the excellent photographs
they had of the shroud

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:10%
and noticed a patterning
over the right eye.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:84%
On an enlargement
of this, he noticed

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that there were letters
which he interpreted as UCAI

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and something that looked
like a shepherd's crook.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This is typical of the leptin
or the widow's might struck

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:90%
by Pontius Pilate in the years--

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:90%
in 29 AD to 33.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We can identify
the images of them.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:10%
And so we can identify
the particular coin

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:10%
and know the origin as
well as the date, which

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:10%
for both of them that we
identify were struck in 29 AD.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So this dates the shroud
back to the first century.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It also localizes that to Israel
since that these coins are just

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.943 align:middle line:84%
the widow's might or the
common penny of the time,

00:33:57.943 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and certainly would
not circulate either

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
outside of Israel or not
very long after the reign

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of Tiberius Caesar to
which they were dedicated.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
>> But how could an image
containing so much information

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:90%
have been formed?

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:84%
There are those who believe
the image could only

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
have been formed by a burst
of some sort of radiation.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But the simple fact is nothing
like the shroud image has ever

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.870 align:middle line:90%
been found or reproduced.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's only the beginning
of the astounding information

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
to be gleaned from
this amazing image.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:84%
In spite of skeptics
and setbacks,

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
scientists continue
their search.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And Dame Isabel Piczek,
a particle physicist,

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:84%
believes the shroud
has brought science

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to the threshold of a whole
new understanding of physics.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
While dealing with the position
of the body within the cloth,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
she discovered one of those
mysterious properties that

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:90%
cannot be, yet somehow is--

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
an interface that divides
the image transport into two

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
hermetically separate yet
simultaneous actions and forces

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:84%
causing the shroud to be taut
and parallel on both sides,

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:90%
creating a true event horizon.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In general relativity,
we have found that there are

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:84%
certain things
called black holes.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:10%
Now the surface of a black hole
is called an event horizon.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's called that because
right at that surface--

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
right at that surface
the laws of physics

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
seem to change
character drastically.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look at the
image of the shroud--

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:10%
the two bodies next
to each other--

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.690 align:middle line:10%
you feel that it's a flat image.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:42.036 align:middle line:10%
But if you create, for instance,
a three-dimensional object as I

00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:43.810 align:middle line:10%
did-- the real body--

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.596 align:middle line:10%
then you realize that there--

00:35:46.596 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:10%
there is a strange
dividing element,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:10%
an interface from which
the image is projected up.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:10%
And the image is projected down.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:10%
The muscles of the body
are absolutely not crossed

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:10%
against the stone of the tomb.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:10%
They are perfect.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:10%
It means that the body is
hovering between the two

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.450 align:middle line:10%
sides of the shroud.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.800 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:10%
That there is
absolutely no gravity.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Other strange things you
discover-- that the--

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:10%
the image is
absolutely undistorted.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:10%
Now if you imagine that
the cloth was wrinkled,

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.950 align:middle line:10%
tied, wrapped around the
body and all of a sudden

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:10%
you see a perfect image,
which is impossible

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:10%
unless the shroud was
made absolutely taut--

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.060 align:middle line:10%
rigidly taut.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:10%


00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:10%
Everybody thinks that
the tomb signifies death.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:10%
Not at all-- the exact opposite.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:10%
The shroud and
the tomb signifies

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:10%
an unbelievable
beginning, because the--

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:10%
in the depth of the
collapsed event horizon,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:10%
there is something which
science knows as singularity--

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:10%
that this is exactly
what started the universe

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:10%
in the Big Bang.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:10%
We have nothing less
in the tomb of Christ

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:10%
than the beginning
of a new universe.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> For centuries, the shroud
has been viewed and analyzed

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:90%
as a record of a death--

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
the end of the physical being.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But Isabel Piczek is
suggesting that it is, in fact,

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
just the opposite-- a
record not of an ending,

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:84%
but a beginning, which
would suggest Resurrection

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:90%
in its truest sense.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Dame Piczek, this

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is the starting base
for the new physics.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But is Isabel Piczek
out on a limb of physics

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:90%
where no one else wants to go?

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps not-- recently
a group of scientists

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:84%
trying to identify
those things that

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.120 align:middle line:84%
are fundamental
to the way nature

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.420 align:middle line:84%
works made some
startling discoveries.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Edgar Mitchell--
the sixth man

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:10%
to walk on the moon, founder
of the Institute of Noetic

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:10%
Sciences, author, and
lecturer explains.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The classical traditional
model in physics,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:10%
which began in Newtonian
times describes how particles

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:10%
and atoms and molecules
move and recombine.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Even most of the 20th
century, physicists

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.450 align:middle line:84%
only looked at the
particle aspect of it

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and did not really
concentrate very much

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.070 align:middle line:90%
on the informational aspect.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's only really
with the quantum hologram

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have brought
information up

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to a par of importance
with energy itself

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and with physicality
so that we understand

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
we live in not only

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
exists because of
its physicality,

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's understood because
of this information.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
powerful new concept.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And all physical bodies have
such a holographic emission

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that is available
non-locally, which

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:11.120 align:middle line:84%
means throughout the universe,
non-locally at all times.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be the event horizon
demonstrated by the image

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:84%
on the shroud sent information
instantaneously throughout

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:90%
the universe?

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And does this mean
that the Resurrection

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:90%
was a universal event?

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Physics has achieved
a lot of success.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And we think that we have
pretty much everything.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
we know we don't.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.010 align:middle line:90%
We know there are missing links.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We know there are puzzles
and infinities cropping up

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.210 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, people are
working to find some answers.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But in spite of our
successes, there

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.310 align:middle line:84%
are still some
mysteries abounding.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Some scientists believe the
characteristics of the image

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:10%
on the shroud, such as
three-dimensional information

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:10%
from a two-dimensional
photograph,

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:10%
the negative aspect
of the image,

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:10%
and the fact that the image that
appears on the cloth virtually

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:10%
free of distortion are
basically holographic.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The quantum hologram is
merely a method of describing

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the total emissions from an
object very much like if you

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.960 align:middle line:90%
look at your fingertip.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Then you look at one
of the little swirls

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:90%
on your fingertip.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tell you
very much about you.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the swirls
on all 10 fingers all at once,

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:90%
that's your fingerprint.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And it uniquely defines
you and identifies you--

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the same thing with
a quantum hologram.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The emissions from
a physical object

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:84%
when studied as a whole
uniquely identify events

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in the history of that object.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.838 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.838 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that events
in the history of the Shroud

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of Turin are still there for
us to discover, decipher,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.475 align:middle line:90%
and understand?

00:41:04.475 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:84%
If the essence of physical law
is informational, then perhaps

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the image on the
shroud has given us

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
not only a record
of the Resurrection,

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
but a description
of creation as well.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
instead of science

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
proving the shroud is authentic
the image on the shroud

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is proving the accuracy
of the science?

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
In the quest for
scientific authenticity,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.930 align:middle line:84%
has the miraculous meaning of
the shroud been rediscovered?

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:10%
What would it mean to the
world if scientific research

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:10%
and the faith of
generations could join hands

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:10%
in perfect harmony?

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Up to this point,
the evidence seems

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that the
1988 carbon dating

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
of a small piece of
the shroud fabric

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.480 align:middle line:84%
was at best compromised and
at worst completely useless

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in addition to which, compelling
corroborative evidence has been

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:84%
examined that places the shroud
and this Sudarium of Oviedo

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:02.590 align:middle line:90%
on the same body.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Ongoing research,
meanwhile, has uncovered

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.690 align:middle line:84%
a number of other
scientific anomalies

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.900 align:middle line:84%
that place the shroud squarely
over the body of Jesus

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Christ at the time of
his Resurrection early

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
in the first century, and
at the same time squarely

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.950 align:middle line:84%
at the center of a 21st
century scientific paradigm.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:84%
This suggests a
new understanding

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:27.890 align:middle line:84%
of our place in the universe
and how it all began.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
We have also seen that
scientists are now

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:84%
coming to grips with a
whole new basis of physics

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to the
way nature works.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:10%
In one of the most exciting
discoveries to date,

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.030 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Petrus Soons points
out that there is more--

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:10%
perhaps much more to
this piece of fabric

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:10%
than meets the eye, even
peering through a microscope.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:84%
In 1931, Giuseppe Enri, a
professional photographer,

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:84%
was commissioned to make
a photographic record

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud in connection
with a royal event, which

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.020 align:middle line:84%
meant many photographs
would be taken.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Soons reasoned that if
the negatives of these photos

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.440 align:middle line:84%
also contained
three-dimensional information,

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.290 align:middle line:84%
a full hologram of the
image might be possible.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:16.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I contacted Dr. Alan
Whanger and his wife, Mary,

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:10%
because I knew that he was under
possession of second and third

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.150 align:middle line:10%
generation copies of the
negatives of the photographs

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:10%
that were made in 1931
by a doctor [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:90%
a professional photographer.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:84%
He made available
these negatives to me.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I brought them to
Holland and in cooperation

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:84%
with the Dutch
Holographic Laboratory,

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:90%
we digitalized them.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And if a professional
looks at negatives,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.310 align:middle line:84%
he can see how much
information is in it.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:46.823 align:middle line:84%
So we estimated that it would
be about 200 to 300 megabyte.

00:43:46.823 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:10%
But it proved to be that
most of the negatives

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:10%
had information up
to 1 gigabyte, which

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:55.790 align:middle line:10%
means 4 time the informations
that we estimated.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:59.970 align:middle line:84%
There could be still hidden
in these digitalized files

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:03.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information that
we still don't know about.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.660 align:middle line:10%
>> At first glance, we
might think that negatives

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.920 align:middle line:10%
of photographs taken some 75
years ago would be less likely

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.580 align:middle line:10%
to yield usable data
than modern photographs.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember that
the techniques used back then

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.080 align:middle line:84%
required much longer exposure
times and more light, which

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:25.670 align:middle line:84%
means there is very likely much
more information on the 1931

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Enri negatives than on any of
the more modern photographs.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Soons took the negatives
to a holographic science

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.630 align:middle line:84%
laboratory in Amsterdam to
see if they would be willing

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:90%
to test his theory.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I came there with my
photographs and told them there

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:84%
was 3D information in it, they
were very skeptical about it,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.420 align:middle line:84%
because normally you don't make
a hologram of a photograph.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.928 align:middle line:90%
Then they started experimenting.

00:44:49.928 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:10%
And they found out
that it could make

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:10%
a hologram of this material.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:10%
>> To correctly view these
specially processed images

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.550 align:middle line:10%
of the holograms, please
use your 3D glasses.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>> It is very important
to notice also that we

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:10%
didn't change any data.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:10%
So all the information that
is in the digitized files

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.122 align:middle line:10%
is also in the holograms.

00:45:12.122 --> 00:45:13.580 align:middle line:10%
What we did in the
laboratory is we

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:10%
checked the whole shroud
for existing 3D information.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:10%
the only 3D information
that we have found

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:10%
was in the image of the body.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:10%
All the rest that, for
example, Dr. Alan Whanger

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:10%
has discovered, for
example, the flower images--

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.315 align:middle line:10%
that was a different
imaging process.

00:45:28.315 --> 00:45:30.440 align:middle line:10%
So basically you talk about
three different imaging

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:10%
processing in the shroud--

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:36.080 align:middle line:10%
that is, the blood,
which was direct contact.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The second was what Dr.
Alan Whanger has found--

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.850 align:middle line:84%
for example, the flowers
that could have been Corona

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:42.650 align:middle line:90%
discharge.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.810 align:middle line:10%
But it is-- was a
complete different process

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:48.210 align:middle line:10%
than the image formation
of the body itself.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to realize
that no other two-dimensional

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.630 align:middle line:84%
image in existence has
been shown to contain

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:56.900 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional
holographic information.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole body of holograms
gave us the possibility

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to see the image of the man
on the shroud and/or angles

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.712 align:middle line:90%
that had never been seen before.

00:46:04.712 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We could confirm a
couple of the findings

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.350 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, the
round little objects

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.390 align:middle line:84%
on top of the eyelets
that have been

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.340 align:middle line:90%
interpreted as being coins.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.630 align:middle line:90%
We cannot see inscriptions.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But we can confirm that they
are solid metal objects.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And point of controversy
has always been the position

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:84%
of the legs, because you
cannot see that very well

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:90%
in the photographs.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.840 align:middle line:84%
On the hologram, of course,
it shows extraordinarily well.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.330 align:middle line:10%
The left leg was stretched.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:10%
The foot was put in a diagonal
position fixed to the cross.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:10%
And then the other foot--

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.200 align:middle line:10%
the right foot-- was put
straight in a vertical position

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.450 align:middle line:10%
on top of the other foot.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:43.830 align:middle line:10%
That's why the leg is banded.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:10%
And it was used one nail both
feet and fix them to the cross.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:10%
>> The hologram provided
yet another surprise for Dr.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:10%
Soons and his associates--

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:10%
one they are only now
beginning to explain.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The most exciting things that
we found in that hologram was

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.785 align:middle line:90%
under the beard in the neck.

00:47:03.785 --> 00:47:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It was known already
that it was a wide line.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But nobody could ever
say what that exactly

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.920 align:middle line:90%
meant than what it was.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a solid object.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It is in the form like
something like an amulet

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that was put there.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Now after studying
it for quite a while,

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I could figure out that there
were letters on it on top

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.230 align:middle line:90%
sticking out a little bit.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it turns out that that
information on that plaque is

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:84%
evident in some photographs
and not in others.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And the people at the Eindhoven
holographic lab in the Holland

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:46.752 align:middle line:84%
found that slight variations
in focusing distance

00:47:46.752 --> 00:47:47.960 align:middle line:90%
brought that information out.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So on one photograph where
we had this information it

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.030 align:middle line:84%
was just by pure luck that
everything was right there,

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:90%
captured it.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And what's that that
is suggestive of

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is that there is infinite--
different information

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.050 align:middle line:84%
at different depths
into this image.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Peter Soons thought
he saw letters there.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:10%
And he talk with a--

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:12.570 align:middle line:10%
a rabbi and a
scholar, who is fluent

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.780 align:middle line:10%
in the Aramaic and Hebrew.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:10%
And the letters are apparent.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:22.190 align:middle line:10%
And they translated those into
a meaningful phrase, which says

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:26.090 align:middle line:10%
a lot about who this might be.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Now these letters are ABA--

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:34.790 align:middle line:84%
aleph bet aleph, which is the
word aba, which means father.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Now seeing the circumstances
here and where the emulate is,

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:43.400 align:middle line:84%
that makes a lot of
sense, because Christ

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
used to call himself
also the Son of God,

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:50.150 align:middle line:84%
the Son of the Father,
the Son of the Holy One.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So it is like saying the
amulet that was put probably

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.040 align:middle line:84%
by the apostles over there, like
saying, here is the Son of God.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.820 align:middle line:10%
>> This information is going
to have to be checked out.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:05.005 align:middle line:10%
But if it were confirmed,
this would just

00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:10%
be along the line of several
other things that have

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.510 align:middle line:10%
been written just recently--

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, literally hot
off the press books--

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.100 align:middle line:10%
that are saying in
early Christianity

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.660 align:middle line:10%
two messages were preached
from the very beginning--

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.420 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is divine.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And He was raised from the dead.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Those two go-- are right
there at the beginning.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.420 align:middle line:90%
They didn't come decades later.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
the same proclamation

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.060 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the
gospels and in Paul.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that it
is possible, after all,

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to prove that this is not only
an authentic first century

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
cloth, but was, in fact, the
burial shroud of Jesus Christ?

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.040 align:middle line:90%
But there was more--

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:84%
in fact, there was much
more still to come.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.740 align:middle line:10%
Tom D'Muhala, while examining
the hologram close up,

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.840 align:middle line:10%
asked Dr. Soons if a single
fibril from the image

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:10%
area of the shroud was
sufficient for determining

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.540 align:middle line:10%
whether the image contained
holographic information--

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.885 align:middle line:10%
that is, if the shroud
itself was a hologram.

00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:02.100 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The answer had
exciting implications.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> First, it's important to
understand what a hologram is.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Basically, a
hologram is a pattern

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:15.570 align:middle line:84%
of interacting microscopic rings
or interference fringes not

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.957 align:middle line:84%
unlike the pattern created
when a handful of pebbles

00:50:17.957 --> 00:50:18.915 align:middle line:90%
are tossed into a pond.

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Every area of the
hologram sees and stores

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:84%
information about
the whole image.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:84%
If you break a hologram
into multiple pieces,

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:33.090 align:middle line:84%
you have multiple holograms,
each bearing information

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:90%
about the whole image.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is important for
the Shroud of Turin also,

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.640 align:middle line:84%
because the upper arms are
missing because of a fire

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.810 align:middle line:90%
in 1532.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:10%
So if what I believe there
is holographic information

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.910 align:middle line:10%
in the shroud, you would
be able to activate that.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.610 align:middle line:10%
You would see the whole body
of the man in the shroud,

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.340 align:middle line:10%
including the
missing upper arms.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Testing is still being done
to determine if, in fact ,

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.390 align:middle line:10%
the shroud image does carry
holographic information.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Soons has already seen
rings on the latest hologram

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud image suggesting
that this may be the case.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in the not
too distant future,

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:15.440 align:middle line:84%
we may be able to create a
full unblemished hologram

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.890 align:middle line:84%
from a very small area
of the shroud's image.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Indication of this can
come from a single fibril.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Having had a chance
to examine the holograms,

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:30.350 align:middle line:84%
we asked both Dr. Alan Whanger
and Tom D'Muhala to tell us

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.800 align:middle line:84%
if there's anything there they
hadn't seen before to give us

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
their impressions
of the new data.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The hologram does a
remarkable job of emphasizing

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.920 align:middle line:90%
certain features on the shroud.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It gives a astonishingly--
a three-dimensional aspect

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:46.510 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It makes some of the
features much more prominent.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, the scourge marks
that we see front and back

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.100 align:middle line:84%
are astonishingly
revealed in the holograms.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:10%
Also we see certain
parts of the body,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.610 align:middle line:10%
such as the toes,
some of the hair,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.900 align:middle line:10%
and actually we think that
possibly one the elbows

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.510 align:middle line:10%
on the holograms, which is
not really that apparent

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.427 align:middle line:10%
on the regular photographs.

00:52:13.427 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The discovery of the plaque
around the neck is particularly

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.460 align:middle line:90%
significant.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
identify and translate

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.830 align:middle line:84%
the letters into a
meaningful phrase

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:84%
suggest not only who
this person was, but who

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and what the people of that
time believed him to be.

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.650 align:middle line:10%
Slowly but surely, science
seems to be giving us

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.650 align:middle line:10%
the closest thing to literal
proof of biblical history

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:10%
the world has ever seen.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.500 align:middle line:10%
There are other things as well.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.800 align:middle line:10%
For example, we can
clearly see there

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:10%
is no distortion of the
dorsal or backside image.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.950 align:middle line:10%
The fact supports
Isabel Piczek's theory

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.840 align:middle line:10%
of a true event horizon.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Had the body been lying on
rock when the image was formed,

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.775 align:middle line:84%
distortion would have
been unavoidable.

00:52:53.775 --> 00:52:55.400 align:middle line:84%
There are several
remarkable attributes

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to the shroud evident here that
aren't discussed very much.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious is
that it is still here,

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that it has survived
through fire, flood,

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and the ravages of time.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And even though it has presented
the faithful and scientists

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.430 align:middle line:84%
alike with considerable
challenges,

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:13.160 align:middle line:84%
it still has a message
for all mankind.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
The more we work with
it, the more we discover,

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and the more we come
to realize that this

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:23.080 align:middle line:84%
could be a record of the literal
Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The shroud is the
most astonishing object

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that's in existence,
most intensely studied,

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and the one that has the most
important information for we

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.920 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.390 align:middle line:84%
We have no question that
this is Jesus of Nazareth.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And we feel that the event,
which occurred approximately 30

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.720 align:middle line:10%
to 36 hours after death
with the body disappearing

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.890 align:middle line:10%
within the folded
shroud indicates

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:48.340 align:middle line:10%
that some unique event, which
we call the Resurrection

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.880 align:middle line:10%
had taken place--

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.440 align:middle line:10%
probably the most
pivotal event in history,

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:10%
which is exemplified and
witnessed by the shroud.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>> At least as far as the
Shroud of Turin is concerned,

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:02.240 align:middle line:10%
science--

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:10%
once thought to be the
enemy of all things

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:09.170 align:middle line:10%
religious-- now seems to be
enjoying a new role as partner

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.270 align:middle line:10%
in uncovering the truth.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of the
scientific, archeological,

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:84%
or theological
determinations, people

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:19.820 align:middle line:84%
have come to their own
conclusions about the shroud--

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:84%
what it is and where it came
from, and the meaning it

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:middle line:90%
holds for them.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.710 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time,
it seems unlikely

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:31.790 align:middle line:84%
that carbon-14 tests or
polarized light microscopes

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:84%
or any of the other so-called
tests advanced by the skeptics

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.450 align:middle line:84%
will do much to change
their conclusions.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably this gift comes
directly from Jesus if we also

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:49.790 align:middle line:10%
want to say that it appeared
at a certain moment of history.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.830 align:middle line:10%
And meanwhile, we are
not able to explain

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:10%
the origin of the
image, which continues

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.725 align:middle line:10%
to be a great mystery.

00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:57.680 align:middle line:10%


00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.740 align:middle line:10%
The shroud always remains
an instrument of Providence,

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.340 align:middle line:10%
given to the church to announce
in a rather more sensitive way

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:09.650 align:middle line:10%
also in an exterior way that
great mystery of a love that

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:10%
could not be greater.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But could it be that the
image on the shroud is telling

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.850 align:middle line:84%
us there is something
beyond death?

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Until modern times, science
has not concerned itself too

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.380 align:middle line:84%
much with how we
know what we know.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.510 align:middle line:90%
It's based upon information.

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But science has not looked
at the subjective experience,

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:39.030 align:middle line:84%
nor exactly how we
perceive what we perceive.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:43.230 align:middle line:84%
But this quantum holographic
development and understanding

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.610 align:middle line:90%
is changing all of that.

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:48.930 align:middle line:10%
That helped us get a new
handle on how information

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:10%
is utilized in living
organisms-- something we've

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:10%
never had before.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The researchers and
scientists continue to explore

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:90%
all possibilities.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Shroud of
Turin has apparently

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.830 align:middle line:84%
given the scientific
world a whole new quantum

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:90%
paradigm to think about.

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This astonishing
artifact has brought

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.150 align:middle line:84%
to light a whole new world
of scientific and religious

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.220 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Is the Shroud of Turin, in
fact, a physical and scientific

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.250 align:middle line:84%
record of what has
been regarded up

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:24.700 align:middle line:84%
until now as a purely
spiritual event

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the literal Resurrection
of Jesus Christ?

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Could it be, as Dame
Piczek suggests,

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:84%
the evidence of a new
beginning and the threshold

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of a revolution in physics
that can open the door

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to the meaning of the universe?

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.880 align:middle line:10%
Or does it suggest the
existence of some unknown force

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.440 align:middle line:10%
still waiting to be explored?

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.310 align:middle line:10%
For two millennia, a mysterious
image on this piece of cloth

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:55.960 align:middle line:10%
has comforted the faithful
and puzzled the skeptic.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Now with hundreds of
thousands of man hours

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.930 align:middle line:84%
devoted to scientific analysis
of the shroud, perhaps

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.840 align:middle line:90%
we can draw some conclusions.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Since nothing even
remotely approaching

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.760 align:middle line:84%
the image on the shroud
has ever been found,

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.510 align:middle line:84%
it seems fair to suggest
the image was intended

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.861 align:middle line:90%
to be a message to mankind.

00:57:15.861 --> 00:57:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And if all of this is
true, wouldn't that

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.420 align:middle line:84%
suggest the message
of the shroud

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:84%
might simply be a
message of hope.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.320 align:middle line:84%
As each new scientific
discovery enhances

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.760 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of the image of the
shroud, it seems to be saying,

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.440 align:middle line:90%
look closer.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I have given truth to the world.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Bring it into the light.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that the
haunting beauty of a hologram

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:48.010 align:middle line:84%
is the final clue to the true
identity of the man portrayed

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.140 align:middle line:84%
