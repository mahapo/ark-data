00:00:01.546 --> 00:00:05.556
(flowing water)

2
00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.536
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:17.585
<v Voiceover>Many of the world's greatest stories</v>

4
00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:19.376
begin with a journey.

5
00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:23.771
A quest to answer life's most intimate questions.

6
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.161
"Where do we come from?"

7
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.091
"Why are we here?"

8
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.521
From the dawn of time, all cultures have created stories

9
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:38.362
to help explain the ultimate nature of things,

10
00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:42.077
and perhaps a new story is emerging in our time.

11
00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:44.773
One grounded in contemporary science and yet

12
00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:48.822
nourished by the ancient religious wisdom of our planet.

13
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.952
What if the universe, even the Earth itself,

14
00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:57.688
has its own unique story to tell?

15
00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:00.699
One in which we play a profound role.

16
00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:08.070
(triumphant music)

17
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.071
(boat horn)

18
00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:32.388
We're on the Greek island of Samos.

19
00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:34.688
Just a mile off the coast of Turkey.

20
00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:37.348
We could tell the story of the universe anywhere.

21
00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:40.024
Each place would offers its own unique possibilities

22
00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:43.044
for the telling but we chose Samos because it's one of the

23
00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:45.839
great crossroads of human history.

24
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:50.139
Europeans, Asians and Africans have all made their way here.

25
00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.278
And by telling the story on an island,

26
00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.654
surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea,

27
00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:58.825 line:15% 
we will be reminded that we live on this shining planet

28
00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:02.416 line:15% 
sailing through the great ocean of the universe.

29
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.562
And there's another reason we have come to Samos

30
00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:11.222
and that is because 2,600-years ago

31
00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.016
Pythagoras was born here.

32
00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:16.656
Pythagoras, a mathematician and philosopher,

33
00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:18.976
was one of the first humans to realize

34
00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:21.696
that the harmonies and relationships in the universe

35
00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.046
could be given expression using numbers.

36
00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.897
The current of thought he generated led eventually

37
00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:31.942
to all of modern mathematical science.

38
00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:36.671
He was also a great teacher.

39
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:41.052
In fact legend has it that he invented the word philosophy,

40
00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:43.062
a word of wisdom.

41
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.592
We'll spend a day here on Samos.

42
00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.012
Before the clock strikes midnight,

43
00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.991
we will have recounted the great events

44
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:00.967
of our 14-billion-year cosmic evolution.

45
00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:04.448
Our immense journey told in a single day

46
00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:07.178
on one of Earth's magical islands.

47
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:12.708
How did it all start?

48
00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.248
An awesome question, certainly,

49
00:03:15.248 --> 00:03:18.448
but it appears there really was a beginning.

50
00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.427
Some scientists refer to this as the Big Bang,

51
00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:24.747
I like to call it the Great Flaring Forth.

52
00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:28.227
Imagine the universe beginning like this.

53
00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:33.003
(ominous tones)
(roaring flame)

54
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:36.919
14-billion-years ago, everything in the universe,

55
00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.659
all the bright matter of the stars and galaxies

56
00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.518
as well as all the dark matter no one has ever seen,

57
00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:47.499
all of it existed in a single point so energetic it was

58
00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.328
trillions of degrees hot.

59
00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.979
Instantly this micro-universe rushed apart,

60
00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.881
even faster than the speed of light.

61
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.310
The discovery that the universe has expanded

62
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.351
and is still expanding is one of the greatest

63
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.171
of human history.

64
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:11.311
The common understanding had been that the universe

65
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:13.430
is simply a vast space,

66
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.771
a vast space in which things existed.

67
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:19.771
Large things like galaxies and small things like atoms.

68
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:22.491
Scientists knew that matter changed form in the universe

69
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.950
but everyone assumed that the universe as a whole

70
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.930
was not changing.

71
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.341
But no.

72
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.847
The universe is changing, and has changed dramatically.

73
00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:36.738
The universe has a story.

74
00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:38.358
A beginning,

75
00:04:38.358 --> 00:04:40.318
a middle where we are now,

76
00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:44.268
and perhaps in some far-distant future, an end.

77
00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:54.118
In the 1920's, the cosmologist Edwin Hubble

78
00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:58.393
trained his 100-inch telescope at the night sky.

79
00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:01.033
He was trying to determine if our Milky Way was the

80
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.199
only galaxy in the universe.

81
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.429
Not only did he discover the universe is filled

82
00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.669
with galaxies, he also determined that all of them

83
00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.439
are rushing away from each other.

84
00:05:14.308 --> 00:05:17.309
With Hubble's work, humanity learned that the universe

85
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.388
began with a massive explosion that has been

86
00:05:20.388 --> 00:05:24.498
carrying the galaxies apart for billions of years.

87
00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:30.779
(exotic music)

88
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.548
Another special quality about the universe

89
00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:36.568
is the rate of expansion.

90
00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:39.299
If the rate of expansion had been slower,

91
00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.679
even slightly slower,

92
00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.079
even a millionth of a percent slower,

93
00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:51.915
the universe would have recollapsed immediately.

94
00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:54.661
That would have been it.

95
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:57.981
After a million-years, the universe would have imploded

96
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.066
upon itself and formed a massive black hole.

97
00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:04.175
On the other hand, if the universe has expanded

98
00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:05.662
a little more quickly,

99
00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.542
even slightly more quickly,

100
00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.051
even, calculations show,

101
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:16.761
one-millionth of 1% more quickly,

102
00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:22.032
the universe would have expanded too quickly

103
00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:23.352
for structures to form.

104
00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:26.543
It would have simply exploded.

105
00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:29.323
There would have been no galaxies, no structure,

106
00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:32.632
no life, nothing but dust for all time.

107
00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:37.183
So what we've discovered is that we're living in a universe

108
00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:40.303
that is expanding at exactly the rate necessary

109
00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:43.173
for life and structure to come forth.

110
00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:47.863
It could be then that even though we can't call

111
00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:50.023
the early universe "alive,"

112
00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:53.127
we can understand it as life-generating.

113
00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:58.117
One of the physicists who is reflecting on this

114
00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.878
is the celebrated Freeman Dyson

115
00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:04.678
and he mused that the more

116
00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:08.278
he reflected on the structures of the early universe,

117
00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:11.618
the more he became convinced that in some sense

118
00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:14.518
the universe must have known from the very beginning

119
00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.443
that life was coming.

120
00:07:19.893 --> 00:07:22.574
The light from the beginning of time

121
00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:26.164
has been travelling for 14-billion-years.

122
00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:30.959
Meanwhile, life has been evolving.

123
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.790
With the recent emergence of advanced technology,

124
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.710
we are at last able to see the story these photons tell

125
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.950
about the birth of the universe

126
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.679
and where we ultimately come from.

127
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.850
Morning on a Greek island is like the first day of creation

128
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.549
and wandering around here you feel like

129
00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:58.489
the first person.

130
00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:00.969
Inevitably, humans would ask,

131
00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.770
"What gave birth to all of this beauty?"

132
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.990
"What was the form of creativity

133
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.280
"that brought this forth?"

134
00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:13.130
Consider galaxies.

135
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.389
What brought the galaxies forth?

136
00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:18.350
You know, even a century ago, this is hard to imagine,

137
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.889
we didn't know if there were two galaxies

138
00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:21.329
in the entire universe.

139
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:24.621
That was a main focus of attention among scientists.

140
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:27.021
Now we know there are 100-billion,

141
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:30.337
maybe even a trillion galaxies.

142
00:08:30.337 --> 00:08:33.178
What is the creativity that brought forth

143
00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:35.548
a trillion galaxies?

144
00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:43.618
Let's consider our own Milky Way galaxy.

145
00:08:43.618 --> 00:08:47.057
It's a galaxy with huge spiral arms.

146
00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:50.338
Now when we first began to discover galaxies,

147
00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:52.738
we thought maybe these spiral arms

148
00:08:52.738 --> 00:08:54.817
were composed of physical matter.

149
00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:57.037
But actually it's much more interesting.

150
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.938
The arms are actually waves that are passing through

151
00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:01.258
the galaxy.

152
00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.698
They're called density waves and as they pass through

153
00:09:03.698 --> 00:09:07.608
clouds of hydrogen and helium, they ignite star birth.

154
00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:12.818
That's the way to picture the Milky Way galaxy.

155
00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.057
Not so much as a thing,

156
00:09:15.057 --> 00:09:17.098
but rather as an activity.

157
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.958
It's an ongoing activity of bringing forth stars.

158
00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.943
We live in the midst of this intense creativity.

159
00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:30.442
(flowing water)

160
00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.567
Come into this little church, I want to show you something.

161
00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:38.398
(serene music)

162
00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:43.825
The ceiling, as you can see, is filled with stars.

163
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.626
The same is true of most of the churches

164
00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.626
on the island of Samos.

165
00:09:47.626 --> 00:09:49.826
The ancient Greeks, like Pythagoras,

166
00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:51.426
thought the stars were alive.

167
00:09:51.426 --> 00:09:53.406
Even divine.

168
00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:55.958
Throughout history, every culture has been stunned

169
00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.168
by the presence of stars in the vastness of the night sky.

170
00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:10.318
So deeply moved by the majesty emanating

171
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.198
from the brilliance of the stars,

172
00:10:12.198 --> 00:10:14.238
we have built our lives around them.

173
00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:16.838
We've even organized entire civilizations

174
00:10:16.838 --> 00:10:19.348
upon their beauty and order.

175
00:10:22.598 --> 00:10:24.898
Here's the essence of the universe story.

176
00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:28.357
The stars are our ancestors.

177
00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:30.763
Out of them everything comes forth.

178
00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:34.993
Stars are dynamic entities.

179
00:10:34.993 --> 00:10:38.375
They're born, they develop, they even die.

180
00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.425
Star birth occurs when gravity squeezes together

181
00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:45.745
a cloud of atoms so tightly that nuclear fusion

182
00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:48.266
ignites in the center.

183
00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.507
In the process, hydrogen fuses into helium.

184
00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:55.817
This nuclear energy expands outwards

185
00:10:55.817 --> 00:10:58.257
and opposes gravity.

186
00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:02.017
So stars represent an amazingly creative balance

187
00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:05.017
between the powers of gravitational collapse

188
00:11:05.017 --> 00:11:07.146
and nuclear explosion.

189
00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:12.457
And once a star's nuclear fuel is spent, there's nothing

190
00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:15.917
left to prevent gravity from collapsing inwards

191
00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:18.962
causing the death-spiral to begin.

192
00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.893
This super-concentrated dot of matter

193
00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:24.372
which we call a supernova,

194
00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:28.958
explodes outward with the power of 100-billion stars.

195
00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:33.909
And as it expands, it creates all of the elements.

196
00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:37.465
Phosphorus, oxygen, carbon, gold.

197
00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:41.915
These are spewed out into the Milky Way galaxy

198
00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:44.895
and then the whole process starts again.

199
00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:47.756
They drift as a cloud and then they collapse,

200
00:11:47.756 --> 00:11:51.516
give birth to a star, the Earth.

201
00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:55.435
It's by this stupendous process that we can say,

202
00:11:55.435 --> 00:11:58.545
"The stars are our ancestors."

203
00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:03.626
(exotic music)

204
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.791
It's just such an amazing discovery.

205
00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:22.930
The carbon atoms of this beet and of the lettuce

206
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.011
and of our brains, our skin,

207
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:30.861
all of it passed through an intense explosion of a star.

208
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.310
In pondering the source of the sun's power,

209
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.720
we can now reflect on something

210
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.340
no earlier humans could know.

211
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.680
The sun is converting four-million-tons of its mass

212
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.286
into energy every second.

213
00:12:49.796 --> 00:12:53.441
All of life feeds on the roaring energy of the sun.

214
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:57.811
Our solar system then is the self-energizing womb

215
00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.686
of creativity.

216
00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:03.266
And all of this had its start in a cloud of dust.

217
00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:07.337
(exotic music)

218
00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:25.056
(man singing in foreign language)

219
00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:36.706
It was really difficult for humans to realize that

220
00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:39.486
we live on a planet circling a star.

221
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.206
I mean we were here for hundreds of thousands of years

222
00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:46.686
before Aristarchus 2,000-years ago, right here on Samos,

223
00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:50.606
realized we are spinning around the sun.

224
00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:53.726
That was such an amazing insight

225
00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:56.246
that it vanished, actually.

226
00:13:56.246 --> 00:13:59.026
And it wasn't until Copernicus discovered it again

227
00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:00.826
in the 16th Century

228
00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:04.006
that humans really began to absorb the fact

229
00:14:04.006 --> 00:14:06.996
that we are on this planet.

230
00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:13.326
Let me use these vegetables to explain our solar system.

231
00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:16.661
So here we have the sun, this cabbage as the Sun.

232
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:18.261
Now, actually,

233
00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:20.661
if this was to be in scale,

234
00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:22.721
this cabbage would have to be a million times

235
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:24.621
the size of this pepper.

236
00:14:24.621 --> 00:14:27.121
Budgetary considerations made that impossible,

237
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:29.641
so you just have to use your imagination.

238
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:31.701
And what we've learned in the 20th Century

239
00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:34.401
is about the composition of the planets.

240
00:14:34.401 --> 00:14:37.241
First we have the large planets.

241
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:40.221
So we have Jupiter here, and we have Saturn

242
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.961
and Uranus and Neptune.

243
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:48.051
These are large enough to hold on

244
00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:50.191
to all the lighter elements so that

245
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:53.211
they actually are gaseous.

246
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:57.261
Too small to be a star but yet too large to be solid.

247
00:14:59.111 --> 00:15:02.611
The other kind then we have indicated here with these rocks.

248
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:05.931
So we have Mercury then we have Venus,

249
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.201
we jump over to Mars.

250
00:15:09.911 --> 00:15:14.031
These are the rocky planets most of which are solid.

251
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:17.431
But there's one special rocky planet.

252
00:15:17.431 --> 00:15:21.111
One that's not too small, and not too big.

253
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.671
One that's not too hot and not too cold.

254
00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:29.171
One that's not exactly solid but not exactly liquid.

255
00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:32.101
We call it home.

256
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.171
Earth is very much like an egg.

257
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.571
The core of the Earth is like the yolk.

258
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:44.531
The mantle of the Earth is like the egg white,

259
00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:47.731
and the crust of the Earth is like the egg shell.

260
00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:49.451
What happens is that,

261
00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:52.171
early on when the Earth is in a molten state,

262
00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:55.411
all of the really heavy elements like iron and nickel

263
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:59.171
sink into the core and then the elements like magnesium

264
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:03.631
form this outer layer around the core, the mantle.

265
00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:07.111
The crust is only 10 to 50-miles-thick

266
00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:09.544
and that's the only solid part of Earth.

267
00:16:09.544 --> 00:16:11.930
All the rest is in motion.

268
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.440
Plumes of molten rock will rise up from the mantle

269
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.580
and harden into plates that form the crust.

270
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.300
As these plates slide around the surface of Earth,

271
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.100
they collide and crumple into majestic mountain ranges

272
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.640
or they are forced back down

273
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.670
where they melt and sink toward the center of Earth.

274
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.960
This discovery, which originated with Alfred Wegener,

275
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.920
is called plate tectonics

276
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.590
and is one of the greatest of history.

277
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.780
Earth became encircled by great tidal oceans

278
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.330
and held by a thin layer of atmosphere.

279
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.900
A churning, volcanic Earth can now bring forth

280
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.710
the next wonder of existence.

281
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.550
The living cell.

282
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.280
How are we gonna tell the story of life?

283
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.040
How did it all begin?

284
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.200
What theory shall we offer to explain this?

285
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.080
The simple truth is that no one knows with full certainty.

286
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.560
But even though the detailed explanation still eludes us,

287
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.600
scientists have began to approach the whole question of life

288
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.660
from a radical new perspective.

289
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.580
That of self-organization.

290
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.820
You see, during the modern period we thought of the world

291
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.580
as machine-like and then life was an accident.

292
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.180
But now with the work of a number of chemists,

293
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.280
notably Ilya Prigogine who won a Nobel Prize for this work,

294
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.420
we are beginning to discover

295
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.200
the act of patterning in matter itself.

296
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.690
It's intrinsic to matter.

297
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.500
From this new perspective life is not an accident.

298
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.600
Life is inevitable.

299
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.260
A planet reaches a certain complexity of its matter,

300
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.690
and then life blossoms forth, quite naturally.

301
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.380
Consider whirlpools.

302
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.880
This spiral, swirling action can appear anywhere

303
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.950
so long as there is a body of liquid-moving-water.

304
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.460
It is not the water itself that endures as a spiral,

305
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.700
because the water molecules are constantly flowing

306
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.620
in and out of the whirlpool.

307
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.110
It is rather the emergent dynamic structure that endures.

308
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:49.118
(crashing waves)

309
00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:52.198
Such is the nature of life.

310
00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:55.608
The universe began as a great outpouring of cosmic breath.

311
00:18:55.608 --> 00:18:59.316
Cosmic energy that then swirled and twisted and complexified

312
00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:03.276
until it could burst forth into flowers and animals

313
00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:07.542
and fish and all of these elegant explosions of energy.

314
00:19:08.354 --> 00:19:12.372
But it's not just energy, and it's not just living energy.

315
00:19:12.372 --> 00:19:14.700
This is energy that is aware.

316
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.570
By awareness or sentience, we mean something that is

317
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.290
more than what takes place in the realm

318
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.450
of elementary particles and yet,

319
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.450
less than full human consciousness.

320
00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.230
So where does such awareness arise?

321
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.310
Some biologists are beginning to speculate that

322
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.890
awareness has its foundation in the very

323
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.760
self-organizing dynamics of the universe.

324
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.610
For cell biologist Ursula Goodenough,

325
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.270
this awareness is a kind of primitive discernment

326
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.990
and it reveals itself especially in the membrane

327
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.950
of each cell, that thin skin-like layer

328
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.200
that covers every cell.

329
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.040
(crashing waves)

330
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.210
If we had microscopes for eyes,

331
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.830
we could see it all happening right here

332
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.730
in these tide pools.

333
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.264
There millions of cells are swarming about

334
00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:18.424
and they're encountering molecules over and over again

335
00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:20.144
and with every encounter,

336
00:20:20.144 --> 00:20:21.924
discernment emerges.

337
00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:22.924
Why?

338
00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:25.004
Because a decision has to be made.

339
00:20:25.004 --> 00:20:27.564
An intelligent decision.

340
00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:30.444
Now up in the cliff over here there's an ancient castle

341
00:20:30.444 --> 00:20:32.094
that will help me explain.

342
00:20:35.304 --> 00:20:37.464
This church which is called Metamorphosis

343
00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:39.744
is nearly 1,000-years-old.

344
00:20:39.744 --> 00:20:42.424
Above it is a castle that once guarded entrance

345
00:20:42.424 --> 00:20:45.064
into the magical pitomi valley.

346
00:20:45.064 --> 00:20:47.804
The castle was built to do what membranes do.

347
00:20:47.804 --> 00:20:50.914
Let your friends in, keep your enemies out.

348
00:20:57.304 --> 00:20:59.864
The ongoing creativity of the universe

349
00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:03.552
is seen in the complex development of life itself.

350
00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.662
After it had circled the sun for hundreds

351
00:21:09.662 --> 00:21:13.500
of millions of years, Earth's most primitive organisms

352
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.150
developed molecules that would resonate with the sun.

353
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.280
How are we to picture this process involving Earth and sun

354
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.700
bringing forth photosynthesis?

355
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.980
As an engineering project?

356
00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.460
I guess.

357
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.900
But try a new metaphor.

358
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.080
Imagine two lovers longing for each other.

359
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.790
What is it they truly desire?

360
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.660
The relationship is charged with energy and promise.

361
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.628
There's the sun exploding with brilliance.

362
00:21:49.138 --> 00:21:52.666
There's the Earth, basking in the sun's rays.

363
00:21:55.256 --> 00:21:58.076
But Earth is not passive.

364
00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:01.276
Earth's systems attune to the sun.

365
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:03.476
Changing their molecule structures

366
00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:07.366
in order to draw in light and convert it to food.

367
00:22:10.856 --> 00:22:14.256
As the complexity of life deepens,

368
00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:17.846
entwinement itself also deepens.

369
00:22:26.736 --> 00:22:31.076
How are we going to tell the story of the living Earth?

370
00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:34.616
In particular, how are we going to tell the story of Earth

371
00:22:34.616 --> 00:22:36.166
to our children?

372
00:22:38.136 --> 00:22:40.276
This is especially important because

373
00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:42.476
in the last couple centuries,

374
00:22:42.476 --> 00:22:44.496
we have learned more about the Earth

375
00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:47.876
than in perhaps the previous 100,000-years.

376
00:22:47.876 --> 00:22:51.056
So the question is, how are we going to convey that,

377
00:22:51.056 --> 00:22:54.004
the essence of that, to the next generation?

378
00:22:55.134 --> 00:22:57.302
One thing is completely clear.

379
00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:01.178
The Earth is very different than what we thought.

380
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.418
The Earth is not a platform.

381
00:23:06.568 --> 00:23:08.458
It's not a background.

382
00:23:11.688 --> 00:23:14.578
In fact, the great discovery is this.

383
00:23:15.948 --> 00:23:19.528
Life doesn't exist on top of the Earth,

384
00:23:19.528 --> 00:23:21.388
life is a partner.

385
00:23:21.388 --> 00:23:25.816
To the oceans, to the atmosphere, to the land.

386
00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:29.586
For instance, if we look at the atmosphere,

387
00:23:29.586 --> 00:23:32.686
it is 21% oxygen.

388
00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:36.232
This makes us unique among all the known planets.

389
00:23:37.622 --> 00:23:40.742
The only reason we have oxygen in our atmosphere

390
00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:44.160
is that life is pouring it forth each day.

391
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.520
So the very composition of our air reflects the fact

392
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.350
that life is here.

393
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.550
In that sense, life is woven into the atmosphere.

394
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.380
But an even more radical hypothesis

395
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.950
is beginning to emerge in the minds of some scientists.

396
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.018
Perhaps Earth is not only an integrated system.

397
00:24:09.018 --> 00:24:12.258
Perhaps Earth somehow maintains itself

398
00:24:12.258 --> 00:24:14.528
so that life can flourish.

399
00:24:16.398 --> 00:24:18.138
Consider temperature.

400
00:24:18.138 --> 00:24:22.278
Life only exists in a very narrow band of temperature.

401
00:24:22.278 --> 00:24:25.278
So something like this temperature has been true of Earth

402
00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:27.208
for four-billion-years.

403
00:24:29.318 --> 00:24:31.958
Now scientists originally thought this was because the Earth

404
00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:36.316
just happened to be 93-million-miles away from the sun,

405
00:24:36.316 --> 00:24:40.476
but during the 1950's we learned about the fusion processes

406
00:24:40.476 --> 00:24:43.376
taking place in stars and so now we know

407
00:24:43.376 --> 00:24:47.396
the sun's temperature has increased by over 25%

408
00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:49.686
over the last four-billion-years.

409
00:24:53.676 --> 00:24:56.236
Which means, somehow,

410
00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:59.336
Earth has had to adapt itself to maintain

411
00:24:59.336 --> 00:25:02.636
that stable, narrow band of temperature.

412
00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:03.994
How?

413
00:25:03.994 --> 00:25:06.134
We know some of the details.

414
00:25:06.134 --> 00:25:08.634
Early Earth had 1,000-times the carbon dioxide

415
00:25:08.634 --> 00:25:09.994
as present-day Earth.

416
00:25:09.994 --> 00:25:13.774
So during that time, the Earth's system has drawn

417
00:25:13.774 --> 00:25:17.534
the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere

418
00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:20.374
forming for instance the shells of marine algae

419
00:25:20.374 --> 00:25:21.754
and then when the marine algae die

420
00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:23.834
the shells go to the bottom of the ocean.

421
00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:25.634
So more and more carbon dioxide is taken

422
00:25:25.634 --> 00:25:28.454
out of the atmosphere which enables the Earth

423
00:25:28.454 --> 00:25:31.498
to cool down while the sun heats up.

424
00:25:33.488 --> 00:25:35.408
But the question returns.

425
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:39.148
Is all of this being organized by the Earth as a whole

426
00:25:39.148 --> 00:25:41.216
so that life could flourish?

427
00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:47.066
If that's the case, then the atmosphere is not just stuff.

428
00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:51.046
It's something like a membrane.

429
00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:52.924
And we are not living on an Earth,

430
00:25:52.924 --> 00:25:57.744
we are actually participants in a vast, intricate system

431
00:25:57.744 --> 00:26:01.254
that is something like a living cell.

432
00:26:04.344 --> 00:26:07.692
A living cell has the power to learn through time.

433
00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:11.522
This is what distinguishes the first cells

434
00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:13.662
from all the other beings that existed

435
00:26:13.662 --> 00:26:17.040
prior to life's emergence.

436
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.880
A star for instance has the power to organize itself

437
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.580
for billions of years.

438
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.900
But throughout that time it never needs to learn

439
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.450
anything new.

440
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.560
Life learns.

441
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.720
For life can adapt itself to new situations

442
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.610
by changing its form and by remembering these changes.

443
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.660
Life remembers the past by storing information

444
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.850
in its DNA molecules.

445
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.320
It is this power of memory encased in each living cell

446
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.270
that enables life to learn and thus evolve.

447
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.840
One of the ways in which to understand the nature

448
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.080
of life's memory is by using the ideas

449
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.440
of the mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras.

450
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.680
You know, a number of Pythagoras' ideas were revolutionary

451
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.880
and like a lot of revolutionary ideas,

452
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.240
they weren't that popular.

453
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.220
In fact, Pythagoras had to hide from the tyrant Polycrates

454
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.500
who was in charge of Samos.

455
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.300
And tradition has it, this is where he hid, right here.

456
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.370
Half-way up the mountain in a cave there.

457
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.820
One of Pythagoras' central convictions

458
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.700
was that the essence of life is not air

459
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.000
or water or fire as the other Greek philosophers taught,

460
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.860
rather, the essence of life is number.

461
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.580
Pattern.

462
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.980
It seems such an odd idea, I mean,

463
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.340
life is so sensuous, it's so complex, so rich.

464
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.018
How can the essence of that be something abstract

465
00:27:54.018 --> 00:27:56.106
like number or pattern?

466
00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:00.816
It is precisely this deep connection between

467
00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:03.836
life and pattern that enables life to remember

468
00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:05.996
its crucial achievements.

469
00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:07.936
That's what DNA does.

470
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:10.856
In the precise sequence of the nuclear tides,

471
00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.646
DNA holds the essence of life.

472
00:28:14.896 --> 00:28:18.336
Life did not hand down the actual molecules to my body.

473
00:28:18.336 --> 00:28:21.476
Instead, life handed their essence

474
00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:24.116
in the form of genetic information.

475
00:28:24.116 --> 00:28:26.696
Because of this, our bodies can come alive

476
00:28:26.696 --> 00:28:29.606
a thousand different ways each day.

477
00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:33.306
Life has learned to learn.

478
00:28:43.976 --> 00:28:46.496
One of the central ways of learning for our species

479
00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:47.996
involves seeing.

480
00:28:47.996 --> 00:28:51.116
Life has invented so many different ways of seeing.

481
00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:55.156
The amazing thing is, this process is not yet over.

482
00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:58.216
Come with me into Pythagoras' cave.

483
00:28:58.216 --> 00:29:02.766
(ominous atmospheric music)

484
00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.657
Beginning billions of years ago,

485
00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:27.437
the earliest cells began to develop a sensitivity to light.

486
00:29:27.437 --> 00:29:29.995
They can sense it and move toward it.

487
00:29:29.995 --> 00:29:32.735
And it was this capacity that led eventually

488
00:29:32.735 --> 00:29:34.915
to the development of the eye.

489
00:29:34.915 --> 00:29:37.935
And the first eye of which we have any fossil evidence

490
00:29:37.935 --> 00:29:41.735
is that of the Trilobite, 500-million-years ago.

491
00:29:41.735 --> 00:29:45.795
The Trilobite, intent upon piercing through the darkness,

492
00:29:45.795 --> 00:29:49.125
invented an eye using calcite, a mineral.

493
00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:54.235
The Trilobite was able to see only in the direction

494
00:29:54.235 --> 00:29:56.333
of these rods.

495
00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:59.813
A primal form of seeing that proved so successful

496
00:29:59.813 --> 00:30:02.613
we find it even now in the compound eyes

497
00:30:02.613 --> 00:30:05.323
of flies and lobsters.

498
00:30:07.953 --> 00:30:10.713
An entirely different form of seeing was invented

499
00:30:10.713 --> 00:30:14.603
by the worms and carried forward by the fish.

500
00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:18.453
This type of eye is the one we know best

501
00:30:18.453 --> 00:30:21.053
for it's the one we inherited.

502
00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:23.763
The water-based eye.

503
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:29.173
Even after 500-million-years,

504
00:30:29.173 --> 00:30:32.233
eyesight continues to evolve.

505
00:30:32.233 --> 00:30:35.873
In humans, the power of seeing deepens

506
00:30:35.873 --> 00:30:38.313
with a new kind of sight.

507
00:30:38.313 --> 00:30:39.613
Insight.

508
00:30:39.613 --> 00:30:43.013
We see an inner screen of our imaginations.

509
00:30:43.013 --> 00:30:46.813
Life has learned yet another way of seeing.

510
00:30:46.813 --> 00:30:50.123
One with the power to transform everything.

511
00:30:51.393 --> 00:30:53.533
(majestic music)

512
00:30:53.533 --> 00:30:55.893
With this new way of seeing, we find ourselves

513
00:30:55.893 --> 00:30:59.761
blinking in a thrilling and yet unsettling light.

514
00:31:01.251 --> 00:31:03.731
Rooted in the center of immensities,

515
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:06.791
we open our eyes and see each thing anew,

516
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.651
each thing ablaze with the cosmic creativity

517
00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:11.561
billions of years old.

518
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:22.771
With the insights made possible

519
00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:24.571
with conscious self-awareness,

520
00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:27.711
our vision now extends back through billions of years

521
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.201
of evolution.

522
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:33.311
We see not only the scurrying spider

523
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:35.411
but the entire cosmic journey

524
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:38.169
layered into the spider's body.

525
00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:40.789
Including even the distant stars

526
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:43.049
out of whose explosions

527
00:31:43.049 --> 00:31:45.999
its molecules were constructed.

528
00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:56.109
And this capacity to see into the depths of time

529
00:31:56.109 --> 00:31:58.529
gives new meaning to death.

530
00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:02.347
(ominous music)

531
00:32:02.347 --> 00:32:04.727
The universe, throughout space and time,

532
00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:07.977
is filled with violence and chaos.

533
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:12.137
Millions of galaxies have been destroyed.

534
00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:17.557
Trillions of animals have been killed.

535
00:32:19.287 --> 00:32:22.667
Death and suffering are woven into the very heart

536
00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.377
of the universe.

537
00:32:25.947 --> 00:32:29.765
Usually such destruction is massive and senseless.

538
00:32:29.765 --> 00:32:32.345
A volcano erupts and kills every living being

539
00:32:32.345 --> 00:32:33.875
in its vicinity.

540
00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.645
But it can also happen that dealing with death

541
00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:47.873
leads to more complex, co-evolutionary relationships.

542
00:32:48.803 --> 00:32:52.951
For a rabbit, an eagle wears the face of destruction.

543
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:56.701
But in this relationship, the eagle develops

544
00:32:56.701 --> 00:32:59.661
more acute eyesight and the rabbit develops

545
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:02.111
greater speed for escape.

546
00:33:07.021 --> 00:33:11.331
Interdependent communities arise out of suffering and death.

547
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:16.771
The ultimate meaning of this escapes easy explanation.

548
00:33:19.001 --> 00:33:22.001
We are confronted with a fundamental mystery

549
00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:25.021
in which the small self of the individual

550
00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:28.791
dies into and nourishes the whole community.

551
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.889
But living beings are not just linked together by food.

552
00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:41.239
Passion.

553
00:33:41.239 --> 00:33:43.779
Our urge to merge.

554
00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:47.539
What could be more intimate to our souls?

555
00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:50.759
Our passions determine so much of our lives.

556
00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:54.719
They are the wild, explosive energies

557
00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:58.259
of all of love and creativity.

558
00:33:58.259 --> 00:34:02.309
And such desire resides at the very center of life.

559
00:34:05.379 --> 00:34:08.039
With fish, the female deposits her eggs

560
00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:10.759
and the male later fertilizes them.

561
00:34:10.759 --> 00:34:13.129
There's no contact between them.

562
00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.579
100-million-years later, when the lizards have evolved

563
00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:24.159
out of their fish and amphibian ancestors,

564
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.609
the passion to merge has deepened considerably.

565
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.379
With mammals and birds,

566
00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:34.667
passions reach yet a new crescendo.

567
00:34:35.997 --> 00:34:40.477
Not only are they able to co-mingle as one body,

568
00:34:40.477 --> 00:34:43.157
they can become so profoundly bonded

569
00:34:43.157 --> 00:34:46.847
they remain in the relationship their entire lives.

570
00:34:51.217 --> 00:34:53.697
We are not just similar to animals,

571
00:34:53.697 --> 00:34:56.357
we have been shaped by them.

572
00:34:56.357 --> 00:34:59.867
Our passions come from vertebrate evolution.

573
00:35:00.777 --> 00:35:03.217
Even our compassion can be understood

574
00:35:03.217 --> 00:35:05.457
as an expansion of what took place

575
00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:07.177
hundred of millions of years ago

576
00:35:07.177 --> 00:35:10.307
in the ocean with the early fish.

577
00:35:12.957 --> 00:35:16.797
Biologists speculate that mutations led to a mother fish

578
00:35:16.797 --> 00:35:19.565
who scared away predators from her babies.

579
00:35:20.575 --> 00:35:23.073
This behavior was new at that time.

580
00:35:23.073 --> 00:35:24.813
What was more common among fish back then

581
00:35:24.813 --> 00:35:27.263
was a mother who ate her young.

582
00:35:28.613 --> 00:35:30.893
With the emergence of the fish's descendants,

583
00:35:30.893 --> 00:35:34.121
mammals and birds, maternal care broadened.

584
00:35:35.231 --> 00:35:38.411
Now the offspring were not just protected from predators,

585
00:35:38.411 --> 00:35:41.501
but were nourished directly by their mother.

586
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:47.851
This care even included transmission of survival information

587
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:50.089
of their group.

588
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:53.659
And in some cases, this required years of training.

589
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:59.069
We see then the caring behavior among vertebrates

590
00:35:59.069 --> 00:36:02.029
expanding for 500-million-years

591
00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:05.239
before the emergence of homo-sapiens.

592
00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:12.449
Earlier humans intuited this deepening compassion

593
00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:14.849
and celebrated it with images

594
00:36:14.849 --> 00:36:17.399
of the divine feminine.

595
00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:30.229
As we enter into evening here on Samos,

596
00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:32.549
we approach one of the deep mysteries

597
00:36:32.549 --> 00:36:36.567
at the center of every traditional cosmic story.

598
00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:40.457
The nature and ultimate meaning of the human.

599
00:36:43.927 --> 00:36:47.307
We humans have our origin in the birth of the universe

600
00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:49.787
14-billion-years ago.

601
00:36:49.787 --> 00:36:53.227
And thus we are composed of the same energy and quanta

602
00:36:53.227 --> 00:36:57.227
as that which composes everything in the universe.

603
00:36:57.227 --> 00:36:59.667
And we follow from the first cell

604
00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:02.807
emerging four-billion-years ago.

605
00:37:02.807 --> 00:37:06.495
So we're genetic cousins to every living being.

606
00:37:08.485 --> 00:37:11.405
So what is distinct about us?

607
00:37:11.405 --> 00:37:13.815
What is uniquely human?

608
00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:24.605
Our current best evidence suggests that

609
00:37:24.605 --> 00:37:26.285
something took place between

610
00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:29.385
six and seven-million-years ago in Africa.

611
00:37:29.385 --> 00:37:32.065
Something happened to ignite the human lineage

612
00:37:32.065 --> 00:37:33.925
in the primate world.

613
00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:36.885
A new line of energetic apes emerged that would,

614
00:37:36.885 --> 00:37:40.505
over several million years, bring forth massive brains

615
00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:44.425
and learn to dwell on a world saturated with dreams.

616
00:37:44.425 --> 00:37:48.105
Nothing like them had every existed before.

617
00:37:48.105 --> 00:37:51.225
So, what gave rise to us?

618
00:37:51.225 --> 00:37:52.705
We don't really know.

619
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.285
We don't have the detailed knowledge

620
00:37:54.285 --> 00:37:56.105
of that transformation yet.

621
00:37:56.105 --> 00:37:58.865
We're forced to speculate on the data.

622
00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:02.905
And perhaps that's entirely appropriate here in the night

623
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:05.145
to be forced to dream about the

624
00:38:05.145 --> 00:38:08.205
origins of this dream-making animal.

625
00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:10.265
One theory offered by the scientist

626
00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:12.045
is particularly fascinating.

627
00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:15.079
It suggests that humanity has its origin

628
00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:17.359
in the prolongation of childhood.

629
00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:20.179
(gentle upbeat music)
(children's chatter)

630
00:38:20.179 --> 00:38:22.899
The idea is that mutations took place

631
00:38:22.899 --> 00:38:25.957
which slowed down our development.

632
00:38:25.957 --> 00:38:28.097
Humans went through the same phases as say,

633
00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:31.257
the chimpanzees, but they remained in each stage

634
00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:34.055
for a longer period of time.

635
00:38:34.055 --> 00:38:37.635
In particular, this meant that the humans were child-like

636
00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:40.745
for more of their lives than other mammals.

637
00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:47.615
So, to understand what makes a human human,

638
00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:51.545
we can study the children of any mammalian species.

639
00:38:52.575 --> 00:38:54.855
They jump to play.

640
00:38:54.855 --> 00:38:57.715
They explore the world with their eyes.

641
00:38:57.715 --> 00:39:00.913
And they taste the world with their mouths.

642
00:39:00.913 --> 00:39:04.273
Simple existence thrills them.

643
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:09.731
Their actions are, in some sense, free.

644
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:15.381
So, after nearly four-billion-years an animal emerged

645
00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:18.421
that could remain free, spontaneous,

646
00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:21.741
curious, flexible, open,

647
00:39:21.741 --> 00:39:24.461
impelled to try everything.

648
00:39:24.461 --> 00:39:27.171
So what was going to happen now?

649
00:39:28.981 --> 00:39:33.811
Early humans awoke to an incandescent consciousness.

650
00:39:33.811 --> 00:39:37.037
But where other animals were controlled by instincts,

651
00:39:37.037 --> 00:39:40.365
humans were liberated from such set reactions.

652
00:39:42.015 --> 00:39:44.395
Captivated by the thrill of movement,

653
00:39:44.395 --> 00:39:47.095
we could make dance,

654
00:39:47.095 --> 00:39:50.485
or sports central to our lives.

655
00:39:52.495 --> 00:39:54.395
Astonished by the sounds of Earth,

656
00:39:54.395 --> 00:39:58.123
we could dedicate ourselves to the joy of making music.

657
00:40:03.613 --> 00:40:05.243
Or making love.

658
00:40:15.873 --> 00:40:18.273
The greatest creation in human history

659
00:40:18.273 --> 00:40:21.033
was what enabled humans to plunge into

660
00:40:21.033 --> 00:40:24.723
and to share their super-abundant consciousness.

661
00:40:25.933 --> 00:40:29.001
This new invention was language.

662
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:33.041
More simply, the symbol.

663
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:37.551
The symbols of language

664
00:40:37.551 --> 00:40:39.451
and art and mathematics,

665
00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:42.431
opened up new depths of consciousness.

666
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:47.131
Each human began to carry an entire universe within.

667
00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:49.451
This new form of consciousness,

668
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:51.231
called symbolic consciousness,

669
00:40:51.231 --> 00:40:53.541
would soon change everything.

670
00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:59.151
(bell tolls)

671
00:40:59.151 --> 00:41:01.931
A crucial step in the process of becoming human

672
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:04.691
was learning to externalize consciousness.

673
00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:06.431
To represent in the physical world

674
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:09.011
what we had experienced within.

675
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:12.091
This is the Archaeological Museum on the island of Samos.

676
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:13.779
Come and have a look.

677
00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:19.807
By creating marks on bone or in wet clay,

678
00:41:19.807 --> 00:41:21.827
humans invented a way to fix their knowledge

679
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:25.807
into an enduring form outside of themselves.

680
00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:28.767
The coding processes of life were bursting beyond

681
00:41:28.767 --> 00:41:31.205
the DNA molecule.

682
00:41:31.205 --> 00:41:34.185
So with human culture, experience itself

683
00:41:34.185 --> 00:41:36.425
can be remembered and passed down

684
00:41:36.425 --> 00:41:39.385
for thousands of years.

685
00:41:39.385 --> 00:41:41.825
Not just successful mutations,

686
00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.745
any valuable understanding,

687
00:41:43.745 --> 00:41:46.725
even if experienced by a single human being

688
00:41:46.725 --> 00:41:49.575
can become part of the enduring legacy.

689
00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:54.225
Works of the mind and spirit flowed into Samos

690
00:41:54.225 --> 00:41:57.005
from every direction of the ancient world.

691
00:41:57.005 --> 00:41:59.065
From Athens and Mesopotamia

692
00:41:59.065 --> 00:42:01.851
as well as Spain, Egypt, Persia.

693
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:06.281
You know, in the early universe, concentrations of matter

694
00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:08.321
led to the emergence of galaxies

695
00:42:08.321 --> 00:42:11.381
and something similar was going on here.

696
00:42:11.381 --> 00:42:14.481
In Samos and in other cities we find a concentration

697
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:18.421
of symbolic constructions.

698
00:42:18.421 --> 00:42:20.501
What does this mean really?

699
00:42:20.501 --> 00:42:23.361
It means that rare insights

700
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:25.781
and deep feelings from around the planet

701
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:27.681
and from different eras of time

702
00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:30.781
are all folded together here.

703
00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:34.101
Out of this powerful, alchemical mixing,

704
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:37.731
human consciousness complexified into new forms.

705
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:47.081
Just think of it.

706
00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:51.481
For billions of years, rocks were just rocks.

707
00:42:51.481 --> 00:42:53.921
And then, in a geological instant,

708
00:42:53.921 --> 00:42:57.321
all over the planet they began to appear with these

709
00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:59.479
scratchings on them.

710
00:42:59.479 --> 00:43:03.259
Even more amazing, these little marks were organizing

711
00:43:03.259 --> 00:43:06.357
entire civilizations.

712
00:43:06.357 --> 00:43:08.457
With the appearance of the human,

713
00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:13.017
the coding process of life burst beyond the DNA molecule

714
00:43:13.017 --> 00:43:16.587
and began carving its information into stone.

715
00:43:21.617 --> 00:43:24.097
Symbols not only enabled humans to

716
00:43:24.097 --> 00:43:26.197
accumulate knowledge through millennia,

717
00:43:26.197 --> 00:43:29.257
they also offered a final and explosive possibility

718
00:43:29.257 --> 00:43:31.237
for human emergence.

719
00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:34.517
Symbols enabled humans to concentrate their consciousness

720
00:43:34.517 --> 00:43:37.697
upon consciousness.

721
00:43:37.697 --> 00:43:40.577
This was a development with magnificent

722
00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:43.377
and yet unexpected consequences.

723
00:43:43.377 --> 00:43:47.777
Like a magnifying glass focusing the sunlight upon a leaf,

724
00:43:47.777 --> 00:43:50.615
symbols set fire to human possibility

725
00:43:50.615 --> 00:43:53.725
that had slumbered for 100,000-years.

726
00:43:57.591 --> 00:43:59.811
Look at this colossal form.

727
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:02.091
It's almost 15-feet-high.

728
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:05.111
Now imagine dozens of such statues.

729
00:44:05.111 --> 00:44:07.811
As the Greeks moved and lived among them,

730
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.631
their self-conceptions would be changed.

731
00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:13.771
They would begin to imagine they were god-like.

732
00:44:13.771 --> 00:44:15.491
Capable of anything.

733
00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:17.891
Such systems we call in science,

734
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:19.691
self-amplifying loops.

735
00:44:19.691 --> 00:44:22.071
Consciousness giving birth to symbols

736
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:24.811
which then magnify consciousness.

737
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:27.901
In this way, humans are not simply evolving,

738
00:44:27.901 --> 00:44:30.149
they were consciously participating

739
00:44:30.149 --> 00:44:32.469
in giving birth to themselves.

740
00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:34.009
And what was coming forth

741
00:44:34.009 --> 00:44:36.489
was a planet-altering species.

742
00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:39.609
For this activity was taking place not simply here

743
00:44:39.609 --> 00:44:41.449
on the ancient island of Samos,

744
00:44:41.449 --> 00:44:45.157
but actually throughout the planet in every civilization.

745
00:44:46.147 --> 00:44:50.287
Super-charged with confidence coming from the reverberations

746
00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:53.727
of such symbols, human presence burst forth

747
00:44:53.727 --> 00:44:56.745
and altered the very face of the planet.

748
00:44:59.875 --> 00:45:03.293
Pyramids rose up from the African desert.

749
00:45:03.293 --> 00:45:06.793
Ancient rivers were diverted.

750
00:45:06.793 --> 00:45:09.433
Land as large as the eye could see was watered

751
00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:12.673
by irrigation systems.

752
00:45:12.673 --> 00:45:15.393
Even the forest scattered across the oceans

753
00:45:15.393 --> 00:45:17.703
in the form of sailing vessels.

754
00:45:19.213 --> 00:45:21.673
For the first time in Earth's history,

755
00:45:21.673 --> 00:45:25.053
seeds were not subject to the vagaries of climate

756
00:45:25.053 --> 00:45:27.613
but received their watery nourishment

757
00:45:27.613 --> 00:45:31.963
with the precision and inevitability of logical thought.

758
00:45:33.813 --> 00:45:36.533
Soon even the inner-order of the seeds

759
00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:39.521
was captured by the science of genetics.

760
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:44.431
What does it mean when even the seeds

761
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:47.151
begin to live not just in the Earth

762
00:45:47.151 --> 00:45:50.841
but in an Earth shaped by human consciousness?

763
00:45:56.391 --> 00:45:58.791
With their equations and their measurements,

764
00:45:58.791 --> 00:46:01.451
the early scientist discovered truths

765
00:46:01.451 --> 00:46:04.771
none of the classical scholars had known.

766
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:09.579
In astronomy, chemistry, physiology,

767
00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:11.827
humans began to understand the world

768
00:46:11.827 --> 00:46:14.437
with their numbers and patterns.

769
00:46:16.787 --> 00:46:20.005
(ominous music)

770
00:46:20.005 --> 00:46:22.225
The defining characteristic of this new

771
00:46:22.225 --> 00:46:24.365
modern form of consciousness

772
00:46:24.365 --> 00:46:27.765
was the decision to employ our science and technology

773
00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:31.235
to control nature for our own use.

774
00:46:37.065 --> 00:46:39.805
The wide-spread conviction of the industrial world

775
00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:43.315
was that nature was inferior to us.

776
00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:47.045
Such a world view in which only humans

777
00:46:47.045 --> 00:46:50.565
have sentient feelings allowed all of nature

778
00:46:50.565 --> 00:46:53.145
to become nothing more than a resource

779
00:46:53.145 --> 00:46:56.535
we could exploit in any way we wished.

780
00:46:59.705 --> 00:47:01.645
Even Rene Descartes,

781
00:47:01.645 --> 00:47:05.345
the most significant philosopher of the modern age,

782
00:47:05.345 --> 00:47:08.185
believed that when animals made crying sounds

783
00:47:08.185 --> 00:47:10.165
they were not suffering,

784
00:47:10.165 --> 00:47:13.995
they were simply malfunctioning machines.

785
00:47:16.525 --> 00:47:19.225
Humans were gaining control of Earth's processes

786
00:47:19.225 --> 00:47:20.725
and to what purpose?

787
00:47:20.725 --> 00:47:22.185
To create a better world.

788
00:47:22.185 --> 00:47:25.105
To eliminate hunger, to provide for our children.

789
00:47:25.105 --> 00:47:26.645
To have fun!

790
00:47:26.645 --> 00:47:28.485
And to fulfill this dream we poured forth

791
00:47:28.485 --> 00:47:31.385
all of our energies, all of our technologies,

792
00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:33.645
and with stupendous results.

793
00:47:33.645 --> 00:47:38.055
In the blink of an eye we exploded to seven-billion humans.

794
00:47:43.325 --> 00:47:45.405
The irony of it all,

795
00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:47.005
housing and feeding this many humans

796
00:47:47.005 --> 00:47:50.205
has already gutted our oceans and forests.

797
00:47:50.205 --> 00:47:52.285
We've ended up achieving something like the opposite

798
00:47:52.285 --> 00:47:54.225
of what we dreamt of.

799
00:47:54.225 --> 00:47:57.025
It's not just that we're using up all the energies of Earth,

800
00:47:57.025 --> 00:47:58.785
it's much deeper than that.

801
00:47:58.785 --> 00:48:01.325
We're changing life's dynamics

802
00:48:01.325 --> 00:48:03.905
and in an irreversible way.

803
00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:08.383
(roaring flames)
(somber music)

804
00:48:08.383 --> 00:48:10.623
We're just beginning to realize

805
00:48:10.623 --> 00:48:12.623
that over the last few decades we have

806
00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:17.073
profoundly altered the evolutionary dynamics of Earth.

807
00:48:18.943 --> 00:48:20.333
The air.

808
00:48:21.883 --> 00:48:23.393
The climate.

809
00:48:24.383 --> 00:48:25.833
The rivers.

810
00:48:27.483 --> 00:48:28.933
The oceans.

811
00:48:30.783 --> 00:48:33.293
Even the DNA.

812
00:48:34.223 --> 00:48:36.463
We live on a different planet now.

813
00:48:36.463 --> 00:48:39.503
A planet where not biology but symbolic consciousness

814
00:48:39.503 --> 00:48:42.463
is the determining factor for evolution.

815
00:48:42.463 --> 00:48:45.243
This great reversal has taken place.

816
00:48:45.243 --> 00:48:47.783
In the far-distant past, life drew forth

817
00:48:47.783 --> 00:48:50.283
symbolic consciousness.

818
00:48:50.283 --> 00:48:52.183
But now symbolic consciousness

819
00:48:52.183 --> 00:48:54.671
has seized control of life.

820
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:57.921
With our languages and our machines

821
00:48:57.921 --> 00:49:00.931
we have become as powerful as the planet itself.

822
00:49:03.621 --> 00:49:06.871
Because of us, ice caps are melting.

823
00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:15.641
Because of us, coral reefs the size of mountains

824
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.731
are bleaching white.

825
00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:22.341
But nothing shows this disaster more clearly

826
00:49:22.341 --> 00:49:25.321
than life itself.

827
00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:28.501
Because of us, thousands of species are going extinct

828
00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:30.091
each year.

829
00:49:32.701 --> 00:49:35.781
Nothing this devastating has taken place on Earth

830
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:38.341
since the extinction of the dinosaurs

831
00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:40.871
65-million-years ago.

832
00:49:43.201 --> 00:49:45.281
We are faced with a collective challenge

833
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:48.871
no previous generation even contemplated.

834
00:50:02.361 --> 00:50:06.451
(melancholic orchestral music)

835
00:50:08.661 --> 00:50:12.301
How are we to use this symbolic consciousness

836
00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:14.861
to create a human presence that will enhance

837
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:18.351
the well-being of the Earth community?

838
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:36.001
We are beginning to understand the profound powers

839
00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:37.669
of the universe.

840
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:41.259
And just as these powers have brought forth

841
00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:45.239
galaxies, stars, and life itself,

842
00:50:45.239 --> 00:50:47.979
perhaps the universe is now unfolding towards some

843
00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:49.729
new destiny.

844
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:55.739
What if our ultimate destiny is to experience the universe

845
00:50:55.739 --> 00:50:58.739
so deeply we come to realize that we are

846
00:50:58.739 --> 00:51:02.589
in some sense the mind and heart of the universe?

847
00:51:06.639 --> 00:51:10.739
Our deepest yearning is for a whole-hearted participation

848
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:12.609
in this flourishing.

849
00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:20.199
As we float in the midst of such mysterious immensities,

850
00:51:20.199 --> 00:51:22.579
is there any deep wisdom

851
00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:25.579
that might help us align our consciousness

852
00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:28.729
with the grain of cosmic evolution?

853
00:51:31.659 --> 00:51:34.119
Wonder will guide us.

854
00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:36.979
The human species has a genius for becoming astounded

855
00:51:36.979 --> 00:51:39.479
by almost anything in the universe.

856
00:51:39.479 --> 00:51:41.209
What can this mean?

857
00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:48.007
The body of the universe gave birth to our bodies.

858
00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:53.557
The self-organizing dynamics of the universe

859
00:51:53.557 --> 00:51:55.747
gave birth to your minds.

860
00:51:58.117 --> 00:51:59.685
We belong here.

861
00:52:01.135 --> 00:52:03.225
We've always belonged here.

862
00:52:06.115 --> 00:52:08.153
These deep discoveries of science are leading

863
00:52:08.153 --> 00:52:11.191
to a new story of the universe.

864
00:52:11.191 --> 00:52:14.301
It's a story that can be summarized in a single sentence.

865
00:52:15.251 --> 00:52:17.831
Over the course of over 14-billion-years,

866
00:52:17.831 --> 00:52:21.671
hydrogen gas transformed itself into

867
00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.489
mountains,

868
00:52:23.489 --> 00:52:25.449
butterflies,

869
00:52:25.449 --> 00:52:27.589
the music of Bach,

870
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:29.359
and you and me.

871
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:35.409
And these energies coursing through us

872
00:52:35.409 --> 00:52:39.299
may indeed renew the face of the Earth.

873
00:52:48.249 --> 00:52:52.379
(wondrous orchestral music)
