everyone in the class

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:10%
learned to swim, except me.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:10%
It was because I was very
sensitive to the water

in my face and in my ears.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:10%

head under because, gee,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:10%
I'd been told a million
times, don't drown,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:10%
don't go too near the water,
you might fall in and drown.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
supposed to put my head in it?

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:10%
So that's the kind of conundrums
that sensitive children

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:10%
get into because they're
being asked by their parents

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:10%
to do things that are hard for
them but easy for other kids.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the parents
go into this place of,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong with my kid.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%

>> Like many sensitive children,
Elaine excelled in school

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and went on to earn
her master's degree,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and then her doctorate
in psychology.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So as both a psychologist
and a sensitive person,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
she was listening carefully
when that counselor told her

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.149 align:middle line:90%
she might be highly sensitive.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That's when I decided
to do these interviews.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They You put up
posters and said,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
are you highly sensitive
or introverted.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time I thought,
maybe this is introversion.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Another source of
information about this

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
came to me through
the clinical world

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.217 align:middle line:84%
and through Carl Jung,
who studied introversion.

00:06:05.217 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it
was the same thing.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:90%
So I did these interviews.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I quickly discovered for one
thing that 30% of these people

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:90%
were extroverts.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't studying
introversion,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.482 align:middle line:90%
I was studying something else.

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> While Elaine was focusing her
research sensitivity in adults,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
others were researching it
in animals and children.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Unbeknownst to each other, they
were all on the same track.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:10%
A revolution was in the making.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I began to look at other
places where temperament was

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:10%
studied with
infants and animals.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The biologists were saying
that this trait persisted

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
in humans and over 100
other species, and about 20%

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:84%
of individuals in each
species, because it

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
has survival advantages
in situations where

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:90%
paying attention is valued.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:10%
20% of individuals
in all these species

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:10%
couldn't possibly represent
a disorder or simply

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:10%
a disadvantage for survival.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:10%
>> And Elaine Aron, of course,
not working with children,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:10%
working with adults, came to the
notion of the sensitive person.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:10%
And the sensitive person had
many of the characteristics

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:10%
that my work in child
development pointed out

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:10%
would make a person more
sensitive, being in the infant

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:10%
and toddler case highly
negative emotional and difficult

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:10%
temperament, i.e.,
appearing to have a highly

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.275 align:middle line:10%
sensitive nervous system.

00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, would you
say you cry easily?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a variety of
theories about the details

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.386 align:middle line:84%
are springing up, waiting
for more scientific research.

00:07:36.386 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Our observation, our theory
and belief about these highly

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:10%
reactive, biologically
susceptible children is that

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:10%
that susceptibility grows out
of a combination of genetic

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and environmental influences.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:10%
We believe, for a

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:10%
that are grounded in
solid science now,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:10%
that children, even in the
womb, even in prenatal life,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:10%
are sensing things about the
environment in which they're

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:10%
going to be born, and are
adjusting, moving up and down,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:10%
their responsivity to
various characteristics

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:10%
of the environment based
on that anticipation.

very important to me.

00:08:42.384 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's always been important
to me because I've always

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.915 align:middle line:90%
been drawn to animals.

00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
And I've always felt very close
to them, and the sensitivity,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:10%
of course, because I can
empathize with them because I

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:10%
went through it myself.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:10%
And I see in my
behavior practice

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:10%
how often animals are not
understood in their needs,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:10%
and I think they're
suffering because of that.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And they often
don't have a choice

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
but to suffer or to show
it as a behavior problem

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
so that they need
more understanding

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
of the environment to help cope.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And ideally of
course if you could

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
catch that before
they develop problems

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and you could adapt your
interactions, your environment,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to the animal, you
might be able to prevent

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:90%
some problems from happening.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's very
important to me,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and what I like about
Elaine Aron's work,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not defined as
something wrong or a pathology

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:84%
or a sickness or an illness
or a disease or a syndrome.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a personality
that's just a bit different.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And it has its positive
sides as well, not just

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:90%
its negative sides.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And what Elaine recognized
early on is that this is

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:10%
a trait that has
both ups and downs.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:10%
And she also recognized
that the core of that

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:10%
was not being upset by
things, but noticing things

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:10%
more intensely.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm pleased
about these results.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They're so varied, and people
find that quite amazing.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The trait was being studied
extensively in rhesus monkeys

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Stephen Suomi at the
National Institutes of Health

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
in Maryland, who is world
famous for his research.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.657 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.657 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>> We can see some real
similarities between

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:10%
the individual humans that
Elaine Aaron calls sensitive,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:10%
highly sensitive,
and the monkeys,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:10%
those individual monkeys that
we call uptight in that they are

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:10%
both very responsive to minor
changes in their environment.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They pick up things
in their environment

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that other monkeys and other
people largely miss or ignore.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And we think that
this is in part

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:84%
due to some
underlying differences

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.365 align:middle line:90%
in their genetic makeup.

00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When you study sensitivity
eventually converge,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
even though working in different
contexts and sometimes using

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
different terms, my specialty
has always been the study

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:90%
of the process in adults.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:10%
One advantage of studying
adults is that you cannot study

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.105 align:middle line:10%
the process without brain
scans or using questionnaires.

00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Adding the task of explaining
the truth to the public,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
which seemed impatient to
hear more about the research,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Elaine wrote "The Highly
Sensitive Person,"

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
an international bestseller
which has been translated

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
into 18 languages.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Something of a
movement has grown up

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.955 align:middle line:84%
around those who call
themselves, quote, "HSPs,"

00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
with all the intended discussion
of it on the internet,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
much of it useful and
some of it way out there.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
To help clarify what she sees
as the essence of the trait

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
in 2012 in her book
for professionals,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
she summarized the
trait as having

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:84%
four key characteristics,
using the acronym DOES.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
This stands for
Depth of processing,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Overstimulation, strong
Emotions and empathy,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and Sensitivity to subtleties.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>> HSPs showed more activation--

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Than the non-HSPs.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the four characteristics,
this strategy of processing

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:10%
or reflecting on information
more deeply or elaborately is

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:10%
most basic.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:10%
It's behind all the
sensitive behaviors

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:10%
one sees in animals
and children.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Yet deep processing cannot
in itself be actually seen.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I observed both my
son and my nephew

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
on their first day
of preschool standing

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.709 align:middle line:90%
at the back of the room.

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew they weren't
afraid, they were

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
watching, because they'd never
seen so many children and toys

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
in one place.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But both times, the teachers
walked up to them and said,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
oh, are you afraid, are you shy.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And so those labels
kind of fell onto them.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So labels of fearfulness
and all these difficulties

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
are applied to sensitive people,
even when they don't apply.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:10%
>> If you identify kids that
show a particular behavior,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:10%
and the behavior
might be very quiet,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:10%
you might easily come to think
that this is a shy kid and make

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:10%
certain assumptions
about what that means.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
You might think the
kid isn't interested,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
or you might assume the
kid is not bright enough

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:90%
to pick up what's going on.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:90%
But those could all be wrong.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It might just be that this
is a highly sensitive kid.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a kid who observes
quietly and takes things in,

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
very behaviorally

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
outgoing and easily readable.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi sweetie,
how are you doing?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to play
with them a little bit?

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I was never understood
when I was a child at home.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody listened to
me, what I had to say,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and cared about how I
felt. It was not important.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I was crazy and I
was too sensitive

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and I was taking
things too deeply--

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and stop crying, and just
constantly pushed away,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
so I was by myself.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:10%
And I was always called the shy
person, I was the introvert.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:10%
I would always sit
back and I would watch.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Shyness is the fear
of social evaluation.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's often been
mixed up with sensitivity

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
because lots of sensitive
people can become shy.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Because they're a minority.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:10%
And therefore people often
treat them a little differently

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:10%
because maybe they're
overstimulated

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.555 align:middle line:10%
when they show up at a party
and they don't have anything

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:21.386 align:middle line:10%
to say.

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So when a child is
introverted or shy,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:10%
or someone what we
call slow to warm up,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:10%
all of those things can
be misinterpreted as being

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:10%
something autistic or
on the autistic scale,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:10%
or even Asperger-ish, when
indeed there's nothing going

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:10%
on here around
Asperger's or autism.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:10%
There's been a
misdiagnosis and the child

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.165 align:middle line:10%
is simply highly sensitive.

00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, we do not want
to imply that every case

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
of shyness or what's
called social phobia,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
or every case of autism, in
which you also see a problem

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
with overstimulation, or a
case of any other disorder,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is actually always a highly
sensitive individual who was

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
misdiagnosed and is really
just highly sensitive.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
error we can make--

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
someone could think that
a symptom is entirely

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
due to high sensitivity
when it really

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:90%
is a sign of a real disorder.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And the third possibility
is that a person

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:84%
is highly sensitive
and has a disorder too.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:10%
Gaining more clarity
about this trait

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:10%
is what makes the
research so important.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And parents who are not sure
can always get an evaluation.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get an evaluation
from someone who only sees

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
autism spectrum disorder
and knows nothing about

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.077 align:middle line:84%
temperament, just as you
wouldn't want to take the child

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to someone only knew
about temperament

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't
recognize Asperger's.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Elaine feels none of her
results would have reached

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
the light of day without
her husband, Art Aron,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
a well-known researcher of
love, as well as of sensitivity,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
perhaps best known for his
36 questions from one of his

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
studies that then went viral
as a method to fall in love.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
At Stony Brook
University, he and Elaine,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
along with a number
of collaborators,

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
used brain imaging while
subjects did a task

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:90%
to uncover depth of processing.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got a lot of research
underway at the moment.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:10%
We've got a couple new fMRI
studies, neuroimaging studies,

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:10%
brain imaging studies
we're conducting.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:10%
>> These findings show that
highly sensitive individuals

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:10%
are not pausing in novel
situations because they're shy

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:10%
or they're scared or they're
putting on the brakes

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.357 align:middle line:10%
to engaging in a situation.

00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what they're
doing is they're

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
engaging systems
of their brain that

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
are associated with awareness,
depth of processing,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
integration of the other
person in the self,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
emotional meaning-making, so
that then they can respond

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.396 align:middle line:90%

00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
tour, immediately the first
few chords would play,

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and I would just feel this
huge relief wash over me.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I could just see
the sweet HSP faces.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.976 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them, a lot of the
HSPs are right up front.

00:25:54.976 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
emotional crying and fervor

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and passion.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.832 align:middle line:84%
And we would just be
married to each other.

00:26:03.832 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I would be a lot of
physical catharsis on stage.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see the effect
of it in the people's faces

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
gratifying in that way.

>> If you think being emotional
means being irrational,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
actually, the latest thinking
is that emotions generally lead

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to better thinking, because
we only think thoroughly about

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.275 align:middle line:90%
something we care about.

00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robert Levenson at
the University of California,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.405 align:middle line:84%
Berkeley, is well known for
his research on emotion.

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things if
you study emotion that

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:10%
you're struck by is just
how different people are

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:10%
in the size of the emotions they
have and the frequency at which

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.100 align:middle line:10%
they become emotional.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that highly
sensitive people report is that

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.950 align:middle line:10%
they cry easily.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Now other people
also cry easily,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to be in general
more true of highly sensitive.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're processing
information more thoroughly,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.096 align:middle line:84%
then the same thing
that might not quite

00:27:13.096 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
make someone else cry because
they're not quite attending

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to it in as much detail is going
to make the highly sensitive

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:90%
person cry.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>> These findings also show that
highly sensitive people show

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:10%
greater activation in areas that
are associated with empathy.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:10%
So in at least 20 or
30 studies of empathy,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:10%
people showed activation
in certain areas

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:10%
that highly sensitive
people are also

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.560 align:middle line:10%
engaging to a greater degree
in response to their partners

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:10%

>> When I walk into a room, I
know what everyone is feeling.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I know if someone
has had a bad day,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I know if someone is
arguing with their wife.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be overwhelming.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:10%
And at a period of time, I
couldn't leave my house at all

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:10%
when I lived in Los Angeles
because I'd walk out my door

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:10%
and feel the feelings
of eight million people.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd run
back into my house.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But I really, really love
that I noticed things

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
that other people don't notice.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It helps me being an antenna for
the world through my writing.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I know what's going on and
what people need to hear,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:90%
and then I can write about it.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So I've turned it sort of
from a curse and a bad trait

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.075 align:middle line:84%
into something that is helpful
to myself and to others.

00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:38.162 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.162 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Empathy means we can
understand what the other

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.780 align:middle line:84%
person is feeling
and be supportive.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
We can also use empathy
to help ourselves,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe to develop our
professional reputation

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
by sensing, for example,
what our clients

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
or students or patients
need, even before they do.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Extensive brain imaging
conducted by Jadzia

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:10%
Jagiellowicz during her
doctoral studies at Stony Brook

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:10%
University and published in
"Social Cognitive and Affective

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:10%
Neuroscience" show that
the areas of the brain

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:10%
for understanding subtle cues
are more active in sensitive

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:10%
than non-sensitive persons.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> What this study means is that
highly sensitive people notice

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:10%
more about the
world they live in.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing is not
just that they notice more,

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
they take what they
notice and they combine it

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
with information that they've
noticed all their life.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So because they've noticed
more all their life,

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and because they're able to
combine all that information,

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
they often come up
with unique new ideas.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Combining ideas in novel ways
is the essence of creativity.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:10%
Even experiences while young,
such as with different animals,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:10%
may lead later to
creative insights

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:10%
about all animals and
their temperaments.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Or, combining novel
ideas might bring

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
about new research
breakthroughs,

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:84%
revolutionary art, or
world-changing insights.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:10%
We are not saying that all
creative people are highly

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:10%
sensitive, but surely the
qualities we see in them do

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:10%
contribute substantially
to creativity.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Another striking
finding was that there

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
was more activity for sensitive
people in the insula, part

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of the brain often called
the seat of consciousness,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because it brings
together all of our inner

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
and outer experiences.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Highly sensitive individuals,
they're engaging the insula

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:10%
to a greater extent because
in some ways it's like

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:10%
they're more aware.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And this is in line with a
lot of the other research

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:10%
and theory on sensory
processing sensitivity,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.030 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that highly
sensitive people are more aware

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:10%
of others.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:84%
They are more aware
of the subtleties

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.855 align:middle line:90%
in their environment.

00:31:01.855 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> These four qualities
we just explored--

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:84%
depth of processing, being
easily overstimulated,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
being more emotionally
responsive,

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and sensing the subtle
in the environment--

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
they add up to highly
sensitive people,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.210 align:middle line:84%
especially in childhood, being
more affected by everything

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that happens to them,
not just bad things,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:90%
but good things too.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And these three
lines of research--

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
mine, Jay Belsky
and Michael Pluess,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and Tom Boyce and
Bruce Ellis, we've

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:84%
all converged on the same idea
of this wonderful trait that's

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:84%
underneath the hood, that
can't be seen easily.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's not been described that
much by the general public.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You can't look at
someone and say, oh,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
that person is sensitive
and that person is not.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now people can
begin to understand

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:84%
a child or a parent or a
friend or a spouse who's

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.220 align:middle line:84%
highly sensitive, but they
didn't understand at first.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Jay Belsky and Michael Pluess
came up with this phrase--

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:90%
differential susceptibility.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Differential susceptibility
is a fairly new concept that

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:10%
refers to individual
differences in how we respond

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:10%
to the environments
that we are exposed to.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Susceptibility is a fancy
word for sensitivity.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:10%
So basically it
refers to the notion

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:10%
that some people are more
sensitive to experiences

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:10%
they meet than other people.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.380 align:middle line:10%
Environmental sensitivity is one
of the most fundamental traits

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:10%
found in humans,
but in many species.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's so fundamental that we
don't even think much about it.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But most of the concepts
we look at that focus

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
on individual differences
contain the notion

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that some people are
more affected by what

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:90%
they experience than others.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Hence, my conclusion
or proposition

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
is that people
differ fundamentally

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in how they perceive and
process environmental features,

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:84%
with some being
generally more and some

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:90%
being generally less sensitive.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Having a higher
degree of sensitivity

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
has advantages and
has disadvantages.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Highly sensitive persons
process all experience more

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:10%
deeply.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:10%
So when we have unsupportive
childhoods that are negative,

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:25.255 align:middle line:10%
when we didn't get the
responses from the parents

00:33:25.255 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:10%
when we were very young, when we
didn't believe they would come

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:10%
when we cried, when our
needs weren't taken care of,

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.530 align:middle line:10%
that simply laid the
foundation for later life--

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:10%
feeling more fearful, being
afraid to venture out and try

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:10%
new things.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:10%
For those individuals
on the other side of it

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:10%
who had supportive childhoods
where the parents provided

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.620 align:middle line:10%
the nurturing,
provided the love,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:10%
provided the attention
that people need,

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:10%
they had a strong
base to build on.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So when they ventured
out into life,

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
they felt more free,
more confident.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they faced
a setback, they

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
were more easily able
to bounce back from it.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So if someone is very
highly sensitive and is exposed

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to very adverse environments,
then that person is more likely

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to develop depression, because
that person is more affected

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:90%
by that particular experience.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:10%
But the positive aspect is that
if they experience support from

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:10%
their environment-- that could
be psychological therapy,

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:10%
that could be social support--

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.020 align:middle line:10%
they are more likely to
benefit from that support.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:10%
>> So now my counsel is,
what you should tell people--

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:10%
pediatricians, counselors,
neonatologists--

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:10%
that some kids have more
difficult temperaments,

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:10%
but they are much more
malleable clay in your hands.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.270 align:middle line:84%
They are going to
thrive and flourish

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.810 align:middle line:84%
if you care for them
well, more so than others.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But they are going
to suffer and go down

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:90%
if you care for them poorly.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So you are much more,
it seems, the conductor

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of this orchestra in those
cases than in other cases.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:90%
But will that get through?

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Will people embrace this?

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.425 align:middle line:90%
Time will tell.

00:35:03.425 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%

deeply, feel things deeply.

and sometimes I won't.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%

had another teacher calling us

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to tell us there's something
wrong with our son.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.160 align:middle line:90%

You've got to stop
overprotecting him, Pam.

00:35:24.254 --> 00:35:26.218 align:middle line:90%
I won't have it.

00:35:26.218 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm not
overprotecting him.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:90%
He's only seven years old.

us to go down there

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and discuss a couple
things with us.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> If Hank is being bullied, he
needs to stand up for himself.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill, she never said anything
about him being bullied.

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then what's
the problem this time?

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.674 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd say that all the adult
highly sensitive people I know,

00:35:49.674 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:10%
most of them will say their
parents didn't understand them

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.065 align:middle line:10%
and that they're spending a
lot of time sorting that out.

00:35:55.065 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%

up when my family was looking

was hosting a show in Canada.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was having a moment, and
I was crying about something

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:84%
intense for me, which
he'd gotten used to,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:90%
I suppose at that point.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, he said,
Alanis, I'm so sorry,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
we just never really
knew what to do with you.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:90%

That I would be good, even

Something about that moment
in his authentic expression

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
of that to me, it
validated a lot

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of my having felt
alone in a world

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
where I felt misperceived
and misunderstood.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there were
a handful of things that,

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:84%
if they were taken into
consideration, that I

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.650 align:middle line:84%
would be my best self
really consistently.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And equally, if I were to
be in environments where

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I was shamed for

it would have been
a lot easier for me

for causes she has found to be

of central importance.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:90%
One is attachment parenting.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Also, because like her, her
son is highly sensitive,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.250 align:middle line:84%
she is deeply interested in
parenting sensitive children.

Alanis told me that she
and her husband, Souleye,

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
know that one key to
parenting their son,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Ever, is, in Alanis's words,
honoring his every feeling

and letting him feel it through.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.640 align:middle line:10%

would be on the ground crying,

freaking out all the time.

00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:10%

out there that would be really

embarrassed by that behavior
where their child is fine one

there's too much
texture, there's just

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard

you're not coming back in this

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%

show a softer side.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.535 align:middle line:84%

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.959 align:middle line:10%
and not reacting with
the anger instead.

00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
frustrated and you can't talk

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.550 align:middle line:90%
about things, you get angry.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.255 align:middle line:90%
That's how I was raised.

00:42:29.255 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>> He needs to get in there
and tackle things-- football,

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.570 align:middle line:90%
basketball.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill, Bill.

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:40.150 align:middle line:90%
This isn't you.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.180 align:middle line:90%
This isn't you.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't you remember
how loving you

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.490 align:middle line:90%
were to him when he was a baby?

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Now he just fears you,
always shouting and hollering

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.772 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:42:55.772 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> For one thing, just think
of the cost of messing up

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:84%
a sensitive child because
they're going to have this

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:84%
depression anxiety and various
problems their whole lives,

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
versus getting it right
and having them being some

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:12.319 align:middle line:84%
of the most productive,
thoughtful members of society.

00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:90%
And what do we need in society?

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:84%
People who think deeply, have
strong emotional response

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So we said, good
heart, a deep mind,

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.010 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to subtleties so
they notice what's going on.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We need more of those
people everywhere.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.220 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories
of successful parenting

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:84%
of a sensitive child is that
of social psychologist Steve

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Wright, a friend and colleague
from Vancouver, Canada,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
a father who is definitely
not highly sensitive himself.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.645 align:middle line:10%
>> My older daughter is not
a highly sensitive person.

00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:10%
And so for two years,
I've been dealing

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.894 align:middle line:10%
with this bubbling
baby who just wanted

00:43:48.894 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:10%
to go out and be everywhere.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.265 align:middle line:84%
And then Reesa showed up and
things were very different.

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I wanted to go there.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Good-bye.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I wondered what
we were doing wrong.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I wondered why she wasn't happy.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I wondered why she
was scared of people,

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:84%
or at least I thought
she was scared of people.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it was
difficult in the sense

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.595 align:middle line:84%
of feeling like that
she was sad too much,

00:44:15.595 --> 00:44:16.970 align:middle line:84%
or that she was
worried too much,

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
or that she wasn't happy about
the things that we were doing,

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.920 align:middle line:84%
or that I was doing
things that were

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:84%
making her feel unsafe or feel
sad or scared or whatever.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was younger, it was
really hard for me to make

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:90%
friends.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:10%
And because I wouldn't
want to be the first person

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.920 align:middle line:10%
to go and talk to someone.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.540 align:middle line:10%
And if the other person
was shy or more reserved,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't go up to them.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:10%
I would wait for people
to come and talk to me.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The big thing for Reesa was
that when we go to new places,

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:90%
she needed time.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> My dad is the
complete opposite to me.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
He's really encouraging
me to do things and always

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But for me, sometimes,
it's too much.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was really
hard on me, too,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.540 align:middle line:84%
because then I felt as if I
was letting them down and I

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:84%
wasn't stepping up, and I wasn't
putting myself out there and I

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:90%
wasn't talking to everybody.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So I felt really bad on myself,
and it was really hard on me.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.042 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a really good
learning lesson for me.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Reesa is not like me, and that
that's perfectly all right.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good way to be.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And here I had been doing
all these things like,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
talk to the man, come on, say
hello, tell him your name.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Or, shake her hand or give
her a hug or whatever.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I realized this is
just totally unfair.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So for both of us, we have
to stop and think about how

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the other person sees things,
and we have to work together,

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:52.020 align:middle line:84%
talk it out, and say, I feel
like this, I know how you feel,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:90%
but this is how I feel.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So we both have to
talk and we both have

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to express our sides
of it for us to be

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:90%
able to get through things.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So some parents learn early
to understand their sensitive

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.630 align:middle line:84%
child and adapt their parenting,
even if with some difficulty.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Others are more
threatened by the idea.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.705 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's up, Mrs. Wilbur?

00:46:12.705 --> 00:46:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Your son seems
a little withdrawn,

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.694 align:middle line:90%
maybe even depressed.

00:46:19.694 --> 00:46:22.135 align:middle line:84%
>> He needs to learn to
stand up for himself.

00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- or
I wondered if he

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.602 align:middle line:84%
was one of those kids
that was born sensitive.

00:46:29.602 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sensitive?

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Great, that's all I need
is to be labeled sensitive.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.246 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like a girl.

00:46:37.246 --> 00:46:40.325 align:middle line:84%
>> There's just as many boys
as there are girls that are

00:46:40.325 --> 00:46:41.125 align:middle line:90%
sensitive.

00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:44.398 align:middle line:90%
>> They call it something else.

00:46:44.398 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's call it, Bill.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Look, I'm going to
say something now.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Bill, I think you're
highly sensitive yourself--

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:90%
emotional, irritable at times.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You're a perfectionist,
always deep in thought.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.045 align:middle line:90%
You want to be your own boss.

00:47:08.045 --> 00:47:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I know it's what
attracted me to you.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know now that you're
just worried that Hank

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.430 align:middle line:90%
is going to be like you.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And you want him to
cover it up, like you

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.052 align:middle line:90%
have been your entire life.

00:47:24.052 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Differential susceptibility
causes some children to be more

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.060 align:middle line:84%
affected than others
by their environment,

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.523 align:middle line:90%
both positively and negatively.

00:47:33.523 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And the same differential
susceptibility

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:90%
occurs in the work environment.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Some work environments bring out
the best in sensitive people,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.860 align:middle line:90%
some definitely don't.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.600 align:middle line:84%
This can cause
some organizations

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.730 align:middle line:90%
to lose their best employees.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And society failed to make
use of one of its greatest

00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:58.850 align:middle line:90%
strengths.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I sort of say that
workplaces are like families.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.226 align:middle line:84%
There are good ones
and not very good ones.

00:48:09.226 --> 00:48:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And sensitive
people are bothered

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.850 align:middle line:84%
more by abusive supervisors
or just negative supervisors

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.980 align:middle line:90%
or negative coworkers.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they end up needing to
quit, and they have to quit.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the one problem
for the highly sensitive

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:33.280 align:middle line:84%
is being easily overstimulated,
especially at work.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.530 align:middle line:84%
One study found that
supervisors were

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.725 align:middle line:84%
most pleased with their
highly sensitive workers.

00:48:38.725 --> 00:48:40.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, I'll be there.

00:48:40.075 --> 00:48:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But these workers themselves
had the lowest well-being.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>> When there are negative
events that are occurring,

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:10%
highly sensitive persons tend to
react in a very overstimulated

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.562 align:middle line:10%
fashion, because we absorb that
negativity much more deeply

00:48:55.562 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:10%
than a non-highly
sensitive person.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Since some corporate cultures
or individual managers may not

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:84%
yet have realized the importance
of supporting their sensitive

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.590 align:middle line:84%
employees' needs, these
employees themselves must do

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.820 align:middle line:84%
what they can to
prevent burnout,

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:84%
which often requires
standing up for themselves,

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
because they usually
are highly valued.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And generally they need
to be careful about taking

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:90%
good care of themselves.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:27.208 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.208 --> 00:49:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But If we don't
practice really a rigorous,

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.290 align:middle line:84%
almost religious
form of self-care,

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:37.310 align:middle line:84%
we really set ourselves up
for a number of health issues,

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:40.880 align:middle line:84%
number of behavioral issues, a
number of emotional issues that

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.595 align:middle line:84%
can affect our entire lives,
our entire sense of well-being.

00:49:43.595 --> 00:49:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The world gets
more high-paced,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
it seems like they
can't keep up.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But they actually
can't keep up, as long

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.570 align:middle line:84%
as they get the few things they
need in the workplace, which

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit
of peace and quiet

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of
positive reinforcement,

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.580 align:middle line:84%
because sensitive
people by nature

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:84%
pick up on criticism so that
they can revise their behavior

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and do better.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But if all they
get is criticism,

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:84%
pretty soon they just
feel beaten down.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:84%
What I have noticed
about sensitive people

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they do switch jobs,
sometimes whole careers.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.285 align:middle line:84%
Very often, they decide
to be self-employed.

00:50:23.285 --> 00:50:25.820 align:middle line:10%
>> For the beginning
of my career,

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.530 align:middle line:10%
I always worked
for other people.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.870 align:middle line:10%
I was in an office
and I couldn't

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.520 align:middle line:10%
stand to be in an office.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.280 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't stand the lighting, I
couldn't stand being cooped up,

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.560 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't stand so many people.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.680 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, I
realized I really

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.560 align:middle line:10%
need to find something
that I can do at home.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and I were
going back and forth, saying,

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.610 align:middle line:84%
you know how can we do
something together as a couple,

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and do something that will
help change the world, which

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.820 align:middle line:90%
was a big thought.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But we really took it to task,
and DailyOM was born of that.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I so much enjoyed
meeting John Hughes.

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
He is such a perfect example
of a sensitive man triumphing

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.710 align:middle line:90%
over adverse conditions.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:10%
In his case, a dominating
father who squelched all

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:21.766 align:middle line:10%
emotion in himself and his son.

00:51:21.766 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:84%
John has spent years
finding his true self.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, he became a
leader in the business world.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.309 align:middle line:10%
>> After a few years--

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:32.350 align:middle line:10%
not even a few years,
probably 20-something years

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:33.150 align:middle line:10%
of my career--

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.940 align:middle line:10%
changing jobs every two to three
years, what I finally realized

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:41.020 align:middle line:10%
is that channeling
that sensitivity

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.380 align:middle line:10%
and that drive to kind
of craft my own career,

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:10%
that's really what I was after.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I get to make a huge impact
in a short period of time.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not locked into one company,
one management or leadership

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.980 align:middle line:90%
style within a company.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I can pick and
choose my clients.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:10%
And there's a freedom,
there's a huge risk

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.690 align:middle line:10%
in being out on my own.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time, there's
a huge freedom as well.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:10%
And the freedom is what
I just absolutely love.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And so I guess what
I've really done

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:16.570 align:middle line:10%
is take my drive and my
desires and my sensitivities

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:21.270 align:middle line:10%
and I've been able to craft
a career that fits me to a T

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.270 align:middle line:10%
>> John Hughes has been such a
successful CIO that he is now

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:10%
in demand as an interim CIO,
while helping companies find

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.110 align:middle line:10%
the right one, as
well as coaching CIOs.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.140 align:middle line:84%
He recently published a highly
praised book on leadership,

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:90%
"Haunting the CEO."

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.750 align:middle line:84%
In an article on why
HSPs make good leaders,

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:43.750 align:middle line:84%
he says they miss nothing,
while falling back

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:90%
to let team members shine.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.200 align:middle line:10%
And they have almost
an innate ability

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:10%
to say and do the right
thing at just the right time.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:10%
His observations about
highly sensitive leaders

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.550 align:middle line:10%
in the corporate environment are
similar to those of Dr. Maike

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:10%
Andresen, a professor
in the renowned business

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:10%
school at Bamberg
University in Germany,

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:04.170 align:middle line:10%
and highly sensitive herself.

>> [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:10%
I did some research about
highly sensitive person

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:10%
regarding the motivation
to become a leader.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:22.720 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to know whether a
highly sensitive person would

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.230 align:middle line:10%
de-select themselves
from this role.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.590 align:middle line:10%
And what I found out so far
is that this is not the case.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.770 align:middle line:10%
So which is good.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:35.222 align:middle line:10%
So it's not that they fear or
are afraid to become a leader,

00:53:35.222 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:10%
and I think there
are some strengths

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.550 align:middle line:10%
that highly sensitive
leaders have.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:44.275 align:middle line:10%
So now the question is how they
can get into these positions.

00:53:44.275 --> 00:53:49.320 align:middle line:90%

an environment
that benefits both.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Such an environment
has been created

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
by the CEO Rupert Mayer of the
leading orchid growing company,

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:84%

with Rupert Mayer,

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I was astonished to see how
sensitive he is and how well he

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:20.620 align:middle line:90%
perceives his employees.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:84%
He has a very detailed view
about their personality.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was amazed.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.675 align:middle line:90%
I never saw that among managers.

00:54:26.675 --> 00:54:29.140 align:middle line:84%

these days to have a technical

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.570 align:middle line:10%
competence, a social competence,
and sensitivity towards

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:05.250 align:middle line:10%
colleagues who are considered
to be highly sensitive.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.480 align:middle line:10%

concept of high sensitivity,

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I think there is one danger.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And the danger is
that people think

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that we want to do
something for a minority,

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and that they need special care
and special treatment, which

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:24.850 align:middle line:90%
is not the case.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it is just a trait,
and some 20% have this trait,

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and the 80% do not
have this trait.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.310 align:middle line:10%
And for me, it's more
a question of profiting

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:40.610 align:middle line:10%
from the strengths of both
groups and to combine people,

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:45.770 align:middle line:10%
and so that we can profit
from each other's personality

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:10%
traits.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.265 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.265 --> 00:55:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly, the needs of
the highly sensitive require

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:56.290 align:middle line:84%
attention if they're going
to stay in companies.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But both research
and the experience

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:84%
of some business
people teaches us

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that organizations
need both types.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:07.930 align:middle line:84%
How can we all work together--
parenting, in organizations,

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:09.580 align:middle line:90%
or in marriage?

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.510 align:middle line:84%
First, the highly sensitive must
value themselves so that they

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:17.020 align:middle line:84%
can balance the other
80% and do their part,

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:90%
their own particular part.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to know
is, what you teach

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.730 align:middle line:90%
HSPs is about being empowered.

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:34.835 align:middle line:10%
What do they need to know?

00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh great, that's
such a great question.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.160 align:middle line:10%
It's come to me over the years
sort of this metaphor of,

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.610 align:middle line:10%
here we are in San
Francisco and California

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.320 align:middle line:10%
and it's Highway 101--

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.700 align:middle line:10%
I call it Highway 101.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like the dominant
culture-- there's six lanes,

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.336 align:middle line:84%
everybody is going
fast, everybody

00:56:50.336 --> 00:56:51.860 align:middle line:90%
is got a destination to get to.

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
prove themselves.

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that doesn't
work for we HSPs.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So I teach them that,
somewhere along this journey,

00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.840 align:middle line:90%
there's an exit.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's our own unique exit.

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Like mine is Jacquelyn
103.25, yours is Elaine Aron.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:07.080 align:middle line:90%
We've got our own exit.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's a spiritual journey.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the idea of it
being a spiritual journey,

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:15.470 align:middle line:84%
because understanding
sensitivity takes all of us

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:20.210 align:middle line:84%
deeper into our actual true
self, whatever that is.

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But we have also
seen that this is

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:27.266 align:middle line:84%
a scientific journey, and a
journey for human culture.

00:57:27.266 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the beautiful thing about
high sensitivity is that there

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:37.280 align:middle line:10%
are a great deal of scientific
studies that support

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.840 align:middle line:10%
the construct and how it relates
to other aspects of psychology.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And this is really
wonderful because if people

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.690 align:middle line:10%
become engaged in
it and they allow

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:52.250 align:middle line:10%
the ideas to enter
their lives, then

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:54.470 align:middle line:10%
they'll be doing
something really important

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:58.400 align:middle line:10%
for themselves, because they'll
be getting scientific evidence

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.911 align:middle line:10%
that has value.

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:08.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We now know that during these
early critical periods of great

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.790 align:middle line:10%
susceptibility to environmental
influence that children are

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:18.170 align:middle line:10%
enormously affected and set
on developmental trajectories

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.780 align:middle line:10%
by their early experiences.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of
support and care,

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.410 align:middle line:84%
predictability, routines,
all of the things

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that we think of as
giving appearance to life,

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the more children
experience that, the better

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.080 align:middle line:84%
families become, the
better communities become.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.655 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the long-run,
the better societies become.

00:58:39.655 --> 00:58:43.410 align:middle line:10%
>> I have always, always
listened to my daughter--

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.210 align:middle line:10%
always.

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Everything she felt,
everything she had to say

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.780 align:middle line:10%
was important to me.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.930 align:middle line:10%
I would always get down
to her, I would always

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:53.600 align:middle line:10%

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like
my sensitivity, I

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.900 align:middle line:10%
view it more as a super
power than something that

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:10%
is defect about me,
because it makes

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.120 align:middle line:10%
me able to connect to people.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So I found that knowing that
other people were like this,

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.130 align:middle line:10%
it removed a lot
of stress for me,

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:22.960 align:middle line:10%
because then I was not
constantly thinking that, oh,

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm not right, this isn't
how I'm supposed to be.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It made me realize that it's
OK for me to be like this

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:30.440 align:middle line:84%

how I am as well.

for the sensitivities
that I have.

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.230 align:middle line:10%
Because I know,
at the same time,

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:44.000 align:middle line:10%
those sensitivities have
really carved some things in me

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.340 align:middle line:10%
that I just think are
just absolutely awesome.

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.060 align:middle line:10%
And if I were to
point to just one,

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.700 align:middle line:10%
it's the leadership aspect.

sensitive people in our culture

are the oracles who see

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.100 align:middle line:10%
into the future and see
what's coming in our culture.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.760 align:middle line:10%
And we don't give them enough
credit as guides to us,

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.240 align:middle line:10%
but instead demean them because
they're different than we are.

mercy and respect,

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.160 align:middle line:84%
just respect for how
much we as a trait,

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.225 align:middle line:84%
as a community of sensitives,
how much we contribute.

>> Sensitivity clearly benefits
the 20% and the 80% alike.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the actuality
of differential susceptibility,

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
which means a sensitive gain
more from a good environment

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and are most affected
by a poor one.

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they are most noticed
by the other 80% when they

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.750 align:middle line:90%
are being overly sensitive.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Those with happier
histories adapt and make

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.190 align:middle line:90%
their valued contributions.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And only those close to
them know they're different

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and that they grew up
feeling a little flawed.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever their backgrounds,
however, the highly sensitive

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.850 align:middle line:84%
see the subtle signs of what's
coming and think about it

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.090 align:middle line:90%
deeply, more than others do.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Our world is going
through vast changes,

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
some of them frightening,
and many of them

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.650 align:middle line:90%
not clearly understood.

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
We all need these
sensitive minds and hearts,

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
people like those
you've met here,

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to study and reflect on
our world as it is now.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We really need them.

And to the highly sensitive,
I say, I beg you, speak out.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
You now know you
are in good company.
