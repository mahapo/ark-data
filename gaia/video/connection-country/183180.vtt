00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on around
here since the early days.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
My people were used as slaves
on the pearling boats, forced

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
to dive for pearls for no pay.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
If the boat was sold, they were
included as part of the price.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they tried to fight
back, they'd be slaughtered.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
These standing stones
here at the Burrup

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
represent the people,
including women and children,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
who died in the
Flying Foam Massacre.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.178 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.178 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Our people came
around afterwards

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and stood up these stones
to remember them by.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The government created policies
to deny Aboriginal people

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:90%
existence.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
The assimilation
policy was designed

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to breed Aboriginal people out.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Those that have been
assimilated into earning good

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:10%
living or earning wages
amongst the civilized areas,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:10%
that have been
accepted into society,

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:10%
and they have accepted society
and can handle society,

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:10%
I'd leave them well alone.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.575 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are no good to
themselves, who can't accept

00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:90%
things, they're half caste.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.533 align:middle line:84%
And this is where most
of the troubles come.

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I would get the water up so
that they were sterile and would

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
breed themselves
out in the future,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.465 align:middle line:84%
and that would
solve the problem.

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Hancock was the person who
started the iron ore mining

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
in the 1960s.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder the
railway line sometimes

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:90%
went through sacred sites.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, they built
these massive gas plants.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
We negotiated an agreement
to build the plant away

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
from our sacred sites,
but the resource companies

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
went ahead anyway.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a fertilizer plant,
with emissions so acidic

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
they can corrode the rocks.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Do they really want to
destroy what's been here

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:90%
for over 40,000 years?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder there's
a sense of urgency

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
right across the Pilbara,
right across the state,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
because there's a fear from
our old people, our elders,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that our heritage
isn't being respected.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
In 2014, the government began
trying to make amendments

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to the Aboriginal Heritage
Act so they could fast

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
track approvals for mining
and resource companies

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.085 align:middle line:90%
to destroy sites.

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Gregg McIntyre has been
fighting for Aboriginal rights

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
He was the barrister who
with the Aboriginal people

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:90%
first won land rights.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Even if the Aboriginal
Cultural Materials Committee,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:10%
under the Aboriginal
Heritage Act,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:10%
identifies a site as of
extreme significance,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:10%
there's still a power by
the minister of the day

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:10%
of the state government to
consent to the destruction

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:10%
of the site.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The very important
Burrup Peninsula

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
was removed from the
Register of Aboriginal Sites

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.967 align:middle line:90%
as a site as a whole.

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I understand that there are
some parts of it which still

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:90%
remain as archeological sites.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But as a heritage unit,
that peninsula was removed.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> This rock art is our
stories, our commission.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's an important
part of our heritage.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's constantly
under threat.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:10%
>> What we've seen here in the
Pilbara is lots of sites that

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.667 align:middle line:10%
we thought were sites.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:10%
The bureaucrats in the DIA
have gone through them,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:10%
and they've chucked
them out essentially.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
they're not sites.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:90%
That don't meet the criteria.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And the strategy
here, from my point

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
of view, what I
see is this, it's

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
all about whittling
down heritage values,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
cultural heritage
values on the land,

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:84%
getting them out
of the way, which

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
means that developers
and explorers and miners

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
have an easier path to get
their approvals in place.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Rock art is just one
part of our heritage.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
We have sacred sites, quarries,
fertility and burial sites.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So why does the government
keep amending our Aboriginal

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Heritage Act?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The Aboriginal Heritage
Act is really about Aboriginal

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
heritage being the
heritage of the state.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all objects are
said to belong to the state

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
if they're identified
as Aboriginal objects

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
under the legislation.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And decisions are
said to be made

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in the interests of the
Western Australian community

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.299 align:middle line:84%
rather than in the interests
of Aboriginal people.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The British government denied
that there were people here,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:90%
that there was a culture here.

Now the way the native

it makes us feel that
we're being denied again

I assure you, I
share your concerns.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:10%
And I know, looking at this
petition that we've been given,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people worried
about this proposed change.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It's my view that
the change doesn't

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:84%
give due respect
and consultation

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:90%
for Aboriginal people.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And the points that I've made
is that Aboriginal heritage

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
isn't something for
government to bequeath

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.720 align:middle line:90%
to Aboriginal people.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.955 align:middle line:84%
It's been there well before
government came along here

00:39:15.955 --> 00:39:16.830 align:middle line:90%
in Western Australia.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look
after and respect.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And importantly,
Aboriginal people

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
need to be involved in the
process around heritage

being silly buggers

that's not who they really are.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:31.590 align:middle line:84%
That's not who their parents
are and their grandparents are.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:90%

That's what it is.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They let the air out from
the sewage, a sewage vent.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Just so all the bad smell
from all the [NON-ENGLISH]

probably roughly maybe just
