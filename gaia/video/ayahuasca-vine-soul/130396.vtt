was extremely, extremely

through a lot of different
emotions and thoughts

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:84%
about it, some of which
were sort of anxiety.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Am I bit too tired to be
doing this at the moment?

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%

I have since I arrived,

really pretty peaceful.

to sort of work on

was it's difficult for me to
see as yet how I can integrate

this on a professional level.

can you help me to understand?

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%

today and the use of other

and a ceremonial

a therapeutic or
spiritual experience.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%

And we do learn about

But it's much more
dominated by the science.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always reached
out to have opportunities

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to integrate both.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:90%

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>At a ceremony 15
years ago, Francois

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.062 align:middle line:84%
used ayahuasca to help kick
an addiction to heroin.

00:20:02.062 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Addiction comes from a
sense of deficient emptiness.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And trying to complete
yourself from the outside

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:10%
is the essence of addiction.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:84%
With ayahuasca, one
has an opportunity

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to experience oneself
as whole and complete.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
If you can actually get that
you're whole and complete,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
what is there to be filled
from the outside anymore?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
There's just no need for it.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca can help people
see that in two or three

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies if it's the
appropriate shamanic leader

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and if it's the
right environment.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is a potential
to heal addictions.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Ayahuasca is used
for many reasons.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:84%
For a curandero
like Dave, ayahuasca

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
is a teacher of the
healing powers of plants.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.237 align:middle line:84%
>>My home-- please
take off your shoes

00:21:32.237 --> 00:21:33.695 align:middle line:84%
before you come in
my home, please.

00:21:33.695 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is in many ways like
the key to the door that allows

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%
you into plant teacher world.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca allows you to access
the other plant teachers

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.236 align:middle line:90%
in a more profound way.

00:21:46.236 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
A plant teacher is--
I mean, the best

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
way to look at it is you
look at a plant as a being,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and you would-- as a friend.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Each plant has a personality
as each human does.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.615 align:middle line:84%
You take on the traits
of a plant, you know?

00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And plants are very
sensitive and very intuitive.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And in healing, you need to
be very sensitive and very

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
intuitive.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So we take these plants to
learn from them and in a way,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to become them.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I came here with the intention
of gaining more strength

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
in my work.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm on a diet now with
a bunch of different plants

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.632 align:middle line:84%
and trees to give me more
strength and more protection.

00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:90%
You smell so beautiful.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a mix of 25, 30 different
that I drink every day.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It really breaks down the body
at the beginning to open up.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Your body feels a little bit
out of balance and a little bit

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:90%
weak.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But the most important thing
is I feel good in my mind.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.905 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:22:55.905 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>After a day of
reflection, Rob and Kirsty

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
return for their
second ceremony.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Again, I was just wanting to
experience so much so quickly.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It was probably overestimating
my level what ayahuasca

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
wanted to show me at that time.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I kind of
wanted to take more.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:90%
But in a way, I didn't.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.700 align:middle line:90%
You have to respect ayahuasca.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:90%
She was telling me something.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>It's totally different
from the night prior.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I was restless and
sort of agitated.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
A part of ayahuasca
is the purging aspect.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I sort of had always just
thought that meant vomiting.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But it just can be a lot of
different bodily things going

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:90%
on, and noises, and belching.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And it was unbelievable.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I cagey, kind of.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to leave the
room entirely, actually,

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But I sort of got
stuck standing there.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It was just frustrating kind of.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
When I did go
outside, I found Rob.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:34.404 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.404 --> 00:24:35.892 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh my god.

00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:36.884 align:middle line:90%
>>We saw the sky.

00:24:36.884 --> 00:24:40.356 align:middle line:90%
And it was just staggering.

00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:43.828 align:middle line:84%
It was just astonishing
how beautiful it was.

00:24:43.828 --> 00:24:48.292 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a huge shooting
star, which blew my mind.

00:24:48.292 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.256 align:middle line:90%
>>And then we left.

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back to my
cabin, I kind of laid down.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And I closed my eyes.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And like a lot of times
when you close your eyes,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:90%
you see some light imagery.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it began
to swirl together.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And it created this
little eddy right

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:90%
in front of my field of vision.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And then bit by
bit, little images

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
would appear out of
this eddy-- come out,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and go back in, come
out, and go back in.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was ready to write
off the evening as somewhat

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.284 align:middle line:84%
of a rejection or
a negative, she

00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
pulled me right back and
then put me to sleep.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.207 align:middle line:90%
>>It's really a therapy.

00:25:35.207 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You have one ceremony,
it's like going

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:90%
to psychotherapy for two years.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Colin from Vancouver attended
ayahuasca ceremonies for a year

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.672 align:middle line:90%
before coming to Peru.

00:25:46.672 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
He's hoping to heal
a troubled marriage.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>For me, I just want to be the
father that I know I can be,

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and the husband I can
be, and support my wife.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Because family
comes first, right?

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>We had been on and off
and are continuing in kind

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of a power struggle stage.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We have done couples
therapy counseling,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't quite-- I mean,
it works for a little bit.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:90%
But there's a deeper issue.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>When I came here, I knew I
wanted to go a little deeper.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
For me, the one word that
came up with acceptance.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Acceptance of myself,
acceptance of my past,

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance of my wife was
probably the number one thing.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
To her, that was the big
blockage in our relationship.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>There is something that's
obviously keeping us together.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
kind of something

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:90%
we keep coming up against.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>I realized that I've had
this sense of sadness within me

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
affecting multiple things from
past relationships, people that

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:84%
have passed in my life,
to sadness around things

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
around my childhood, and been
unhappy with my sort of place

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sad about it at times.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>After each ceremony, Guillermo
encourages participants to talk

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:90%
about their experiences.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>I feel myself attached with
a bit of a dark spirit, which

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:90%
came to me last night.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's all linked to an
ex-girlfriend who has died.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:90%
She's since died.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.332 align:middle line:84%
But she's still-- there
was lots of love there.

00:27:15.332 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of lightness.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But her dark side is sort
of still hanging on to me.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:90%
She's a very manipulative woman.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost the
first woman in my life.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.613 align:middle line:90%
>>It's very clear.

00:27:53.613 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Gracias.

And I had some nightmares, a lot
of sweating during the night,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:84%
almost like my body is
trying to move it through.

work as a naturopathic doctor,

I sort of feel confused.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
To employ this medicine
even in a limited capacity

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:16.048 align:middle line:84%
probably takes a lot of personal
journeying-- period-- for me.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I need to talk it through
with Dave, how he operates.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Because the ceremony is crucial.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%

These are all the plans
we use for bathing here.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They bring love, attract
love and good luck.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh yeah.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.185 align:middle line:84%
>>And all these
medicines up here

00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:84%
are all for men to get
a little extra energy.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a testosterone--

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>It means seven times.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Seven times.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Seven times per night.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:90%

>>The other thing
that Dave says was

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that ayahuasca is
going to meet you

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
where you're at in terms of what
needs to happen and potentially

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to go very deep into your
own fears, and challenges,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and personal growth.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I think next time,
I'm ready to go.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's challenging,
I'm ready to sort of

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:84%
have a bit more, and go deeper,
and just face what I find.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>What Kirsty and Rob will face
on this, their third ceremony,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
is unknown and unknowable.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The mysterium
tremendum is, as you

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:84%
can tell from the term,
a tremendous mystery.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It is at the core of
all true religious

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:84%
or mystical experience,
the feeling of being

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:90%
at one with the universe.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's the experience
that most religions

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:90%
are frantic to deny.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not for the
ordinary person.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, the interpretation
has to come through the church,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
through the priesthood, through
the hierarchy, or whatever.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'll tell you
what this means.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the interesting things

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:90%
about ayahuasca.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a tool
to actually approach

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:90%
this phenomenon experimentally.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:10%
And some people
wait all their lives

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:10%
and spend years in
meditation and all sorts

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:10%
of ascetic experiences and never
have a mystical experience.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:84%
You can be just a kind
of an ordinary schmuck.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And under the right
circumstances,

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.943 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics can trigger
this kind of experience.

00:31:57.943 --> 00:32:03.042 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:06.214 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm just experiencing
everything possible that's

00:32:06.214 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:90%
in life, I think, in a moment.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
taking them all in

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.235 align:middle line:84%
without trying to
state how you feel.

00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:15.225 align:middle line:90%
Just let it be.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And listen to
everything come in.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.272 align:middle line:90%
And it awes you into silence.

00:32:23.272 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Last night was just
the culmination

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of finally being at home
down here, good medicine,

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and just listening to
Guillermo and everyone chant.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It was everything that it
could possibly be, I think.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.815 align:middle line:90%
It was just perfect.

00:32:36.815 --> 00:32:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.000 align:middle line:84%
As my strongest visions
at the very beginning

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
were like a
multi-level dimension.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a door
being opened to this.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's constantly
being opened.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly being opened.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And it never goes away,
because it's new again.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's nature
just showing you.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:84%
At times I feel like she
could actually control my head

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and tilt it different
ways and look around.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:11.196 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
look at Guillermo.

00:33:11.196 --> 00:33:16.812 align:middle line:84%
And it's just--
I don't know how.

00:33:16.812 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:90%
But it was so nice.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was maternal even
when looking at Guillermo.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I wasn't a younger
person than Guillermo.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I was older looking at
him like he was a child.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you were so
proud of this child.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at what he's doing.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
She was saying that as
she looked at Guillermo.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Look at all he can do.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a sense of
awe and renewed innocence

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
But that was partly from her.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
spiritual thing

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I've ever felt in my whole life.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could tell Kirsty
wasn't quite having

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:90%
as great a time as I was.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.005 align:middle line:84%
>>The ceremony last night
was exceptionally hard.

00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't get a nice,
peaceful vision or experience.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:24.440 align:middle line:84%
There were just moments where
I just couldn't even bear it.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, it was just
unbelievably hard.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I felt a lot of dark things.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.897 align:middle line:90%
And this sounds very dramatic.

00:34:35.897 --> 00:34:38.630 align:middle line:90%
But it was pretty demonic.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, there were some pretty
terrifying moments where

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going to die.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
going to shut down

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.330 align:middle line:90%
as a self-protection mechanism.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:84%
Because it was I was way,
way beyond dealing with it.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.487 align:middle line:84%
And it literally was like a
miracle, because Dave appeared.

>>What happens in a strong
experience with ayahuasca

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
like that is that
you lose control.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:90%
An ego is about having control.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.905 align:middle line:90%
You can't control ayahuasca.

00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:90%
You can work with it.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to control it
and get into a power struggle

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:84%
with ayahuasca,
that's where she's

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:84%
going to come on stronger to
try to have that egoic death

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual death.

sort of components to it

to do with my family.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:84%
People would come to me,
different people in my life

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
whom I love, would come to me
and try to communicate to me,

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and then would be sucked away.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to
communicate with them.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
be sucked away.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It was truly, truly
indescribable, the horror.

>>I was so terrified
of losing him,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:24.020 align:middle line:84%
because he was like a
lifeline, that I was like,

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I will drag myself.

I don't care what it takes.

And he helped me get over there.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he just--
he did chanting.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:90%

So I'm there to throw
her a line in a way.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Because she was getting
drowned in her experience.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm there to find
her path and find

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:90%
the way that she got there.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:84%

chanting, find her,

and then bring her back
in her body and back

with her connection.

alone, like just piss off.

00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:22.682 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to deal with that.

Go to Guillermo.

And I was like, can I crawl?

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.711 align:middle line:90%
So I dragged myself.
