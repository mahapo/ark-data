[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the moment

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that you lose touch with the
earth-- you know, the moment

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:84%
that your feet lift
off the ground,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:84%
there's just this instant
feeling of joy and surprise.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
That feeling of vertigo--
it's not the fear of falling.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the fear of
your deep desire

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
to want to throw
yourself into the freedom

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.505 align:middle line:90%
of the feeling of falling.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't like standing on a
cliff if I'm not anchored in.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.271 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I'm anchored in
and I understand the system,

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm free.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
When you take gravity and
you just play with it,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.695 align:middle line:84%
and you find ways to soften
it-- to dance on walls--

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.726 align:middle line:90%
to dance on cliff faces.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're dancing on a cliff
and a peregrine falcon flies by

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and eyes you, you're
transported into a place where

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
you no longer feel the
ache of your harness

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.585 align:middle line:84%
and you've become the
jump that you're doing.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:02:04.155 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go and sort of
dive off the cliff of fear.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And once that happened, I
was able to find the dance.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.472 align:middle line:84%
I love to climb
mountains-- ice climb.

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty wild, I
guess, for a blind person.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being a blind mountain
climber is sort of like being

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.895 align:middle line:90%
a Jamaican bobsledder.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, the words don't
necessarily go together.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm scanning my
tools up the ice.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to use
the end of my tools

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
as though they are
extensions of my hands.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm actually feeling through
the metal picks of my tools.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I find something
I think is a good hit,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll just tap it.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'll listen to the sound.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.525 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a good
sound, then I'll swing.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I think, um, sometimes
that fear of reaching out

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
into the unknown
paralyzes people

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they just
decide not to reach out at all.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And for me, all the great
things that have ever come to me

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
have come through reaching
out into that unknown.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And-- and, uh-- and
I think life is just

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
sort of an ongoing
process of reaching out

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.877 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness when
you-- you really don't

00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
know what you're going to find.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can't
really have fear.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Basically, fear
causes hesitation.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Hesitation will make your
worst fears come true.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.191 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself getting to a
point where you just, sort of,

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:90%
let go.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And it almost feels
easy and real natural.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It always seems like
I'm sort of precariously

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:90%
balanced between fear and hope.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:10%
You have to kind of walk
right in the middle.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.966 align:middle line:90%
