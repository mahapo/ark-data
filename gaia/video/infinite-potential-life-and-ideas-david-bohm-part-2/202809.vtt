Bohm traveled to Israel,

where he accepted a position

to Brazil after the House

Un-American Activities business.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.070 align:middle line:10%
And he was never happy there.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:10%
There were many
problems, he felt.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
And then he was offered
an opportunity in Israel.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was a
new state at the time.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And also, of course,
he was Jewish.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he saw this as
a good opportunity.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And he'd only been
there a couple of weeks

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:90%
when he was invited to a party.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And Saral was present.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And she spotted him
from across the room

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and immediately was
interested in this young man.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I would describe Saral as
a very motherly person.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to look after people.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
She liked to feed people.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.767 align:middle line:84%
She was very sociable
and including everyone.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:10%
>> My wife and I used to
go to the public library.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.612 align:middle line:10%
And she discovered a
book by Krishnamurti.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And she read in there
the words of the observer

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and the observed.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had been interested
in that because, in quantum

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, that is a key
question, in the sense that,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
because of this
undivided wholeness,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
the two cannot be separated.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:10%
>> And she opened the book,
and in it immediately saw

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:10%
references to things with
regard to the observer

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:10%
and the observed.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And she was startled
because that's what David

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:90%
was working with in physics.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And Saral is trying to
understand how could this

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
be that this Indian
philosopher is also

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.795 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
observer and the observed.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> From Israel, Bohm
moved to Bristol.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was here that
his fundamental ideas

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
on the nature of reality
began to take fresh impetus.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:10%
In Bristol, Bohm left his
hidden variable ideas behind,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:10%
and was now focusing on the fact
that, despite decades of work,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:10%
physicists had been unable
to reconcile quantum theory

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:10%
with Einstein's relativity.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:10%


00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:10%
>> He's left behind
his hidden variables.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:10%
He's left that
behind, and now he's

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:10%
asking, why has there
been decades of work

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:10%
on relativity and
quantum theory,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:10%
the two key theories of
physics, why are there two?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Why is it not just one theory,
one unified theory, as Einstein

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:10%
had hoped there would be?

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he's wondering,
do we need a new theory?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that the core issue?

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Or is a completely new order
to physics, a new approach?

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was what he
began to think about, what

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:90%
he called the implicate order.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:90%
We need a radically new order.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was where his thinking
was when he arrived in Britain.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> At this time, Bohm also
developed a new interest that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
was to have a deep impact
on his life and his approach

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:90%
to science.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
quantum physics has long

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
been concerned with the process
of wave function observation.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And Bohm was very much
aware that, depending

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
on the conditions
of an experiment,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that electrons would behave
differently depending

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.842 align:middle line:90%
on what was being observed.

00:04:08.842 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was younger, I
felt that, in the beginning,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that science would surely be a
source of benefiting mankind.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And I had no question about it.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I began to feel that
something beyond science

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.875 align:middle line:84%
would be needed to
approach this question,

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
you see, that science
alone could not

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
guarantee that it would be
used for benefiting mankind,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:90%
the scientific impulse.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, I thought
it would, just truth alone.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:10%
Then I began to look into
philosophy, Eastern and Western

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:10%
and so on, and some people
with religious ideas.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just simply looking
at it when I was in Bristol,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
in England.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In quantum physics, in
the study of the behavior

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of the electron, you had this
very mysterious property that

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
your act of observing the
electron changes it in such

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
a way that there's a link
between the apparatus

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of observation and
what is observed.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And Krishnamurti made a
similar statement about events

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in the psychological
field, which

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the act of
observing something

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
inwardly, some emotion or
some attitude or whatever,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
the very seeing
of it changes it,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
so that the inward sense of an
observer, myself, who's looking

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
is inextricably connected
with whatever I'm looking at.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And so Krishnamurti
expressed that

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
in sort of an
aphoristic fashion,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
by saying the observer
is the observed.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Which, in essence, took
the questions that David was

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
working with in physics and
flipped them into the human

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:90%
realm--

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
the realm of human experience,
human life, human difficulties.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
David felt that Krishnamurti
was on to something

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of great importance
that could help

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
to complete the
sense of wholeness

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that he was trying to bring to
light with his work in physics.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Krishnamurti's approach
aligned with Bohm's own views

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:10%
on the nature of
thought, of reality,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:10%
and on the nature of
consciousness, in particular,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:10%
seen as a coherent whole which
is never static or complete,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:10%
but a continuous process
of enfolding and unfolding.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Both Bohm and
Krishnamurti questioned

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
their respective backgrounds,
ultimately rejecting

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
the orthodoxy they had once
felt would provide answers

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:90%
to humanity's big questions.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In his early life, he
was kind of adopted by this

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
organization called the
Theosophical Society,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
which discovered him when he was
a 14-year-old boy on the beach

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
in South India.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And they predicted
that he was going

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to become this great what
they called world teacher,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and bring a new kind of
consciousness to mankind.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And they cultivated him and
nourished him in this role.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere about the age
of 25, 27, maybe a little

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
bit earlier than that, he
began to seriously question

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
all of this, and find
it very limiting,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
similarly to the way Bohm had
found the scientific orthodoxy

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.082 align:middle line:90%
to be limiting.

00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So Bohm wanted
to meet this man.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And they had this meeting,
and I'm told partway

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:84%
through it Krishnamurti was
supposed to have stood up

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
with pleasure or
enthusiasm or whatever,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and said you have seen it,
sir, so that Bohm had seen it.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And then Bohm began to have
more meetings with Krishnamurti.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
He became a trustee of
Krishnamurti's school

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:90%
at Brockwood Park.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It was at Brockwood Park that
Bohm and Krishnamurti entered

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:84%
into a series of conversations
whose themes covered the ending

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of time, the nature
of mind, cosmic order,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.535 align:middle line:84%
and much more over
a 25-year period.

00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And from Krishnamurti's
perspective,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
it was very important for him
because he felt as though he

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
had a tremendous reservoir
of insights to share with

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
the world, but he felt like he
couldn't necessarily bring it

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.533 align:middle line:90%
out by himself.

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:90%
He needed people to ask him.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
He needed people to dig
and to question him.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:10%
And of all the people he ever
met, Bohm was the best at that.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think Bohm,
to some extent,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
formed a similar function
for Krishnamurti,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
because Krishnamurti could raise
questions with him that might

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
not occur in another context.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Grief is not my grief.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Grief is human.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, now but how are
to people to see that?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Because a person
feeling grief feels

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's his grief, you--

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I mean,
doesn't that seem right?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it is because
partly of our education,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:90%
partly our society, tradition.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's also implicit in
our whole way of thinking.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Quite right.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.056 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:14.925 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to
jump out of that.

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:15.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> But perhaps we can see
that love is not personal.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Love does not belong
to anybody, any more

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:90%
than any other quality does.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Earth is not English
Earth or French Earth.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Earth is Earth.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> You see?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking of
an example in physics

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that, if a scientist
or chemist is studying

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
an element such as sodium, it's
not that he studies his sodium,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else
studies his sodium,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.642 align:middle line:90%
and they somehow compare notes.

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite, quite, quite.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Sodium is sodium.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sodium is sodium universally.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we have to say love
is love universally, right?

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the point
made by Krishnamurti

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
was that the problems
of mankind originate

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
in thought itself, in
consciousness itself, you see?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And as previous to
that, I had grown up

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
believing that poverty was
the main problem of mankind,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and science would help
me eliminate that.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that no
matter how far science went,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.525 align:middle line:90%
it probably wouldn't.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And even if it did,
it wouldn't really

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
solve-- it wouldn't
really make mankind happy.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember I once
asked Bohm, I said, well,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
what do you think, what's
the main contribution

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:90%
of Krishnamurti?

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And if I remember
it correctly, Bohm

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
said something like that
Krishnamurti kind of pointed

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
out that thought is an
actual movement in our lives.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical movement,
physiological movement.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And it has a tremendous power.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:10%
It's behind almost
all our problems.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to give attention
to that manner in which thought

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is participating and shaping
what we observe in order

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand how our
whole mind is working,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
especially with respect to
conflicts which occur between

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you and me, between my
country and another country,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and also the conflicts
which occur inwardly.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And there, then, of course,
Krishnamurti was suggesting

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:10%
that, if you are
able to be quiet,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:10%
the deeper layers of reality
might open up for you.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that state of mind,
the mind is not just blank.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
doing anything.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It's very active.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The thinking
process doesn't have

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to do with thought or
recognition or knowledge,

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's in a state of
just perception, awareness,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could even say
receptivity to truth.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There might have been
many reasons Bohm was drawn

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:90%
to Krishnamurti.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:10%
The ones that are
apparent to me,

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:10%
Bohm perceived the
wholeness of life.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
He perceived life as
one indivisible whole,

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
including nature,
including consciousness.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:10%
And in Krishnamurti,
he found someone

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:10%
who also had this notion.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Krishnamurti, who
was actually addressing

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:10%
the separation of the observer
and the observed in the same

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:10%
way as the wholeness in
quantum theory was saying,

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:10%
you can't make a separation
between the system that

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at
and the apparatus,

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:10%
which was the old
traditional way of doing it,

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:10%
that somehow these
things formed a whole.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But rather than saying
you can't develop concepts

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
for it, what David was trying
to do was to develop concepts.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, to develop
those concepts you

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
can't develop within
the scientific context.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go outside
to a wider set of concepts.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And he found in
Krishnamurti a way

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.265 align:middle line:84%
of discussing this
more general question.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:10%
>> I remember one day
we were here in Italy,

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:10%
and he said to me, do you think
I should give up doing physics

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.806 align:middle line:10%
and just devote myself
to Krishnamurti?

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And my reply was
kind of, fish exist

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:10%
outside the goldfish bowl.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:10%
But that was it.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:10%
He was that extreme,
that maybe he

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:10%
should devote himself
completely to having

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.027 align:middle line:10%
his own brain transformed.

00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Having settled
permanently in the UK,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:84%
it was while at Birkbeck College
in London that Bohm formed one

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:84%
of the most enduring science
partnerships of his life with

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:90%
physicist Basil Hiley.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And he also had an unexpected
and welcome encounter

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:10%
with a forgotten theory.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.256 align:middle line:10%
And that encounter
changed everything.

00:13:46.256 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>> At that time, David Bohm was
developing a new idea which was

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:10%
called structured process, that
basically we want to start with

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:10%
process.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Not particles
moving in spacetime,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but a process from which
both particles and spacetime

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:90%
can emerge.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Very radical ideas.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Chris Dewdney and Chris
Phillipidis came up to me

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:10%
and said, why don't you
talk about the '52 paper?

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.645 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
said, mm, uh, mm,

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:90%
uh, because I think it's wrong.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Chris
said to me, Basil,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:90%
have you read the paper?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I then had to
agree that I hadn't.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It had been decades since
the physics orthodoxy had

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
blackballed Bohm and
his hidden variables.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It would take a new
team of mavericks

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to unearth this critical
work and resurrect it

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:90%
for a new generation.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I got to know David
Bohm quite well when I was

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:90%
a lecturer at Birkbeck College.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
We had many very
interesting discussions,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and Bohm was somebody
who I got a lot from.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:10%
I always thought that he was
very much like a wave function

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:10%
himself, that you'd
ask a question,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:10%
you see, a very
specific question.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And he would be very focused and
give you a deep, very focused

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:90%
answer to that question.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
start to spread out,

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and it would encompass a
little more about physics,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it spread, and
then about philology,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.185 align:middle line:84%
and about human
nature, and so on.

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd get a bit lost
about what's going on,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
so I'd need another question.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask him another
question, and then woomph.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The conversation would
focus itself very deeply

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:90%
on this particular point.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And he would give a very
succinct answer to that,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and then again he would
spread out like this.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.772 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the way a wave
functions as you measure it,

00:15:46.772 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:90%
it's the particle here.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And woomph, you see?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it spreads
out again, like this.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> They'd finally developed
sufficient computing power

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
needed to run the complex
mathematics required

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to describe Bohm's
hidden variables.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it'd be a very
valuable thing if we could show

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:10%
clearly how Bohm's '52 theory
worked in the two slits

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:10%
experiment, because obviously,
the two slits experiment is

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:10%
the iconic experiment in the
interpretation of quantum

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:10%
theory.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so Basil went off
and read the papers.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I set about calculating the
particle trajectories for this.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Phillipidis produced
the quantum potential picture.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what Chris was
an absolute master at, was

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
actually developing computer
programs to actually simulate

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
this, and let's have a look
at what is going on here.

what could it mean.

only functions when
quantum phenomena appear.

That is, in the particle

it is the quantum

a clear prediction about

the nonlocality of the world.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:90%
What is nonlocality?

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Nonlocality is really, to
put it in simple words,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the profound discovery
of the interconnectedness

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
of the universe at the
fundamental level of quantum.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that conflicts deeply right
away with relativity theory,

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.020 align:middle line:84%
where it says, no, the
speed of light is limited.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Everything is local.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
so how could everything
be instantaneously

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:90%
interconnected in the universe?

And that's the big clash
that we have today.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why also Bohm's
theory of hidden variables,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
which are nonlocal, has really
been rejected from the start.

>> It seems strange to us.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:10%

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:10%
But if we want to make sense
of a theory, that matters also.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when a theory
seems strange, we get past it.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.858 align:middle line:84%
And other times when
it seems strange,

00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
it's pointing us to
something that we

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:90%
haven't understood well enough.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It really says that
there exists a hidden regime

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
of reality in which
everything is interconnected,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but no person,
even in the future,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:03.477 align:middle line:84%
will be able to access
that domain and control it.

00:21:03.477 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is also what
the mystical traditions

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
tell us, that we must be
humble in front of reality,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that there will always be
domains of reality that

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
will remain beyond science,
beyond the scientific method,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
will remain beyond access
by scientific agents.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And if the quantum potential
is discovered in this way

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and nonlocality is proven, then
the existence of that domain

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:90%
is proven.

wholeness in here.

Here, we agree with Bohm.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that quantum mechanics
introduces is a kind

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
of wholeness, which means
we cannot analyze things

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
by cutting them up into little
bits as we do in classical

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do is, if we
want to try and cut it up,

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that the way one bit
goes into the next bit

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
actually involves
unfolding into the whole

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and then enfolding back again
into a particular region.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you get this idea
of unfolding, enfolding,

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
unfolding, enfolding.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:10%

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:10%
that you are the
determiner of what you see.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:10%
This is a mess of
I think elements

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:10%
that are both particles
and, hopefully, trajectories

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.540 align:middle line:10%
that come together.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:10%
And depending on where your
position is, either in a boat

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:10%
or walking along the
side of the Thames,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:10%
and depending on
the time of day,

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:10%
you will see or not see
the possibility of a body.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics invites us to be
participators in that emerging

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of a world.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And it has very,
very fundamental,

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, both
philosophical, spiritual,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and political implications,
which are essentially

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that each of us is a co-producer
of a world, that each of us

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.155 align:middle line:84%
is a co-producer of
a possible future.

00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The work of people
like Einstein and Bohm,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
they are like huge windows
opening in the imagination

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to a way of dealing
with life and the things

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
we encounter within it
freshly and, in a sense,

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.380 align:middle line:84%
with the right level
of uncertainty.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:90%

>> The present ego
identity is based, I think,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
on a wrong mode of
thought, you see,

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:84%
in which a person identifies
with his thoughts and with his

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:84%
body and with things, you see,
which means that he's creating

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
an illusion, that this self
which people feel they have is

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:90%
only a show.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not really there.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But it is such a convincing
show that everybody

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.127 align:middle line:84%
acts as if it were
there, and that

00:27:56.127 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:90%
gives it an apparent reality.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the most essential
points of the scientific spirit

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:84%
is to acknowledge the fact, or
the interpretation of the fact,

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
whether you like it
or not, that is not

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to engage in wishful thinking
or not to reject something

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:90%
because you don't like it.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible scientifically
to define this wholeness?

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, not really.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Wholeness is an attitude or
an approach, but it can be,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
given a scientific
realization, you see--

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I think two levels,
interdependency.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, external things,
different nations,

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
different country,
environment, and human beings,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:90%
other animals.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.835 align:middle line:90%
Everything interdependent.

00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, according
to that reality,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to take care about the
whole world and environment.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We are internally
related to everything,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:90%
not externally related.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is an internal
relationship to the whole.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
We take in the whole and
we act toward the whole.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And that, in turn,
whatever we have taken in

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
determines, basically,
what we are.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When we pass through some
sort of forest, no bird,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:90%
we feel something missing.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
When we're passing through
some birds singing,

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
some birds flying,
then we feel more full.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's now the reality.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So interdependency
on that level.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:10%

talking about how the
subject/object split,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:10%
duality emerges from a ground,
which Lao Tzu would call

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:12.995 align:middle line:10%
the Dao, which is non-subject,
non-object, but a unity,

00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:10%
a wholeness.

and sometimes meditation.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:90%
No instrument.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:90%
No modern science.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Use instrument.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Science is whatever
people make of it.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:84%
You see, science has
changed over the ages,

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's different now from
a few hundred years ago,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and it could be different again.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's no intrinsic reason
why science must necessarily

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:10%
be measurement.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
This is another
historical development

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
which has come about over
the past few centuries.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's entirely contingent,
and not absolutely necessary.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> So far, we know this much.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Still limitless the reality we
have to sort of investigate.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So David Bohm, I think, really
something like open our mind.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.968 align:middle line:90%

in order to benefit humanity.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I think his mission
was always leading up

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to a transformation
for human society,

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:84%
overcoming the fragmentation
that we experience

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
towards having the experience
of a new interconnectedness

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:84%
among us all to solve
problems together,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
overcoming the divisions.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.610 align:middle line:84%

integrated vision
of a human being.

00:31:57.537 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%

he can serve as a model
