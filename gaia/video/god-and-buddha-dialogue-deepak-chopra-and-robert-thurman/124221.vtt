00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>This?

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>No, you have the mike.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.204 align:middle line:90%
>>No, we don't.

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:12.004 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:18.722 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I think we're set.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, everyone.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's great fun to
have you here, Deepak.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.212 align:middle line:90%
Welcome so much to Tibet House.

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:30.419 align:middle line:90%
We're really grateful for it.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.358 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>We really are.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.322 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Thanks.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.967 align:middle line:84%
>>And Deepak and I have
been doing different things.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's really wonderful
to discover you, Deepak.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So now anyway,
tonight, I guess we're

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:84%
going to mediate, or discuss,
the meeting, the encounter

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
of Buddha and God,
whatever that is.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
They have had some
encounters in the past,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.132 align:middle line:84%
I believe, actually, as recorded
in the various scriptures

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:90%
from the Buddhist side.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
in the Abrahamic--

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they have any
account of Jehovah meeting

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Buddha.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
He didn't report back on it
anyway-- at least not to Moses.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'll turn the
floor over to you,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.109 align:middle line:84%
and you lead off
in this dialogue.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>It's all right if I stand up?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>I'll be more comfortable.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was thinking
as I was traveling

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to New York-- because we hadn't
actually announced the topic--

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
or I wasn't aware of what
the topic was going to be--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
but what I was struggling with
was the idea that-- looking

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
back at my own life,
personally, I've been always

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
interested in the abstract,
in the metaphysical,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
in these great journeys into
the infinite and the unbounded

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and the eternal, and trying to
figure it out intellectually.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And about less
than a year ago-- I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
don't know the exact date--
I was at the Royal Albert

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
Hall in England and
happened to have

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
a very wonderful private
meeting with His Holiness

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:90%
the Dalai Lama.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And we got into some
abstract discussions--

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
because that's where I always
direct people, even the Dalai

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Lama.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped me
in the middle of it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and he said, it's
interesting, and one

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
can go on into
abstractions forever,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:90%
but how does it change our life?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And how does
knowing what you are

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to express
right now-- how does it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
change people's lives?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that His
Holiness-- even though he

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
can if he wants to take the
same journeys even into a more

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
extended domain of awareness--
that he's a very practical man.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately
what really matters

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is the essence of Buddhism is
the alleviation of suffering.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Even the Buddha
himself was not really

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.442 align:middle line:84%
interested in the abstractions
of reincarnation theories

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
or the different
realms of being--

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
even though Tibetan Buddhism
is the authority in all

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:90%
of those areas.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha himself was only
interested in one question--

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
what is the cause
of human suffering,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and what is the way out of it?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the essence of
Buddhism basically.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not going to
steal the thunder from Bob--

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Steal away.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>--who's the
expert in this area,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to start off with
just that one question from

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:90%
a Vedantic perspective.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Please.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Then perhaps what
we can do is draw

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the parallels between
Vedanta and Buddhism

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:90%
if that's all right.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Because essentially it's a
question of semantics, I think.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So Vedanta, which is the great
wisdom tradition of India that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
goes back at least 1500 BC--
and the authors of the Vedanta

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
are the great Rishis who
span several eras of time,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
especially the ones who
wrote the Upanishads.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
If I could summarize
what Vedanta says about

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
the subject-- and, in fact,
if I could summarize the whole

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of Vedanta in the
next 10 minutes--

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
it would be as follows--

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Vedanta says that there
are five reasons why

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
human beings suffer,
and these five

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:90%
are called kleshas in Sanskrit.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
K-L-E-S-H-A-S. The first klesha,
or the first cause of human

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
suffering, is not knowing
the true nature of reality.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Number one-- not knowing
the true nature of reality.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
The second klesha-- number
two-- is clinging to or grasping

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
or holding on to that which
is ephemeral, transitory,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.378 align:middle line:84%
illusionary, insubstantial,
and therefore not real.

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:90%
The second cause of suffering.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The third cause of suffering--
the third klesha-- is aversion

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to, revulsion to,
fear from, or fear

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
of that which is insubstantial,
transitory ephemeral, not real,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:90%
illusionary.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The fourth cause of
suffering is identification

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
with the false and
constricted and habitual self,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:90%
which we call the ego.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth cause of
suffering-- the fifth klesha--

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:90%
is the fear of death.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%
And Vedanta says, that's it.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
These are the five reasons
why humans suffer--

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
not knowing the true
nature of reality,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
grasping to things
that aren't real,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
running away from and fearing
things that are not real,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
identification
with a false self--

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
a constricted self--
and the fear of death.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
All other causes of suffering
can be somehow connected

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:90%
to these five.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And then Vedanta goes on
to say that these five are

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:90%
contained in the first one.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The five kleshas are
contained in the first one.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So the only cause
of suffering is not

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
knowing the true
nature of reality.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
The only cause of
suffering is not

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:84%
knowing the true
nature of reality.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Vedanta says the true nature
of reality is Brahman.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Brahman is a word,
like any other.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.805 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask a Vedantist
to describe it, he can't.

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
He says he/she cannot
describe what Brahman is,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:90%
except to call it that.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:90%
T-H-A-T. The English word that.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:90%
In Sanskrit, tat.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Tat.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Tat.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And Vedanta says, I am that,
you are that, all this is

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that, that's all there is.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.469 align:middle line:84%
And if you really,
really get that, then I

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
have nothing more to say.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Good night.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Vedantists refer
to Brahman as that.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It's immortal.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It's ineffable.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's unbounded.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It is silent.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It has infinite dynamism.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It has infinite intelligence.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And it is it, whatever it is.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And this Brahman projects
itself as the universe

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
through what is called
the power of Maya.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Brahman projects itself
as the physical universe,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
including you and me,
through the power of Maya.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
The word Maya means--
technically, etymologically--

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
it means measurement, although
it's translated frequently

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
as illusion, because what you're
trying to measure is eternity,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
or the infinite.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the measurement
of the infinite,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
you create the concept of
time and you give birth

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:90%
to the relative universe.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So Maya, measurement, meter--
the English word meter,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
which also is something you
use to measure-- Maya, meter,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
measurement, time,
music, matter, all refer

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to the womb of creation, which
is the infinite, unbounded womb

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
of creation which
projects itself

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
through the power of Maya
into the realm of space-time

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and causation.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And it does so through
the web of karma.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Karma is our own past actions
on an individual level,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
but also on a collective
level, and ultimately

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
from a deeper, more
mythical level.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The remnants of karma--
our past actions-- they

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
are like seeds in
our consciousness.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And these remnants
of karma constantly

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
actualize into our consciousness
as our subjective experience.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:84%
They're just the seeds of past
memories, past experiences.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They're not the
memories themselves.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:90%
They are virtual memories.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Just like you have virtual
photons and virtual particles,

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
they're virtual memories
that don't actually

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
exist in the brain,
because they are part

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:90%
of the software of our souls.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I was watching the other
day on "60 minutes"

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the person who just wrote
Mr. Reagan's biography.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.065 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
saw that program,

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
but there's a very
poignant moment

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in the program where
he says that he's

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:90%
a family friend of Mr. Reagan.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And apparently Mr.
Reagan recently

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
came from a therapy session.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And somebody had left
a toy White House

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
next to the fish tank.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Reagan was
clutching onto it--

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:90%
holding onto it when he came.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And Nancy Reagan tried
to pry his fingers open,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and he wouldn't let go of it.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And finally she
said to him, Ronnie,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:90%
what's that in your hand?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it for a
minute or so, and he said,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is, but I think

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:90%
it has something to do with me.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is, but I think

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:90%
it has something to do with me.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what a sanskara is.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what a
potential memory is.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the remnant of karma.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that program
and realized we all have

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.516 align:middle line:84%
We all have spiritual
Alzheimer's.

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm very relieved
to hear that.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>I thought it was only me.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%
We have this memory.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:84%
We have this faint memory
that somewhere there

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is a soul over here--
a faint memory that

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:90%
somewhere there's a soul here.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
We know it has
something to do with me,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:90%
and we have no idea what it is.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Vedanta says is
the cause of all our suffering.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Bible
says that, too.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
What good does it do a man
to find the whole world

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:90%
but lose his own soul?

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And losing the soul,
we begin to have

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:90%
the experience of suffering.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So this karmic software,
which is constantly

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
actualizing into
our consciousness,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
it appears as our own thoughts,
our own memories, our desires,

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%
our feelings, our emotions.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And during the daytime what
we do is-- our rational mind,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
it weaves stories around
this karmic software.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
It does so quite logically,
at least to the rational mind.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And we live out these stories.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
We call them everyday reality.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happens at night,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.500 align:middle line:90%
but the rational mind is asleep.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And so there is not a consistent
logic to the stories at night,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:90%
and we call them dreams.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
But Vedanta says the mechanics
of the dream and the mechanics

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:84%
of waking state of
consciousness, it's the same.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
One is being given a
rationalization and the other

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
isn't, but it's just your karmic
software that is appearing

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness
and that you're

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:84%
making stories out
of them and you're

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%
living these stories out.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And you get so caught
up in the melodrama

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and the hysteria of the
stories that you actually

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
forget who you are.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
a really good movie

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and getting lost in the movie.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the only way
to come out of this tangled

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:84%
hierarchy-- because it is a
tangled hierarchy where we lose

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in the scenery--

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
The seer loses itself
in the scenery.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
The lover loses
himself in the beloved.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
The knower loses
himself or herself

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
in the objects of
knowledge, never remembering

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that there is a timeless
factor in the midst

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of every time-bound experience.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:90%
All experience is time-bound.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It has a beginning, a
middle, and an ending.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But in the midst of all this,
there's a timeless factor.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the experiencer.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And the experiencer is
the "I" inside, not just

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the personal "I," but
the collective "I"

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and the universal "I."

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
That if I start to peel
the layers of my soul,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll go beyond my
constricted fabrication--

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
the constricted self-identity
that I have-- and I'll

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:90%
discover who I really am.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.555 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
essence of Vedanta.

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And Vedanta says there
are four ways to do it.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
The first is called
Karma Yoga, which

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is to be always
reminding yourself

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what you're
doing, you're not doing it.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It's God.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:90%
God does everything.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
There is only God, and
this is the machinery

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:84%
through which that divine
intelligence is working.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So the essence of Karma Yoga
is to be established in being

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:90%
and perform action.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Yogastha Kuru Karmani
as Lord Krishna

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:90%
says in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The second way to
find the truth--

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to find the nature of
reality-- is through love--

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
the experience of love, which
is Bhakti Yoga, or devotion.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's the simplest
and most enjoyable,

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
but it gets you
to the same place.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second
means to find the truth.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Because love is the
ultimate reality.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:90%
And love is not a mere emotion.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Love is not a mere sentiment.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate truth
at the heart of creation.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate truth
at the heart of creation

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we are all the same
being in different disguises.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
When we feel that,
then it becomes

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:90%
impossible to hurt or be hurt.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
What the Buddha refers
to as compassion

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:84%
is really also the
experiential knowledge

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
of love as the ultimate truth
at the heart of creation.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
The third means is
Raja Yoga, which

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is meditation and its
allied disciplines,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
all the different
types of ways to dive

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
into the gap between
our thoughts,

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond the secret
passages and the dark alleys

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of our minds and find this part
of ourselves that does not die.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
discipline of Raja Yoga,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
the meditation and its allied
principles, or techniques.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth means is
what is called Gyan Yoga.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I've lost myself
in that for my entire life.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Gyan Yoga is the
intellectual approach,

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
which is also called the
razor's edge, because you're

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
using the intellect to
go beyond the intellect

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and that in itself
seems to be a paradox.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:84%
But it's possible
to use the intellect

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and go beyond the
intellect ultimately,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
to go beyond the rational way.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And that, essentially,
is all of Vedanta.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
All the 112 Upanishads,
somehow or the other,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
talk around these
few principles.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
If one has gotten close to
the event horizon, which

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is called enlightenment in
both the Vedantic tradition

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Buddhist tradition,
then that experiential knowledge

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
of immortality
solves all suffering,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
because you find out
who you really are.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
As the Sufi poet Rumi has
said in one of his most

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
elegant poems-- he says, by
God, when you see your beauty,

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
you'll be the idol of yourself.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I've just done a new
translation of Tagore's poems.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I chose his poems on the
phenomenon and the experience

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of death because I've always
wondered what would it

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
be like to be in that
place in your consciousness

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
where you have lost all
fear and can embrace death

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
as lovingly and in as
much a celebratory mood

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:90%
as you can approach life.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You can only do it if
you have come home.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like
to do before I end

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is read to you
about three or four

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of these contemporary
translations

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that I have just
done from Tagore.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll wear my fancy
glasses to do that.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But you can see what it
must be to be in that place.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
These poems were written by
the Indian poet Tagore, who

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
won the Nobel Prize in 1913.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Bengali poet, who
was not just a poet.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
He was a real Rishi,
he was a real seer,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and he had really
understood Vedanta.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And towards the end
of his life, when

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.422 align:middle line:84%
he was approaching his so-called
death, this is what he wrote.

00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to read you--
just for a minute or two--

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:90%
what he said.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I know
that the day will

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
come when my sight of
this earth shall be lost,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and life will take
its leave in silence,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
drawing the last
curtain over my eyes.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet stars will watch at night,
and morning rise as before,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and hours heave like sea waves
casting up pleasures and pains.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
When I think of this
end of my moments,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the barrier of
the moments breaks

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and I see by the light
of death your world

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:90%
with its careless treasures.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Rare is its lowliest seat,
rare is its meanest of lives.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Things that I longed for in
vain and things that I got--

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
let them pass.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Let me but truly
possess the things

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.615 align:middle line:84%
that I ever spurned
and overlooked."

00:20:26.615 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Other people have said
that if you were aware

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that death is stalking you
right now-- I look behind myself

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Prince of Death is
stalking me, and, in fact,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
if I look back
again, it's closer.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
If I was aware that
death is stalking me

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
in every moment of
my life, my life

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
would be magical because I
would change my priorities.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
As he says, "things
that I longed for

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and things that I
got-- let them pass.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me but truly
possess the things

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that I ever spurned
and overlooked."

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, again, he says--
and look at the splendor

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and magnificence of his
mood as he approaches

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
his final moments-- "At
this time of my parting,

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
wish me good luck, my friends!

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
The sky is flushed with the
dawn and my path lies beautiful.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Ask not what I have
with me to take there.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I start on my journey with empty
hands and an expectant heart.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I shall put on my
wedding garland.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Mine is not the red-brown
dress of the traveler,

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and though there are
dangers on the way

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I have no fear in my mind.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The evening star will come
out when my voyage is done

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and the plaintive notes
of the twilight melodies

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
will be struck up from
the King's highway."

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And one or two more--

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
"I was not aware of the
moment when I first crossed

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
the threshold of this life.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
What was the power
that made me open out

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:11.450 align:middle line:84%
into this vast mystery like a
bud in the forest at midnight?

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
When in the morning I
looked upon the light,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt in a moment that I was
no stranger in this world,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that the inscrutable
without name and form

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
had taken me in its arms in
the form of my own mother.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Even so, in death
the same unknown

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:90%
will appear as ever known to me.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And because I love
this life, I know

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I shall love death as well.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The child cries out when
from the right breast

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
the mother takes it away
in the very next moment

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to find in the left
one its consolation."

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:90%
And the final one--

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
"When I go from hence, let
this be my parting word,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that what I have seen
is unsurpassable.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I have tasted of the hidden
honey of this lotus that

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
expands on the ocean of life
and light, and so I am blessed.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Let this be my parting word.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
In this playhouse of infinite
forms, I have had my play

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and here I have caught sight
of him that is formless.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
My whole body and
my whole limbs have

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
thrilled with his touch
who is beyond touch.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And if the end comes
here, let it come.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Let this be my parting word."

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.028 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:23:32.028 --> 00:23:33.492 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Deepak.

00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:36.944 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:36.944 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
What I feel in my
heart really is

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
like a feeling of
tribute to India,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
to the great Mahabharata,
great Mother India.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow in the dawn
of the world-- 2,500 years ago

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
or 3,000 years ago-- the dawn of
this recent era of the world--

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
somehow India is the great
place where people really saw

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:90%
most deeply, I think, really.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This American, Euro
American culture,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
the sort of product of New York
that produced New York, that

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
produced some
aspects of ourselves,

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:84%
our conditioning is based
in the Mediterranean.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Things of itself, as coming
from the Mediterranean.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But actually the Mediterranean
was connected by a toll road,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.947 align:middle line:84%
like the superhighway
of that time that

00:24:35.947 --> 00:24:37.405 align:middle line:84%
was maintained by
the Achaemenids--

00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the Persians-- which went
right to the Indus River.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And every conqueror worth their
salt in the Mediterranean world

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:84%
wanted nothing better but to go
to India and conquer something.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what, but they knew

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to get there because
they knew that people in India

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.178 align:middle line:90%
were having more fun.

00:24:56.178 --> 00:24:57.492 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.492 --> 00:24:58.506 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.506 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted, of
course, to go ahead

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.394 align:middle line:90%
and grab that themselves.

00:25:01.394 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They were there with
their olives and Retsina,

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were dreaming of
2,500 varieties of mango.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly, that
land of such a great wealth--

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
by far the greatest illuvia
of Eurasia-- the Ma Harrappan

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
civilization-- Mohenjo-daro--
the five rivers of the Indus--

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
was at its height
15 times larger

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:84%
than ancient Egypt, a larger
illuvium with more people

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and more wealth and
more produce and so on.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore it is
in such a country

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that-- such a land--
that people first came

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to both Veda and then Vedanta.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Veda meaning knowledge.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Vedanta meaning, in a way,
the end of knowledge--

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
the final conclusion
of knowledge.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It occurs to me,
too, that somehow

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the great
Vedantists really

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
was Buddha in the sense that
the Vedantic revolution,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
you could say, in the middle
of the first millennium

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
before the Common Era--
or starting, really,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.686 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
the first millennium

00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:84%
before the Common Era but
ending in the middle--

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
was the time when people threw
off the first level of God--

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
the god, the protector,
the tribal god,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
god the one who is
somehow connected

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
with your fight for survival.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Because in India at
that time, survival

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:90%
became relatively easy.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Things were relatively
well-organized.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Life was more gentle really
actually in that place.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And so people threw
off that and they

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:41.189 align:middle line:84%
decided that the human
being need not fear reality.

00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And they decided
that the human being

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
was capable of knowing reality.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:90%
This was the great insight.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize,
Deepak, in 10 minutes

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.549 align:middle line:84%
you brilliantly conveyed
the essence of Vedanta?

00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the very first
thing that you said

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
was everything was
contained, too,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%
which is that the only
reason that we suffer

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is that we do not know
what our own reality is.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And that do not knowing is--
and Buddha put it sometimes,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
he put it to force
just like that.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.509 align:middle line:90%
There was no difference.

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
The first thing-- I want to
definitively announce there

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.249 align:middle line:84%
is no difference between
Buddha Dharma and Vedanta.

00:27:16.249 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely no difference.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.409 align:middle line:84%
Some semantic confusion
people attach to,

00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:21.825 align:middle line:84%
but really there
is no difference.

00:27:21.825 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The crux and the essence of
it is that this not knowing

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
is not merely just like I don't
know what is in that pipe.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I do not know what
is behind that wall.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
That sort of not knowing
doesn't really hurt me.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The kind of not knowing is that
I think I do know what I am,

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I think I do know what you are.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm Bob.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
You are Deepak.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And Bob is not Deepak.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And somehow Bob is not you.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And Bob is like
therefore worrying

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many more
of you than there is Bob.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so if I think you
and Bob are different,

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
then it's like, well,
who's going to get whom?

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Who is safe from whom?

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Then I think, maybe
God is not me.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, maybe this
pillar is not me.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:90%
The floor, the objects.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I misknow myself
as a separate self.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I misknow the other
as a separate other.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm put in the situation,
therefore put myself

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:84%
through this misknowing in
the situation of struggling

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:90%
You struggle with the universe.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.767 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think
is going to win?

00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You know you're going
to lose, of course.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now and
then you're feeling

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
a little bit excited or happy
or wearing a Donna Karan suit,

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.775 align:middle line:90%
maybe you think you'll win.

00:28:56.775 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, you feel so good.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But underneath, you
know you'll lose.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that you
can be a little giddy

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:84%
about how it's fine,
but in the long run

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:90%
you know you are going to lose.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you know your nature,
you know that we are the same.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Reality is one.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.170 align:middle line:90%
You are the universe.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
How can you lose?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no opponent, you see.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.032 align:middle line:84%
And this is the wonderful
thing about India.

00:29:26.032 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It comes from India
the idea that we can

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.270 align:middle line:90%
know our way free of suffering.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.399 align:middle line:84%
Now you could call
it Jnana Yoga,

00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
you can call it Bhakti
Yoga, this and that,

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but it isn't just intellectual,
because this kind of Jnana

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:90%
is not mere intellectual.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It is, of course,
not not intellectual,

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:84%
because knowing the nature
of needs the intellect

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:90%
at least to get focused.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But then through
Raja Yoga method,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
through meditative thing,
through Karma Yoga,

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
through acting in a way
that you are acting in tuned

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with everything, and
finally through love--

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
because once you know
you are everything then

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:84%
you're way of experiencing
energy-wise being everything

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:90%
is the same thing as love.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Why do we like being in love?

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
when we're not in love

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
we're all alone
against the universe

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's outdoing
us all the time.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly we feel one with
another being-- usually is

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:90%
all we can manage.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.375 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:30:33.375 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually also
temporary because we,

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:84%
for that moment where
we're really happy in love

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is where we're only
living for the happiness

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:90%
of the other being.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
We lose ourselves
in the beloved.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.090 align:middle line:90%
We die in the beloved.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then at a certain point,
we feel, that's enough of that.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
How much are they
losing themself in me?

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately the
separation is reaffirmed.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like,
who is more with who?

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's endless
dissatisfaction.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But that moment, that
expansion of the identity

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:14.186 align:middle line:84%
to be two or two
as one, imagine,

00:31:14.186 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
therefore, like in the
state of enlightenment

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
our actual reality,
our actual birthright

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
as human beings-- as
aware, reflective beings--

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
which is that we have
the ability, the right,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and the natural
tendency to be in love

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
with all beings, the entire
universe all of the time.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.010 align:middle line:90%
God is means.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:90%
God the lover.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:84%
God means being in
love with everything.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And love, especially also
it means-- remember love--

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bhakti--
doesn't mean just

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:90%
wishing to possess the beloved.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Love means willing the
happiness of the beloved.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the endless
expansion into happiness.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So I have to hail India.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Plato, Socrates was into it.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He saw the harmony of the
soul and he saw something

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:90%
getting out of the cave.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But he was there with
all those tyrants.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And all they had was olives
and a little bit of goat burger

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:90%
and some Retsina, a few fish.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:90%
No big illuvium.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:90%
No Greek could manage.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:84%
They had to go and conquer
Egypt to get some wheat

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.860 align:middle line:84%
because you can't grow that
much in these non-illuvial

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.947 align:middle line:90%
countries-- seafaring countries.

00:32:32.947 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to thank India for this
and this rediscovery of India

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.284 align:middle line:84%
I can confidently announce--
although I'm always

00:32:45.284 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
confidently announcing that
something will happen tomorrow

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
which never happens-- that's
been doing this for 40 years.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%
And probably it's posthumous.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Later, after I
attain nirvana or I'm

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
reborn again as
an undergraduate.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.042 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm nice
to my undergraduates.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I try to be.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We have not completed our
renaissance in the West.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The West's renaissance
is just beginning.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Its first wave was the discovery
of the humanism and naturalism

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Greeks, breaking away
from the grip of the church

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and the grip of a
lower idea of God--

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that God the punisher,
God the ruler,

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.760 align:middle line:84%
God is doing this-- that
mostly was dominating people

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
feeling that their minds were
unworthy, that they could not

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
understand the
nature of reality.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered, well,
we can't understand nature,

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:84%
but then nature was defined
as material nature--

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
the atom, the mathematics,
the geometry, the pivot.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so then for
500 years now we've

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:84%
been discovering nature--
the human nature and nature.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've been breaking
away from that spirit.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are scared of spirit
because we associate spirit

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Inquisition, with
some sort of [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.178 align:middle line:84%
So we're running
away from the spirit.

00:34:09.178 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:84%
And we think our
renaissance is over.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
And then some people even
say, well, that was no good.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the Enlightenment--
it caused a lot of trouble.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're even
giving up, you know.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
But our Renaissance
really gets rolling

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:90%
when we rediscover India.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I have
to hail to you, Deepak,

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:84%
because, in a way, you
are the voice of India.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:34.042 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, you are
educated as a Westerner.

00:34:34.042 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:84%
When we did our dialogue
at Columbia, remember,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.993 align:middle line:84%
it was so funny because
you were doing science

00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:90%
and I was doing India.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.325 align:middle line:84%
I was saying, but wait a minute,
Indian science, remember?

00:34:42.325 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>It was counterpoint.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But, you see, India gives us the
courage that we can understand.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that preposterous?

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think-- if you said
today-- you went and announced

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to your employees, to your
friends, to your relatives,

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:84%
ah, I understand my
nature, I understand

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.297 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality-- if
you announced that, what

00:35:04.297 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
do you think they would do?

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.780 align:middle line:84%
They would offer you
a dish of Prozac.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Or St. John's Wort,
I hope, or maybe

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:90%
just some nice Ayurvedic remedy.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Because religious,
you can't do that.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Only God knows that on the
religious side in the West.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:90%
So nobody can know everything.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And on the scientific
side, you know how they do.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They get billions of dollars,
and they study and study.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.965 align:middle line:84%
And then when they run out of
the dollars, they proclaim,

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:84%
aha, we learned a
great deal and now we

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
know so much more about
how much we don't know.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:90%
So give us another grand.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in principle,
you cannot know.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:90%
You cannot understand.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, of course, they do
announce-- when their grant

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:84%
providers are getting
discouraged with them--

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:84%
they occasionally
announce that, well, we

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:84%
will be knowing another
60 years of calculations

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
will bear us out.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll have the grand
theory, so give us

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.230 align:middle line:90%
another 60 years to prove it.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in India from this
ancient time, they're saying,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:90%
you don't need a machine.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:90%
You don't even need mathematics.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's an
ornament mathematic.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:90%
These machines are useful.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need that because
you are the wondrous machine.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Long before computers
in this cybernetic age,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
you are the wondrous
machine that

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
can turn around
in your footsteps,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:84%
look back into yourself, and
fully understand yourself--

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:84%
completely understand that
you are not-- there's nothing

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:84%
in you separate from the
great self of the universe.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:84%
As a Vedantic would say
and Buddha would say,

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
you are selfless with
regard to that petty self.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And your great self
of selflessness

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:84%
is at one with all beings
and has all knowledge

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
available to it,
knows everything

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.960 align:middle line:90%
by being one with everything.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.547 align:middle line:84%
And when you know that-- and
that's what I always-- I'm

00:37:01.547 --> 00:37:03.880 align:middle line:84%
always thinking-- there's
Buddha over there, by the way,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
standing over there--
an image-- and there

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:90%
is another one sitting.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always-- when I look
at Buddha, I'm thinking,

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.500 align:middle line:90%
thank goodness he's smiling.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Imagine-- now I
understand everything.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the next minute you're
going, oh, no, what a bummer,

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Then we would all be depressed.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But instead they said,
well, when you know,

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:90%
then you are happy, you see.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.135 align:middle line:84%
It's only by not knowing
that you're unhappy.

00:37:35.135 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize the
vast difference

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:90%
in those two possible claims?

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if our reality
is in fact happiness,

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:84%
if our reality is in fact
love, if our reality is

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:84%
in fact wisdom, that
means the more we

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
can let go of our false
constructions of unreality,

00:37:54.590 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:84%
the more we collapse actually,
the more happy we become.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
fight with even--

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I was very happy you
announced that we all

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:84%
have Alzheimer's, because when I
can't remember anybody's name--

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I call my children
by the wrong names--

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:84%
when I can't remember who I am,
then I must be getting happier.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I must be getting better.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.541 align:middle line:84%
I only get miserable when
someone comes and says,

00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
you should know
exactly this and that.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget that
name, that's terrible.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to know
someone's name to love them.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sometimes by
knowing their name too well

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
you might get used to
disliking them, in fact.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:84%
If you forget that you
know-- sometimes I do.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I meet some people nowadays
and they seem to know me.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, you're
not mad at me anymore.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I say, I guess not.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell me what you did.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.434 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:38:51.434 --> 00:38:54.070 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so it is India that
gives us this encouragement.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And therefore India turned--
in this ancient time--

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in a different direction
than the Greeks

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and then the Romans and
then the Europeans and then

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:90%
the Americans.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
They turned-- what I
call-- towards-- they

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.770 align:middle line:90%
did the inward turn.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
They said that the king and
the queen of the sciences

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is the inward science--
the science of how

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to know yourself, how
to know your world,

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
how to know the gods, how
to know God-- depending

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.726 align:middle line:90%
on what you mean by it.

00:39:27.726 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedanta, they
have this wonderful idea

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
they call Nirguna Brahman
and Saguna Brahman-- showing

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:84%
how they qualify--
that means qualified

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.680 align:middle line:84%
God-- God with properties,
God with personality,

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:90%
God with attitude.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was like putting
a burning bush someplace

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:84%
or destroying somebody
who gets him mad.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the kind of
God with attitude.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
God beyond attitude.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And God beyond attitude
is no different from us,

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.843 align:middle line:84%
and therefore nothing
to be afraid of.

00:39:52.843 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, OK.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So the first klesha, that's my
feeling about the first klesha.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:90%
So now I'll turn it back to you.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>I just have to say
one thing, and that

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
is that where our
science is going today--

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.660 align:middle line:84%
the direction our
science is going today--

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:84%
is actually coming very close
to this Vedantic or Buddhist

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.020 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Because if you look
at our technology

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
today, whether it's
sending someone an e-mail

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:84%
or surfing on the internet
or using a cell phone,

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:84%
all these technologies are based
on a very fundamental premise

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.060 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And that fundamental
premise in science

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is that the essential
nature of the material world

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not material,
that the essential nature

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world is
that it's not physical,

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that the essential stuff of
the universe is non-stuff.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But not only is it non-stuff,
it's thinking non-stuff.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go
into the atom and you

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
go beyond the atom--
which is the basis of all

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
our technology--
what do you find?

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.810 align:middle line:90%
You find an empty void.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And this empty void
is not a nothingness.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the womb of creation.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Full of energy.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.375 align:middle line:90%
>>Full of energy.

00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:18.333 align:middle line:90%
>>It's infinite energy.

00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Infinite energy and
infinite information.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it information,
it's information that

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:90%
feeds back on its own self.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:90%
It has a feedback loop.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And when information
becomes self-referral,

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:90%
then it's no longer information.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Living information is
living intelligence.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So nowhere-- no matter where
the computer programmers

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:45.730 align:middle line:84%
go with their sophisticated
feedback loops--

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:84%
nowhere in that model-- unless
you explain consciousness

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and understand this
Vedantic/Buddhist perspective--

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.640 align:middle line:84%
nowhere is there an
explanation for what

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:07.340 align:middle line:84%
we call free will or insight
or intention or imagination

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
or inspiration or creativity
or knowingness or understanding

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%
or decision-making or meaning.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The meaning, the understanding,
the insight, the intent--

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
no matter how sophisticated
artificial intelligence

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.840 align:middle line:84%
becomes, it doesn't
lie in the program.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It lies in the consciousness
of the programmer.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.854 align:middle line:84%
>>And if you use
symbols-- you say,

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll use symbols to give
meaning-- then you'll

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.650 align:middle line:84%
have to create other symbols
to explain the symbols that

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:90%
give the meaning.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.541 align:middle line:84%
>>So no matter where
you go, ultimately you

00:42:45.541 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%
get into-- there is nothing
out there that is not

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I. There is nothing
out there that is not

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I. The very fact of
something separate from me

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.270 align:middle line:90%
is a fundamental illusion.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But it can't be just
an intellectual idea.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the experience
that-- what being in love

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:90%
is actually.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.778 align:middle line:84%
>>You made me
remember-- I actually

00:43:14.778 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:90%
wanted to finish-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.411 align:middle line:84%
But you made me remember
what I wanted to finish,

00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:84%
which is the great Bengali
Atisa Dipankara Shrijnana--

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:84%
who went to Tibet in the 11th
century and was the founder

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of the new wave of Tibetan
Buddhism at that time--

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.240 align:middle line:84%
he was asked once-- because you
made me think of it when you

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.110 align:middle line:84%
mentioned about abstraction
and practical living--

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:84%
He was asked once-- he
said, well, Atisa, you're

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the great master, you taught all
the Dharma, blah, blah, blah.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, but could you
tell us a practical thing--

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.370 align:middle line:84%
one Tibetan nobelman said--
he said, well, what is that?

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, could you give
us a little marriage counseling?

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.072 align:middle line:84%
This is my favorite marriage
counseling in the universe.

00:43:54.072 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And Atisa, said, oh, no,
you go talk to someone else.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Then he said, no, please, we
want some marriage counseling.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.514 align:middle line:90%
So then he said, OK, you ready?

00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:03.555 align:middle line:90%
And he said, we're ready.

00:44:03.555 --> 00:44:10.945 align:middle line:84%
He said, husband and wife,
each of them will soon be dead.

00:44:10.945 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Therefore while living they
should be nice to each other.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.366 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite Tagore, but it's
to the point, don't you think?

00:44:23.366 --> 00:44:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm sorry.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Go ahead.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:90%
But death is great, you know.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:84%
When I translated the
"Book of the Dead"-- which

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to do
because I thought

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:90%
there were enough translations.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But then I remembered my
guru-- my old Mongolian guru

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:84%
who was the teacher of--
where do we cross paths-- oh,

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Ray Chambers' teacher, too--
who I met in the desert

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:48.664 align:middle line:90%
flats of New Jersey.

00:44:48.664 --> 00:44:50.288 align:middle line:84%
You know what it
means for a New Yorker

00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:84%
to go-- I went all the
way to India first,

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and then I met him in the
desert flats of New Jersey--

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.380 align:middle line:84%
my guru-- just beyond
the refineries there.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a real shock
to a New Yorker.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Talk about non-duality.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And-- what was I going to say?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>He convinced you
to write about death.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me this book.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said one time-- the copy
of the "Book of the Dead"--

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't at all interested
in it-- and I said, oh,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.860 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.901 align:middle line:90%
I keep it in the library.

00:45:17.901 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, you take it.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:90%
You will need it, he said.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.477 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, OK.

00:45:22.477 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Then later someone asked
me to translate it.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And because he had
done that, I said,

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll do it, because
he said I would need it.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But what I discovered in
translating the so-called "Book

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.606 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead"-- which isn't
called "Book of the Dead"

00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in Tibetan-- I discovered
that there are no dead people.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.220 align:middle line:90%
There's no dead people.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And Tibet is this
amazing culture,

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:46.750 align:middle line:90%
which is the child of India.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's up there on
the crown of India.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:90%
It's over the Himalaya.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And when India was
hard-pressed at the end

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
of the first millennium
with foreign invasions--

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.560 align:middle line:84%
the first really major organized
foreign invasions into India--

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.400 align:middle line:84%
then this knowledge
tradition, a lot of it

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:84%
ran up there over the
Himalayas into Tibet.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So it really is totally
connected to India,

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever anybody says--
political people.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one place
where culture, therefore,

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.790 align:middle line:84%
talks of death as a
natural liberation.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:24.005 align:middle line:84%
And how can we fear death when
there is only infinite life?

00:46:24.005 --> 00:46:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, the "Book
of Natural Liberation"--

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
which is what the real name
of the Tibetan so-called "Book

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead" is-- it's the
"Book of Natural Liberation"

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:84%
through learning in
the between state.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the minute we
die, we are totally

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:90%
aware of our virtual reality.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:90%
We are a dream body.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.690 align:middle line:90%
We are a Maya body.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore what you hear
at that time-- imagine--

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:84%
when you die, by the way,
you should have Deepak turned

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.920 align:middle line:90%
on on the video player--

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:84%
--because the first
thing you're going

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.540 align:middle line:84%
to know-- you're going to be
listening to the same people,

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but then your body mind
will really be a mind body.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.590 align:middle line:90%
A [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The minute you're
dead, this thing

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
will be lying
there-- this wetware.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.650 align:middle line:84%
All the wetware will be
lying there, like ugh.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be there, and you'll
be wondering, who is that?

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be there.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And then if Deepak
is on the video,

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:25.870 align:middle line:84%
he'll be saying, bring
those neuropeptides

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:90%
into oneness with Brahma.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And you will experience that
immediately because you'll

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:84%
totally-- whatever you
experience in this totally

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.940 align:middle line:84%
fluid manmade body has no
resistance from a concrete body

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.650 align:middle line:84%
filled with fight-and-flight
syndromes and all

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of these instinctual
reaction patterns.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're nine times more
intelligent, they say in Tibet,

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:90%
the minute you're dead.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Can I give the conceptual--

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Please.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>--map for different
states of consciousness

00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Please.

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>--and see what
the parallels are?

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Because there are--

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>I hope you can.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] are.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Please do.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.035 align:middle line:90%
Please do.

00:48:06.035 --> 00:48:06.835 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:48:06.835 --> 00:48:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So the way Vedanta
describes all of reality

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.330 align:middle line:84%
is a projection of which state
of consciousness you're in.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the state
of consciousness you're in,

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you project a certain
kind of reality.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The first state of
consciousness is deep sleep.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And in deep sleep, you also
have a certain reality.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a limited
degree of awareness.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If I come and scream at
you, I say there's a fire on

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:37.170 align:middle line:84%
or your child is crying and
you happen to be the mother,

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.050 align:middle line:84%
then you immediately
respond to that,

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.950 align:middle line:84%
which means that your
spirit is in surveillance

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:90%
even in deep sleep.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit creates its own
physiology for that moment.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has
experienced that.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:90%
No need to belabor the point.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The second state of
consciousness is dreams.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Now what we have is a little
more repertoire of experience

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and our brain is functioning
a little differently.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.700 align:middle line:84%
There are stories that are being
weaved by the karmic software.

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
dreaming, it's very real.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
No one can convince us
that this is not real.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It's only after we wake
up that we look back

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, that was
an interesting dream.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The insight that it
was a dream happens

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.750 align:middle line:84%
after you wake up
from the dream,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.110 align:middle line:84%
not in the dream-- unless
you're a lucid dreamer, which

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is a whole different
thing which we don't

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about right now.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But the insight that
that was a dream only

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:42.051 align:middle line:84%
occurs after you wake
up from the dream.

00:49:42.051 --> 00:49:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Now Vedanta says when you
wake up from that dream,

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.920 align:middle line:90%
you wake up into another dream.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And that other dream
is what you call

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:90%
waking state of consciousness.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.428 align:middle line:84%
Presumably you're at
least in that right now.

00:50:00.428 --> 00:50:01.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in that waking
state of consciousness,

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:84%
then you're participating
in it just like you

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.760 align:middle line:84%
were participating in the
dream and you don't know

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:90%
that it's equally ephemeral.

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:19.400 align:middle line:90%
It's equally transitory.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It's equally insubstantial.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.769 align:middle line:90%
It's equally illusionary.

00:50:24.769 --> 00:50:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, of
course, you get caught up

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.160 align:middle line:84%
in the melodrama
and the hysteria

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety of the dream
because you think it's real.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And you will remain in it
until you wake up from it.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And then after you
wake up from it,

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:84%
then you'll have
the insight, aha,

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.150 align:middle line:84%
what an interesting
state that was.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we have different
words, bardos and so on.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But here we wake up
from the waking state

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.920 align:middle line:84%
into what Vedanta calls the
fourth state of consciousness.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.390 align:middle line:84%
The fourth state
of consciousness

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:03.500 align:middle line:84%
when you have a first
glimpse of your soul.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:84%
People, when they had that, it's
been very dramatic for them.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Sir Walt Whitman
says, I must not

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:84%
be awake for
everything looks to me

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:84%
as it never did before
or else I'm awake

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and all that
was before was just a dream.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Gautama Buddha himself--
this lifetime of ours

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is as transient
as autumn clouds.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.300 align:middle line:84%
To watch the birth
and death of beings

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.650 align:middle line:84%
is like looking at the
movements of a dance.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.070 align:middle line:84%
A lifetime is like
a flash of lightning

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.190 align:middle line:84%
in the sky rushing
by like a torrent

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.830 align:middle line:90%
down the steep mountain.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm awake-- which is
the meaning of the word buddha.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:84%
He's asked at the moment of
his death, are you a prophet?

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Are you the messiah?

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.280 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%
He says, who are you?

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm awake.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.180 align:middle line:90%
That's all he says.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the meaning of the word
buddha-- the awakened one.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Waking up from the
insubstantial reality,

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.490 align:middle line:90%
into glimpsing the soul.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.456 align:middle line:84%
So actually we could try
something right now with you.

00:52:08.456 --> 00:52:11.100 align:middle line:84%
You could glimpse
it even this moment.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:84%
As you're listening to me,
just turn your attention

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.768 align:middle line:90%
to who's listening.

00:52:14.768 --> 00:52:18.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So as you're listening to
me, just turn your attention

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:90%
to who's listening.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:25.110 align:middle line:90%
There's a presence there.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not your mind.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is still noisy.

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Just turn your attention
to who's listening.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And that silent witness--
that ever-present witnessing

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.010 align:middle line:90%
awareness-- is the soul.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And once we start
glimpsing it, then we

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:84%
start to peel the
layers of that.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that ever-present
witnessing awareness

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:48.425 align:middle line:84%
is there even in deep sleep,
even in dreams, and even

00:52:48.425 --> 00:52:49.225 align:middle line:90%
in wakefulness.

00:52:49.225 --> 00:52:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So the experience that Bob
was saying, you're dying

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and you see the body out
there and you can witness it,

00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:01.340 align:middle line:84%
well, both Buddha and Vedanta
say, you can do that now.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to wait
until the moment of death.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you enter that now,
you will not fear death.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the unknown then will
be known to you, as Tagore says.

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And when the unknown is
known, what's there to fear?

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.570 align:middle line:84%
To have that ever-present
witnessing awareness in sleeps,

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:23.310 align:middle line:84%
in dreams, in waking state,
is to suddenly wake up

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.040 align:middle line:90%
to the full reality of the soul.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:84%
In Vedantic traditions it's
called cosmic consciousness.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the fifth state of
consciousness, the fourth being

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.220 align:middle line:90%
just glimpsing the soul.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that,
what Vedanta describes

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.750 align:middle line:84%
as the sixth state
of consciousness

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:84%
where the ever-present
witnessing awareness becomes

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:45.940 align:middle line:84%
obvious to you cognitively
and perceptually even

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.880 align:middle line:84%
in the objects of
your perception.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So you look at that
tree and you say, yes.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists
have this technique.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:84%
You look at that tree,
and you look long enough

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:84%
in that special state
of meditative awareness,

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and you see there's a tree
there but there are also

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
rainbows and sunshine and earth
and water and wind and space

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite void and the
whole history of the universe

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.710 align:middle line:90%
right there in that tree.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.222 align:middle line:84%
And you go beyond that and
you see there's a spirit,

00:54:13.222 --> 00:54:14.680 align:middle line:84%
there's a soul,
there's a presence,

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:84%
there's an ever-present
witnessing awareness

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.290 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the sixth
state of consciousness.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And then a time comes when
the ever-present witnessing

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.530 align:middle line:84%
awareness here in the
subject of perception

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and there in the
object of perception

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.720 align:middle line:90%
is actually the same presence.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing was a perceptual
artifact to begin with.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's only one witness,
and the whole universe

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:40.540 align:middle line:90%
is an expression of that.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is what Buddha
calls enlightenment.

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>And it's not that
difficult to understand.

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You can actually map out these
different states of awareness

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and soon hopefully have
the research grants

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to look at how the
brain functions

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.580 align:middle line:84%
in these different
states of awareness.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So that people really
for the first time

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:09.300 align:middle line:84%
feel that this is not mere
esoteric Eastern philosophical

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:14.170 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical speculation that
occurred in the consciousness

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:90%
of some enlightened beings.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
the same hardware,

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.200 align:middle line:90%
the same nervous system.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And what was possible for
Buddha, he himself says

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:25.200 align:middle line:90%
is possible for you.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.420 align:middle line:90%
We are the Bodhisattvas.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>And that sure
generates, Deepak, I

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:37.680 align:middle line:84%
call it Depanta, not Vedanta,
not Buddhanta, Depanta.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>No!

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Depanta.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:90%
That is Depanta.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I say
it's a renaissance.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, India is the
mother where people

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:84%
were less harassed, who
asserted their ability

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to know their own reality.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason there
were more of them.

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:57.056 align:middle line:84%
There were plenty of them
in the Mediterranean, too,

00:55:57.056 --> 00:55:58.850 align:middle line:84%
but then some tyrant
would arrest them.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Even Socrates, what
did they give Socrates?

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:06.520 align:middle line:84%
We call it a hemlock
milkshake around campuses.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not too healthy.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fruit shake.

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they wiped them
out in other places

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:16.330 align:middle line:84%
because the authority wanted
everybody just not feeling

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that they know everything.

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:18.520 align:middle line:84%
They wanted everybody
just working.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.090 align:middle line:90%
They wanted them obeying orders.

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So it happened everywhere.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But what we have to
have on the planet

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.440 align:middle line:84%
now-- secularism
and the pretensions

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:84%
of materialistic science are
not really believed broadly

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:37.000 align:middle line:90%
on the planet anymore.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.520 align:middle line:84%
What people call
fundamentalism--

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.450 align:middle line:84%
which exists in Hinduism,
in Islam, in Christianity,

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:44.990 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism, in every one
of the world religions now,

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Eastern Orthodoxy-- it's
asserting itself very

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.790 align:middle line:90%
powerfully again in the world.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And that trend will continue.

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
disillusionment in the promises

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of the great secular
materialist age.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going to save everybody.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to
have a stainless steel

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:03.580 align:middle line:84%
pacemaker and a new brain that
they're going to make in some--

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.301 align:middle line:84%
and IBM is going
to-- Bill Gates is

00:57:05.301 --> 00:57:06.800 align:middle line:84%
going to come and
live in your brain

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.335 align:middle line:90%
and make everything work well.

00:57:08.335 --> 00:57:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha ha.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And people are really giving
that up on the planet.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But then if spirituality
returns in this old way

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.850 align:middle line:84%
where people are
content and where

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a few mystics
who are allowed to know

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.054 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else is supposed
to just believe and obey.

00:57:26.054 --> 00:57:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
have a vengeful god

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.500 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to have
this kind of jealous god

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.666 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to have
that kind who's going to go

00:57:31.666 --> 00:57:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and say kill the unbelievers.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
absolute chaos.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.400 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
anthrax Crusades.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.810 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be nuclear
religious wars and things.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:44.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just totally impossible.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So there should
be now a Manhattan

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Project of the spirit, a
Manhattan Project of the mind.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:84%
If anybody had any brains
today, they would be doing that.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But my point is this
is a national priority

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.241 align:middle line:84%
because people go, oh
well-- Do you really

00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:05.490 align:middle line:90%
think people could understand?

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:06.500 align:middle line:90%
No, no, never.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.730 align:middle line:90%
They'll never understand.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.039 align:middle line:84%
No, no, Jerry Falwell is
going to always be an idiot.

00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Or else he's going to be
great and the rest of us

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.880 align:middle line:90%
will be Satan.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Hopeless polarization is coming.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, the
new religious wars

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to make the old
ones seem like a tea party.

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear tipped crusaders
running around like la-di-da.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
really terrible.

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:36.530 align:middle line:84%
The only solution is
to take our ingenuity,

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to take our technologies,
to take our information age

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and make it where
Buddha is on satellite.

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:90%
We have Academy Awards.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:49.720 align:middle line:84%
We have enlightenment
awards, and a billion people

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.980 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously can meditate on
recognizing the self in others.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.780 align:middle line:90%
No, really.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And they can do that.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:90%
People definitely can do that.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I know some Tibetans
who don't know much.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.930 align:middle line:84%
They can chase their
yaks around a field.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a great
deal of knowledge.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.170 align:middle line:90%
They have Bhakti.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But they have been
steeping themselves

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.560 align:middle line:84%
in a culture that understands
the connection of knowledge

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and love and understands that--
through their theory of karma,

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.700 align:middle line:84%
of course, and reincarnation--
that we have all

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.920 align:middle line:84%
been reborn infinitely--
intertwined, all of us.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We've all been lovers.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.584 align:middle line:90%
Even the guys.

00:59:28.584 --> 00:59:29.500 align:middle line:90%
We've all been lovers.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We've all been
parents and children.

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We've all been enemies, too,
but we won't be mentioning that.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.810 align:middle line:84%
We've all had all different
kinds of problems,

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:38.950 align:middle line:84%
but we've been
infinitely intertwined.

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So when this kind of toothless
Tibetan today out there

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.350 align:middle line:84%
with their yak, knowing
very little, looks at you,

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:49.690 align:middle line:84%
you feel that they see
the kinship in you.

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that is needed.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So that when your wild, crazy
Muslim fundamentalist looks

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:59.730 align:middle line:84%
at your wild, crazy
Lynchburg, Virginia Protestant

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.590 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalist, the two
are looking at each other

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:07.740 align:middle line:84%
with their each notion of a
triumphal nuclear-tipped god.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet they look beyond
that and they see kin.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.010 align:middle line:84%
They see this one guy wearing
pajamas and this other guy

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.750 align:middle line:84%
wearing his little puffy
suit, that they're kin.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Then they won't kill each other.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The change in consciousness
that is planet-saving for our--

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
when you say maya,
I always think

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:31.500 align:middle line:90%
my grandchild's name is Maya.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I can't help it.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
When I think of
Maya projecting, I'm

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
thinking of my little
Maya grandchild

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
who is so cute, such
a gentle projection.

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Of Brahman.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>>At the moment.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Of Brahman.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>At the moment.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Of Brahman, exactly.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But what are we doing with
children and grandchildren

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and whatever if we're not going
to take the fate of this planet

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.070 align:middle line:90%
seriously?

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And how can we
condemn this planet

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to a bunch of fanatics with
nuclear weapons and germ

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.470 align:middle line:90%
weapons?

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I won't get into it, but the
germ business from Russia

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
spreading everywhere through
Asia and the Middle East,

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.110 align:middle line:90%
it's truly terrifying actually.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Truly terrifying.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm very into this Sri-- second
renaissance-- the goddess Sri.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that Vishnu's consort?

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think in order to make
that happen, we must not

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
create the schism that
currently exists between science

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Because that is the
divide right now--

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
either you're a scientist or
you are a spiritual being,

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and the two have nothing
to do with each other.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Mystical poets, et
cetera, have had insights

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.945 align:middle line:84%
without going into the
science or the logic of it.

01:01:58.945 --> 01:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So there's a poem.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Again, Rumi-- from the 12th
century-- in one of his poems,

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
he says, "I have lived
on the lip of insanity,

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know reasons,
knocking at the door.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
The door opens.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been knocking
from the inside."

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Now we all get that immediately.

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But now what the
scientists are also

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
saying-- at least
in quantum physics--

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is that the cosmologist
who studies the cosmos

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.420 align:middle line:90%
is an expression of the cosmos.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The physicist who studies
the laws of physics

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is an expression of
those laws of physics.

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's no such thing
as objective science.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's all subject,
object, process

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of interaction, as you said,
woven together-- inextricably

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
woven together.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Science has to change.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The way science is
done has to change.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is changing slowly--

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Slowly.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>--but then there's
all this resistance

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
because they're indulged in
being the great authority.

01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the Buddhists
have a saying, Deepak,

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that the Dalai Lama often
says in his dialogues

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
with the scientists, but he
never says it too loudly.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that they've
quite heard yet-- some,

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
but quite.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there's
three levels of relativity

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
from Buddha's
teaching-- three levels.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the first level
of relativity,

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the coarsest one,
is where Buddhism and science

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
completely meet but
with a different focus--

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists toward the interior
as more important-- not

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
exclusively important.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The exterior is also important--
medicine and biology all

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that is important-- but the
interior is more important.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
That's cause and
effect-- causality.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's the first level.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And there there's
attunement, and there

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.341 align:middle line:90%
can be a lot of dialogue.

01:03:34.341 --> 01:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The second level is the
level of part and whole

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.099 align:middle line:84%
and analyzing the thing in
terms of parts and wholes.

01:03:40.099 --> 01:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's a more subtle level.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.306 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, however--
with the subatomic

01:03:44.306 --> 01:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and the microdimension
and everything--

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
there's also parity there and
there's interconnectedness

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:49.110 align:middle line:90%
with science.

01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Beautifully.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>The third level is the
level of word and referent,

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
or concept designation
and designated,

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
where the mind is
involved through the word,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.522 align:middle line:90%
through [NON-ENGLISH]

01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Because there's nothing
that exists for which

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.210 align:middle line:90%
you don't have a word.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.469 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the word is
co-creative with the things

01:04:11.469 --> 01:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
so that subject and object
interconnect with name

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
and form, as they say.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you take Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and you say that the
subjectivity is, in fact,

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
warping the objectivity
in observing it,

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that destroys the notion of
the privileged observer who

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
observes reality, quote
unquote, "objectively," not

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
being a participant
in reality, which

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
was the Western
exaggeration in the attempt

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.010 align:middle line:90%
to escape from the church.

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I hope everybody gets this
because it's very important

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.640 align:middle line:90%
what he's saying just now.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.169 align:middle line:90%
>>So they have that Heisenberg.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
think the language

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
is mathematics,
which is, of course,

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.468 align:middle line:84%
a brilliant and
wonderful language.

01:04:45.468 --> 01:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%
But it's even ordinary words.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's mantra is what it is.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.025 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate scientific
use of language

01:04:50.025 --> 01:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
is-- and poetic, where science
and poetry meet-- is mantra.

01:04:53.930 --> 01:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, [NON-ENGLISH] And
this mantra is where word is

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
co-creative with form and with
life and with vibrancy and with

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.980 align:middle line:90%
liberation and so forth.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.376 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it all is
now and then quietly says

01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of these dialogues
where the great scientists are

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.249 align:middle line:84%
talking about all their great
technology, he's saying,

01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
we're waiting to talk there
on that level of relativity

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
where people are responsible
for their mind's engagement

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and creative engagement
with reality.

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:27.710 align:middle line:84%
What Deepak calls where
the creative level

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
of God, the creator--
sixth level,

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.175 align:middle line:90%
I hope-- I am getting it right?

01:05:31.175 --> 01:05:31.975 align:middle line:90%
Sixth or fifth.

01:05:31.975 --> 01:05:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Fifth.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Fifth, yeah.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Fifth level.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
You see, I'm not that
well-schooled yet.

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Fifth level of God where the
individual takes responsibility

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.706 align:middle line:84%
of co-creating
with God the world,

01:05:41.706 --> 01:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
which does not just mean
that you're some big deal.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It means you better be careful
what you think, what you say,

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.130 align:middle line:90%
because it creates.

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It's divine.

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.823 align:middle line:90%
>>What you said is so important.

01:05:53.823 --> 01:05:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Can I--

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Please.

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>--explain?

01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The concept that Bob has just
expressed of co-creation--

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
see, there's
constantly this, again,

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
antagonism between
the materialists, who

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
say that matter causes the
subjective experience--

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
so I look out there and
everything out there

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
causes me to have a
subjective experience.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
The materialists say that.

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Other people say, no,
it's like-- what's

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.252 align:middle line:90%
his name-- Bishop.

01:06:27.252 --> 01:06:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you know who I'm talking--

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:31.848 align:middle line:84%
>>He says, no, it's
the other way around.

01:06:31.848 --> 01:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness projects itself
as the material universe.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And what Buddhism says
is you're both wrong.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We are interbeings that
arise in the inter-isness

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and we're constantly
co-creating each other out

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.370 align:middle line:90%
of that inter-isness.

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And what physics calls that
now is a tangled hierarchy.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
A tangled hierarchy
is something that you

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
can't get out of it
because the tangle is

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.060 align:middle line:90%
infinitely interwoven.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So to make it
simple-- in grammar,

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
a tangled hierarchy would
be the following sentence--

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:11.560 align:middle line:90%
I am a liar.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
See, the subject qualifies the
predicate and the predicate

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.140 align:middle line:90%
qualifies the subject.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
If I say, I am a liar,
then if I'm lying,

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling the truth.

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm telling the
truth, I must be lying.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:26.070 align:middle line:90%
So what am I?

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Am I truthful or am I a liar?

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a tangled
hierarchy in grammar.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot get out of the
tangled hierarchy while you

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.710 align:middle line:90%
stay in it.

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The only way to get out
of the tangled hierarchy

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
is to jump out of the system--
to transcend the system.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
in grammar, you

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
would say, who's making that
statement-- I am a liar?

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And the one who's
making that statement

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
has the potential for both
lying and telling the truth.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So you understand what
a tangled hierarchy is?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Now in physics,
tangled hierarchy

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
says that the
subject of experience

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and the object of
experience co-arise

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously moment by moment
from a transcendent domain

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
which is beyond space and time.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's who you are.

01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:18.149 align:middle line:84%
You are neither the
subject nor the object

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:21.689 align:middle line:84%
nor the process of interaction
between subject and object,

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:23.883 align:middle line:84%
but the potential
for the whole thing--

01:08:23.883 --> 01:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
for the subject, the object,
and the process of interaction.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
This is very Vedantic
and very, very much--

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.496 align:middle line:90%
>>Depantic.

01:08:31.496 --> 01:08:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Depantic.

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>--Buddhism.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:37.194 align:middle line:84%
>>This is where Buddhantic
and Vedantic I think

01:08:37.194 --> 01:08:39.540 align:middle line:90%
are very mutually reinforcing.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.359 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine yourself now--
just for a moment-- suddenly

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
experiencing-- don't
think that, oh,

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.928 align:middle line:84%
enlightenment, some other
day, some other life,

01:08:47.928 --> 01:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
some other time.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself experiencing
being all the other people

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously with
yourself, entangled in that.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.336 align:middle line:84%
Imagine everyone thinks, oh,
Buddha is blissful, therefore,

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't have to
worry about Buddha.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So they would never
want to imagine.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Although they say Buddha is
blissful, but imagine how

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:middle line:90%
blissfully frustrated he is.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Because he suddenly has
an experience-- or she--

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:18.609 align:middle line:84%
there are Ms. Buddhas and Mrs.
Buddhas and Ms. Buddhas both--

01:09:18.609 --> 01:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and has this experience
that suddenly--

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine yourself right now.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
You suddenly imagine
that you're going ahead

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
feeling like you're
you-- enclosed

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
within your
subjectivity [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:35.760 align:middle line:84%
coming into your sense thing
and to your subjectivity.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
suddenly to your amazement--

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
on the lip of insanity--
you are perceiving yourself

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
as everybody else, too,
and yet you're blissful.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:52.359 align:middle line:84%
You have that expansion because
of a feeling of intense bliss.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
You experience all
reality as intense bliss.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Now you look over
there, and you find

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to look too far--
of course no one in this room,

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.414 align:middle line:84%
so it will be hard
to imagine here--

01:10:01.414 --> 01:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
to look too far

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see somebody
with a really grim look

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
on their face, real
furrowed brow, deep headache

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and suffering and misery.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're experiencing every
cell in their being as a bliss,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and they have caught themselves
up in the theater of torment.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.978 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't got enough
and they're mad at somebody

01:10:22.978 --> 01:10:25.394 align:middle line:84%
and they're wronged by somebody
and they're deeply wounded

01:10:25.394 --> 01:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, can't do
it, and it's all after them.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing this person
creating hell for themself.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And you see every synapse
and cell and neuropeptide

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.785 align:middle line:84%
within that as bliss, and yet
you can't just bliss them out

01:10:40.785 --> 01:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
of it, because they perceive
your energy-- flowing

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to them as a bliss-- they
perceive it as more pressure,

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and then they fold that into
their theater of torment.

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
This is compassion.

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to put on
some sort of a theater.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to think of
how to distract them.

01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:00.705 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey-- it's like a
kid who's having a tantrum.

01:11:00.705 --> 01:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to like--
oh, look, there's

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Mickey Mouse or something
so that they forget

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.750 align:middle line:90%
they're having the tantrum.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha and God
together are thinking

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of one theatrical
performance after another

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to distract people from turning
their own deeply innate nature

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of bliss into some sort
of theater of torment.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
compassion, non-duality

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
becomes dynamic activity.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is why-- [SANSKRIT]--
explodes with 1,000 arms.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Those 1,000 arms are not
just some freaky thing,

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
like some kind of weird
millipede or milli-hand.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Those 1,000 arms
symbolize that his heart

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is exploding into reaching
into all of the beings' hearts

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and lives, trying to do
something to cheer them up,

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.780 align:middle line:90%
pat them on the back.

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And not to be
clumsy in doing it,

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:54.490 align:middle line:84%
each hand has a sensitive
eye in the palm.

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So he sees exactly--
like a bionic robot

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
seeing in every direction,
reaching into all these lives.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>The 1,000 arms of compassion.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>1,000 arms of compassion.

01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:05.296 align:middle line:90%
That is what the thing means.

01:12:05.296 --> 01:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So now think of that 1,000 arms.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Think of your 1,000 arms as
you empathize with all beings.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Your bliss flows beyond being
encased within your skin.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And your bliss becomes the field
awareness of an enlightened

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
being that enfolds
other lives within it,

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and yet doesn't take them over.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not body snatching.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not taking away their life.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just peeling every element
of their life, like a CAT scan,

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and letting them have the life.

01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But then not just letting them
suffer it through-- helping

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:37.693 align:middle line:84%
encourage them to figure
out how to enjoy it.

01:12:37.693 --> 01:12:41.407 align:middle line:90%


01:12:41.407 --> 01:12:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Any comments or questions?

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%


01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>West and East and
science and religion

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
have been tangoing
for millennia,

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like it
may be coalescing.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And the individual vision
of unity is always present.

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Is there a collective
possibility of this occurring?

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>I think there is.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, why
now, and why never before?

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:12.268 align:middle line:90%


01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Bob painted a beautiful
picture of the ancient Indian

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
civilization-- and
it is beautiful--

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
but I have to say
that we're still

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
talking about an eclectic group
of luminaries in ancient India.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.165 align:middle line:84%
>>The majority of Indians
were barbarians and still are.

01:13:28.165 --> 01:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Much though, you know.

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure, sure.

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:32.725 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

01:13:32.725 --> 01:13:32.800 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's true of the
majority of humanity.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
When we think of ancient
Greece, we think of Parmenides,

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
we think of Socrates,
we think of Plato,

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
we think of Pythagoras, and we
say, aha, Greek civilization.

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But look at what the majority
of Greeks were doing.

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
They were throwing handicapped
children to the lions.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
They were sexist.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.610 align:middle line:90%
They believed in slavery.

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot say
any civilization has

01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
the prerogative or the
privilege for enlightenment,

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
not even India, with
all due respect.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Indian.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no, absolutely.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>And so we've never
had a golden age.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Never.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
There has never
been a renaissance.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
The history of human
beings has been the history

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
of torment and suffering.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So why is there room
for optimism now?

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:27.092 align:middle line:84%
The room for optimism is, A,
because science is catching on.

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Science is a wonderful thing.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It can give us monstrosities,
but it can also

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.500 align:middle line:90%
create amazing benefits for us.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And the same science that we
can use to destroy the world,

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
we can create a new age
of real renaissance.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
I say there is hope

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
today is because we
have the internet.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
We have media.

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And what is a good idea can
collectively, immediately,

01:14:55.630 --> 01:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
saturate a critical threshold
in collective consciousness.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.240 align:middle line:84%
If an idea is appealing,
you cannot stop it.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.920 align:middle line:90%
You cannot stop it.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of a collective
enlightenment is now being

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.090 align:middle line:90%
born, and it cannot be stopped.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like a child that comes
out of the womb cannot go back

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.320 align:middle line:90%
to the womb.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:26.702 align:middle line:84%
The idea is born, and with our
technology it will manifest.

01:15:26.702 --> 01:15:27.654 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

01:15:27.654 --> 01:15:29.560 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I also think,
personally-- because I

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:38.342 align:middle line:84%
locate barbarianhood
right here-- Bob Redneck.

01:15:38.342 --> 01:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Raw redneck buddhantic.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And barbarism is
here also, mixed.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to
perfection at all.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But I count myself lucky
at the blessing of maya,

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.320 align:middle line:90%
at seeing maya in the creative.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I think God and Brahma
and Indra and Buddha

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and all the bodhisattvas
and all the goddesses

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and the female buddhas
and so forth-- I

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
think they've
surrounded humanity.

01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Like science, for example,
being materialistic,

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to grab and cling
and misknow and make atoms.

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the atom, one
day, sort of pops up,

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's Buddha in
that atom-- and Brahma are

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.240 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the atom.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we're surrounded
by angels without realizing it.

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've created
this network of-- we

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
call it-- it's
called-- actually,

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian vision--
Indian mythology-- the jewel

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.010 align:middle line:90%
net of Indra is an expression.

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And the jewel net of
Indra is this network

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
of jewels-- that's from
ancient time in India

01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
before there was computers
and TVs and things.

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
In the [INAUDIBLE]-- there's a
city on the top of the Indian

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Olympus-- of the Indian
cosmology-- where Indra rules,

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
only a lower heaven--

01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:59.020 align:middle line:90%
way below the Brahma heavens.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But it is one kind of
real estate type heaven--

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
which is like Olympus-- they
have a really good time.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They have the best
jacuzzis-- much better

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
than Palm Springs or
Bel Air, or whatever--

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and they hang out up there.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that they
have is this jewel net of Indra.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And this jewel net
hangs over the city.

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the net is
faceted in such a way

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that when you look in
any facet of the jewels,

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.370 align:middle line:84%
you see all the other
facets of the jewels.

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a telephone system.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Holographic.

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic.

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a holographic system
that is over that city.

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And so this jewel
net of Indra is

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
hung around the whole planet.

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And we see reflected in
that all of each other's

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:39.510 align:middle line:90%
interconnections and souls.

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We've been born and
reborn, and we've

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
gone through this
agony and that agony.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's back
and nobody is lost.

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And no baby has lost
And we're all here,

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're staring and
glaring at each other.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And we've done each other in
infinite numbers of times,

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.160 align:middle line:90%
and we're sick of it.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.716 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid since the Cold War.

01:18:01.716 --> 01:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, they always
congratulate themselves

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:05.170 align:middle line:90%
on mutually assured destruction.

01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But I had a vision once--
actually when I was in Almora

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
actually-- it was 1971--
Bangladesh wartime--

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
very dangerous time.

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union and
China were also fighting.

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I think some people did
press some buttons actually.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.280 align:middle line:90%
There were some buttons pressed.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But I saw different
angelic beings.

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It was just an Almora vision,
but these very angelic beings

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.240 align:middle line:84%
just jammed all
of the computers.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.340 align:middle line:90%
They totally just jammed it all.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.890 align:middle line:90%
No signals were transmitted.

01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing flew.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, I began
to become a little, tiny bit

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
religious, which
I'm basically like

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:45.260 align:middle line:90%
a hard grained intellectual.

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.560 align:middle line:90%
But I really did see that.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think we do have this
kind of angelic protection.

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We have this destiny.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
We have the synchronicity.

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.060 align:middle line:90%
This is going to happen now.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
happen now, because you

01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and I and Deepak are
going to make it happen.

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.436 align:middle line:84%
Because we won't
let it not happen.

01:19:03.436 --> 01:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we have our children
and our grandchildren.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.540 align:middle line:90%
What did we do that for?

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to turn over
this planet to anthrax merchants

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and things, what's the point?

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
We are going to see to it.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
nurturing beings around us

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that are going to help it out
because we're so incredibly

01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.025 align:middle line:90%
incompetent.

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:23.960 align:middle line:90%
At least I am.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>And remember, the nurturing
beings are actually, again,

01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.070 align:middle line:90%
aspects of ourselves.

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Of course.

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>The angels.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Rumi says, when I die, I
shall soar with angels.

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I die as an angel,
what I shall become you cannot

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:40.240 align:middle line:90%
imagine.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I think Rumi inspired Roosevelt
actually, who of course said,

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
to fear but fear.

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
With fear we will
destroy ourselves.

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But with love, realizing that if
we even let go of everything--

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
if you die and you're
embraced by love,

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.793 align:middle line:90%
how can you fear death?

01:20:01.793 --> 01:20:05.180 align:middle line:90%


01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.882 align:middle line:90%
If we insist upon that.

01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:13.030 align:middle line:90%


01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>I was thinking,
as you were talking,

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
about the spiritual influx--
the Eastern influence--

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that we got gradually
in America from India

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and from the East in general.

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And primarily it was
happening around about the 60s

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.130 align:middle line:90%
as a great accentuation.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was the period
of the use of drugs.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I am not involved
in the use of drugs,

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.530 align:middle line:84%
but I have a great deal
of curiosity about it

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that we have
this-- I think to myself.

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I meditate, and I have
this heavy, heavy, heavy

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:53.015 align:middle line:84%
encrustation that I can't seem
to break through in a way.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I think you know
what I'm saying.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do we get there?

01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we get there
in this lifetime?

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
How do I get rid of this
wall to get to reality?

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
For many people--
and, by the way,

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the '60s generation
has not disappeared.

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.816 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting here right now.

01:21:14.816 --> 01:21:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it never went away.

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting right
in front of you.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
We are that generation, so
it never really did go away.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:30.750 align:middle line:84%
That was a sudden appearance
and it has continued to grow.

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The media took
away the attention,

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and now the media is
bringing back the attention.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But we were never satisfied
with the status quo.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was the Vietnam--
the anti-war movement,

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it was ecology,
whether it was feminism.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.850 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones who started it.

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
A proud generation that is
now reaching its maturity.

01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:57.625 align:middle line:84%
That was our adolescence,
that was our puberty,

01:21:57.625 --> 01:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and now we are reaching our
maturity, or we think we are.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm over the hill.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.815 align:middle line:90%
>>No, you're not, sir.

01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you when
you get there.

01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, doc.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>So it has never gone away.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The drug experience for many
was a dramatic experience

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state
of consciousness.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's true for many
spiritual traditions

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
where they use drugs to
immediately-- whether it's

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
peyote or whether it's
mushrooms or whatever--

01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to immediately cause a shift--
as Carlos Castaneda would say--

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
in the assemblage point--
where you assemble

01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
the universe in consciousness.

01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But to stay with that experience
causes a lot of disintegration.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.220 align:middle line:90%
You can have an experience.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And if it is dramatic
and sudden and radical,

01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
there's a thin line between
sages and psychotics

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.330 align:middle line:90%
and geniuses.

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.998 align:middle line:84%
It's a motley group of sages
and psychotics as well.

01:22:51.998 --> 01:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would caution that the
drug experience is not the way

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to go for anyone, even
though for many-- including,

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the
Beatles and many others--

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.785 align:middle line:90%
it was their first insight.

01:23:04.785 --> 01:23:05.585 align:middle line:90%
>>The catalyst.

01:23:05.585 --> 01:23:06.435 align:middle line:90%
>>The catalyst.

01:23:06.435 --> 01:23:07.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the way to go.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I would like just to add
about the breaking through

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.690 align:middle line:90%
is take a break.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't push so hard sometimes.

01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing about
Vedanta, about Buddhanta,

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is that-- and the
difference between that

01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and some other kinds
of ideas of reality--

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason Buddha was
happy-- the reason he smiles--

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is that what he saw is that
it is your actual nature

01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:38.201 align:middle line:84%
to be happy, to be
free, to be released.

01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:40.117 align:middle line:84%
It is not that you have
to create it and break

01:23:40.117 --> 01:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
through something
to get it elsewhere.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.780 align:middle line:90%
It is actually your nature.

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes trying too
hard to get something

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that you conceive
of as a freedom

01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and misconceptualizing your
actual state as a bondage

01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:56.050 align:middle line:90%
can be overexaggerated.

01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And one can just
relax a little bit.

01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:02.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama always says--
I think very rightly-- that we

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
mustn't try too hard and set
too high an image of what we're

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to because
it's actually a trick of how

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.040 align:middle line:90%
to defeat our positive outlook.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Just a tiny little bit.

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We get a little bit.

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Drop by drop, we
fill the bucket.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Step by step, we cross the
forest, we cross the desert.

01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:28.712 align:middle line:84%
We don't try to
run the whole time

01:24:28.712 --> 01:24:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and then collapse and then
feel that it's impossible,

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.870 align:middle line:90%
if you follow me.

01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel too much pressure
and too much frustration

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
about trying to break
through, take a break.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Take a break.

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Take a break.

01:24:40.890 --> 01:24:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Meditate two minutes a day only.

01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't meditate a half an hour.

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And actually one
of the tricks is

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to quit when you're
still enjoying it.

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Deny it to yourself.

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't hog up the end
when you're collapsing.

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:55.419 align:middle line:90%
I got to make 30 minutes.

01:24:55.419 --> 01:24:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I got to keep meditating.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.136 align:middle line:84%
Then you won't want
to meditate again.

01:24:58.136 --> 01:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Within your first two
minutes and you're like zing,

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.960 align:middle line:90%
then stop.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you can't wait
to get back to it.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Play tricks on yourself.

01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:07.610 align:middle line:90%
And have fun and take a break.

01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you, Deepak--

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a privilege.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a privilege
to be with you.

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.560 align:middle line:84%
