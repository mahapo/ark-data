00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%

to be living many longer years,

a gentle birth rather than

a disaster catastrophe birth--

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to change--

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the degree to

in consciousness.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
That's part A. Part
B is to inform people

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
what conscious evolution--
what it would look

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
like if we consciously chose
to evolve rather than wait

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
for biology to take
its time, when there

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:90%

>> From what the
scientific evidence is,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
we cannot keep over-growing
in the finite womb and heating

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
our climate, and
expect our civilisation

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and our environment to survive.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Barbara is seen as the
mother of the entire field

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:10%
of conscious evolution.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.182 align:middle line:10%
>> Not just the mother of it,
but the grandmother of it.

00:04:57.182 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:10%
>> You can find that idea going
all the way back a century,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:10%
if not more.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:10%
But something about that
phrase, conscious evolution,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:10%
kind of captured it in a very
simple, understandable way.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:10%
When Most people think
about the word evolution,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:10%
they think about Darwin
and natural selection

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:10%
and random mutation and
neo-darwinism and genetics

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:10%
and adaptation, and fitness,
and all of those things.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But conscious evolution has
more to do with development

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.455 align:middle line:90%
and evolution of human culture.

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the
idea that we can consciously

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
shape and make
choices individually

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and collectively
that can affect,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way, our future.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Barbara's message
has always been so rarefied

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:10%
and progressive that people
who needed a very practical,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:10%
grounded, linear interpretation
of things were not really sure

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:10%
what she was really saying.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%

everybody's talking about

the vision.

to to my friends.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
present it to them

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way that doesn't
sound completely

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
out there, new wave,
kind of airy-fairyness.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
But is something that's very--

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that's actually
grounded and viable.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Renee, how do you and your
peers feel about the future?

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there a sense of the
optimistic, pessimistic,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
concern?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
What's-- if you
could crystallize it?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say a resounding
ambivalence, really.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I have the naive
desire to make my time

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:90%
on Earth count for something.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.225 align:middle line:84%

is to stay true to our heart.

chosen a granddaughter

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:19.024 align:middle line:84%

that Barbara gives us, is the
ability to take a look upstream

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and see how we can be proactive.

>> So when we dropped the bomb,
that was the shift for me.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the fundamental
shift that the very power

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that we thought was good, to win
over others and be successful,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
was the very power that
could destroy the world.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So that shifted me
into the question

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:90%

to if not destroy
ourselves, really

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.360 align:middle line:10%

the meaning of all our new

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and technology, that's good?

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And what are images
of the future

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.165 align:middle line:84%
equal to this power that
we want to move toward?

00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I found the church didn't know.

Bryn Mawr College didn't know.

It was 1952.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:10%
I was invited to the Oval Office
because Eisenhower was a friend

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:10%
of my father's.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:10%
I remember I was riveted
to his face and his eyes.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:10%
I said, Mr. President, I
have a question for you.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the
meaning of all our new power

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:90%
that's good?

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:90%
He paused.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
He shook his head.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:10%
He said, I have no idea.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way he said it was
momentous because I knew then,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Barbara made
a determination--

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:10%
I will be the one to
know if nobody else does.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.731 align:middle line:84%
I will not let this
question go unanswered.

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think it's not unlike
what happened to the founding

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:10%
who saw themselves as in this

to the point of
committing high treason.

In their case, what
was burrowing into

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
them was this new ideal
the world had never

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
seen for a different
kind of freedom,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
for a new thing
called democracy.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:84%
For Barbara, it was to have
a new kind of thinking,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
a break with the past, where
the thinking of the past

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
couldn't begin to explain the
present, let alone the future.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So for Barbara, it started her
on a kind of an internal quest,

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was both intellectual
and ultimately emotional.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:10%
>> She wanted the message--

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:10%
not her message, but the message
that she was bringing forward

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:10%
to be a household
word, to be something

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:10%
that everyone in the world could
relate to as their mainstream

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:10%
reality.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Conscious evolution is
happening in the sense that we

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
are aware we are affecting our
own evolution by the cars we

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
drive, the babies we
have, the food we eat.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And we hear that we could be
destroying our own life support

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
system, so we're
becoming conscious

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're affecting
our own evolution,

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:90%
even if in a negative way.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
So that is not going to go away.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Barbara grows out of
the human potential movement,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:10%
which is everywhere, and
meditation, mindfulness--

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:10%
it's on the cover
of "Time" magazine.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.176 align:middle line:84%
>> You can call
it lots of things.

00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
You can call it the
conscious evolution movement.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:10%
You can call it the
human potential movement,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual but not
religious movement.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.280 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of words for it.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:10%
But I would actually call
her a New Age visionary,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.835 align:middle line:10%
and that's not a derogatory
term in my lexicon.

00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were many of
us that were moving in that

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
direction, but Barbara
was really the voice.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Barbara was the visionary.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:10%
She saw what was coming.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
She could see the
future, if you will.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> They say we'll get up to
nine or 10 billion people.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That is going to lead
to massive crises.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We've overgrown the
resources of planet Earth,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
so there's going to
be even more poverty

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and starving for awhile.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But as we get
through this, we will

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
have stabilized because
we will recognize

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're all part of
one body, that we're

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.656 align:middle line:90%
all part of one living system.

00:21:58.656 --> 00:22:00.114 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:00.114 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Hello, everybody.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:10%
>> The collaboration between
Barbara and Stephen Dinan has

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:10%
been very important because
he is a very grounded person.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:10%
He is a producer.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:10%
And he's also a visionary,
so they spark one

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:10%
another's creativity.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:10%
He and his team have been
able to get her work out there

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.120 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I see Barbara is
that she has designed her life,

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously, from a higher
level as a preparation,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:84%
an 82-year preparation to play
this role of being the midwife,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
being the narrator, being
the prophetic voice for this

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:90%
birthing moment for humanity.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I've just been laying out the
schedule for the Los Angeles

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
event, and it really is
starting to crystallize for me.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like just seeing how the
different pieces fit together

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and this envisioning that--

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
like, newness, the moment
when we come together,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.442 align:middle line:84%
marking that as the
birthing moment, globally.

00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:07.242 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In the coming months,
we're mobilizing this campaign

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:10%
for a positive future.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:10%
We have a grassroots tour with
our beloved midwife, Barbara

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:10%
Marx Hubbard, with 14 leaders
lighting the way, a TV channel,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:10%
and most important,
hubs of co-creators

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:10%
forming around the world.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:34.548 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:35.546 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:23:35.546 --> 00:23:36.544 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:36.544 --> 00:23:37.344 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.344 --> 00:23:42.033 align:middle line:10%
Those of us who are celebrating
the birth of December 22nd

00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:44.924 align:middle line:10%
are rising up and
shining everywhere.

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:49.253 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.253 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Please come on up
and receive your award.

[APPLAUSE]

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the things that
she might have called success

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:90%
started happening around her.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.017 align:middle line:90%
She started getting invited.

00:23:59.017 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Somebody wanted to write a book.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Somebody wanted to make a movie.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
There were people who wanted
to have her teachings.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
She was traveling more.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:84%
She barely doesn't have
a minute now to herself

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:90%
because she is so busy.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We are going now to the
assisted living that Sidney

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:90%
lives in.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a challenge
with a beloved partner.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very painful to me to see
that loss of memory and loss

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
of vitality.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.154 align:middle line:90%
Hi, there.

00:24:33.154 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Mama, mm.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:24:35.564 --> 00:24:36.364 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>> What I have with Barbara is
the need to be in touch with

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:10%
her for her to re-energize
her and energize me.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
A call with her, or a
time with her, or so on,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.570 align:middle line:90%
is very important to me.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He's almost 90 and
dementia has set in.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I go in
there, I literally

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:84%
have to steel myself
against tremendous sadness.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.614 align:middle line:90%
You know how much I love you.

00:25:07.614 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Love you, love you.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Barbara.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. (VOICEOVER)
And I can't help him,

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
except go and be
with him every day.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:84%
But I can't take care
of him and do this work.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Crisis precedes transformation.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Birth is facilitated
by the crisis

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can't go back
to do more of the same.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Barbara uses the term
that crises are evolutionary

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:90%
drivers.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Overpopulation's a problem.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.446 align:middle line:10%
Pollution's a problem.

00:25:54.446 --> 00:25:56.055 align:middle line:10%
>> Dealing with climate change.

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:57.585 align:middle line:10%
>> Ever-increasing consumption.

00:25:57.585 --> 00:25:59.895 align:middle line:10%
>> War is going on
all over this world.

00:25:59.895 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:10%
>> It's kind of a crucible.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:10%
>> And so that has been a
driver of transformation out

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:10%
of necessity.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>> The pressure of
these problems, in fact,

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:10%
accelerates our need
to find solutions.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>> The things that are not
working are actually the raw

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:10%
material for creating
this better world.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I was amazed,
on my book tour,

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:10%
how many people are pessimistic,
deeply pessimistic about

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:10%
the future.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They look out and
they see poverty

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and the financial
crisis, climate change.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:84%
You tend to be more
pessimistic about things

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
if you think that the last
300 years were some disaster

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
good before that.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't see how bad things
have been, or how much worse

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
they have been, or how
much more unconscious

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we have been in
history, then you

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
will be less likely to see
the current challenges we

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:84%
face as a natural expression
of cultural evolution moving

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
bunch of new theorists,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
or new revolutionaries, in some
sense, who are proposing that.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, conscious
evolution, which I think is not

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
so widespread and maybe
won't be for some time,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
is the awareness that we are
evolution becoming conscious

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
of itself.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
That is so amazing,
that we are now

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
able to make some choices
to evolve ourselves

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:90%
to a higher state of being?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I think conscious evolution
will be so attractive

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that eventually, it will become
a dominant and well-known

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:90%
worldview.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I think people who
are fundamentalists

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
of any kind, who have
a very closed system

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
idea of the nature of reality,
will not be attracted to it.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:90%
I am a journal writer.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I have 182 volumes of black
books that I've dated.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So I name every
journal as to what

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I think the theme is
that I'm working on.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
That's very meaningful to
me because my magnum opus

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:90%
is in these journals.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual path,
for many, many years,

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
was asking questions,
listening, and writing

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
not by meditation or altered
states, but higher knowing.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And I found that if I could
stop thinking and writing

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:84%
through knowing, direct
knowing, that I would be led.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:10%
>> She often refers to it as a
communion with her own higher

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:10%
source.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the essential
teaching of new thought,

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that by contacting
that essential self,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
you gain access to wisdom
and to a field of energy

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that is
virtually limitless,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and out of which you
can create anything.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:10%
>> What came out in my own
writing was there's suddenly

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:10%
enough people on Earth who
are able to love one another,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:10%
able to love nature and Earth,
that what is needed now is

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:10%
the connectivity of the
people who already know this.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:10%
And when they connect,
you will not necessarily

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:10%
have the rapture, but you
will have the resonance.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the visions of
a planetary birth experience

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
would be enough
people in resonance,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:90%
in the feeling of love.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:84%
One greatest
influencers in my life,

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and the first love of my
life, was my husband, Earl.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:10%
>> They met in 1949, in
Paris, at a wonderful little

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:10%
restaurant on the left bank.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:10%
And it was one of
those setups where

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:10%
there were long tables and
people would just sit down

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:10%
wherever there was a space.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that time,
I was attempting to be

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:90%
an existentialist.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had a goulash
cigarette and I ordered

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:90%
a half bottle of red wine.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
When this young man came
in and sat opposite me,

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.967 align:middle line:84%
and I boldly said, would
you like some of this wine?

00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a question that
had really become

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
a driving force in my life.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And the question
was, what do you

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
think is the meaning of all
this new power that's good?

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
purpose in relationship

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:90%
to this purpose of our power?

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Earl
exactly that question.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And it amazed me when he said,
without a moment's hesitation,

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I am an artist.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeking a new image of
man commensurate with our power

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to shape the future.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And it flashed in my mind--

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.274 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to marry you.

00:31:59.274 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:90%
[BELLS RINGING]

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.520 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We returned to
New York to marry.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I had my doubts about
marriage, not about love.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking down
the aisle thinking,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
you're heading for
a head-on crash.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
expectation of the day.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:10%
We lived in Lime
Rock, Connecticut.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:10%
Earl worked on his art
and we started a family.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I found myself
in Lime Rock, Connecticut,

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:44.440 align:middle line:84%
pregnant in a little one-room
house with an artist husband.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember waking
up saying, well,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:90%
where did Barbara Marx go?

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.260 align:middle line:84%
When you think of a woman like
me having five children that I

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
adored, and I was a
24/7 mom, and I took

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the children every
day to school,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.240 align:middle line:84%
every day to the frog pond,
every day to this, read

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
to them, loved them, they
were the joy of my life,

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't even touch the
part of me that has vocation.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>> And she said, I
can't do this anymore.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:10%
I can't give my life
over to simply the PTA.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's about what she
meant I think Jonas Salk first,

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately, Abraham Maslow.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think Salk particularly,
and to a certain extent,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.325 align:middle line:84%
Maslow, both
acknowledged that there

00:33:31.325 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:84%
was something going on in her
head that was really vital.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Jonas Salk was the famous
inventor of the polio vaccine.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:84%
He was starting
the Salk Institute,

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
which would study how science
could help transform humanity.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately
drawn in by a project

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.240 align:middle line:90%
he called, The Theater of Man.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I began to write the letter
as to what that should be.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It should be a place
we can celebrate

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the emergence of the next
stage of human evolution.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks
later, a phone rang.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Mrs. Hubbard?

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is Dr. Salk.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I read your description
of The Theater of Man.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.839 align:middle line:84%
You have stated my vision
better than I could.

00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Could I take you to lunch?

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:84%
That conversation
changed my life.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:45.900 align:middle line:10%
>> He saw her, that she was
seeing something that was

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.800 align:middle line:10%
different.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that she was, in fact,
the cutting edge of evolution.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And to be seen like that for the
first time rather than neurotic

00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and discontent and what's
wrong with you, was revelatory.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But the bigger
revelation was yet to come.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It was a vision of the
future for all of us.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.340 align:middle line:10%
The second major question
that shaped my life

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:10%
was what is our story
comparable to the story

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:10%
of the birth of Christ?

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:84%
In the gospel, there
was a simple story

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that anybody could
understand-- a child is born

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and then all the rest followed.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:90%
What's our story?

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:84%
What's our story that would
be comparable to the story

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:90%
of the birth of Christ?

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:10%
One day I was taking a walk
in the hills above my home.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:10%
I'd been doing a lot of
reading about the great mystics

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual teachers of
the past in relationship

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:10%
to a positive
future for humanity.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't quite bring
all of my thoughts together.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Frustrated, I suddenly
stopped and posed a question

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
to the universe--

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:90%
what is humanity's new story?

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.000 align:middle line:84%
In a flash, I was
catapulted into the future

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and I could see a few frames
ahead in the movie of creation.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
Earth from space

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was a member of
Earth simultaneously.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And Earth was,
[GASPS] struggling

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to breathe, running
out of energy.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I could feel the pain.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:10%
At one point, there was
a moment of shared pain

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.800 align:middle line:10%
so great that we stopped.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment of stopping,
through pain came empathy,

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.920 align:middle line:84%
came love, very
much like we've had

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.270 align:middle line:84%
at 9/11, or at the terrible
tsunamis or hurricanes.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:90%
But usually, that empathy stops.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:90%
This time, it didn't stop.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And so she had a
mystical experience,

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:90%
which was not unusual.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.310 align:middle line:84%
She's had many, but
this was potent.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I felt every basic social
system shift simultaneously

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:10%
as innovations and
breakthroughs connected.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Systems of health and education,
economics and environment

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:90%
began to coalesce seamlessly.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a vision like a film,
where we began to coordinate

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.975 align:middle line:84%
and help each other
and live with empathy.

00:37:35.975 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I had a quick
glimpse of what's actually true.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It's we are a
living system and we

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:84%
have, through our internet,
through our communication

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
systems, through
our connectivity,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
we're beginning to
knit together as one.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Out of this love
combined with power,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:10%
and it just occurs to me
that in our childhood,

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:10%
we had power with our dad, who
was loving but also had rage,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:10%
like Jehovah.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And our mother, who was
very loving, but not potent.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara, in this
vision, saw humanity

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
combining our powers with
love, empathy, and creativity.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that moment,
I heard the words,

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.235 align:middle line:90%
our story is a birth.

00:38:32.235 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
What Christ and all the great
beings came to Earth to reveal

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is we're one, we're whole,
we're good, we're universal.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Go tell this story, Barbara.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> She got her marching orders.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:10%
She was determined to go forth
in this bold, courageous way

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:11.110 align:middle line:10%
to do whatever she needed to
do, to talk to who ever she

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:10%
needed to talk to, to tell
people, to be that messenger.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The new story of the
evolution of our species with

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:84%
us becoming conscious
participants was the story that

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:90%
I'd been looking for.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And I then decided to
write a book called

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.760 align:middle line:10%
"Conscious Evolution: Awakening
the Power of Our Social

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:10%
Potential."

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we'd had the
human potential movement,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but we really didn't have the
social potential movement,

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
or the self-actualizing society.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm really excited.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a production meeting
is a place where you destroy

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.132 align:middle line:10%
everything you've made before.

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.016 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the juxtaposition
of the Mayan calendar ending

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and the world coming to an end
is great because it's not going

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:90%
So now what is going to happen?

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHUCKLES] That's right.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:90%
That's why we call this day one.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's several things
activating in India,

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and then Jerusalem in Israel,
and then probably France.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there's basically
this kind of successive waves

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that go around the planet.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to Los
Angeles, and that's

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.430 align:middle line:84%
where we're gathering a
lot of the star power.

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:33.105 align:middle line:84%
If we're fortunate, there's good
leads with Sting and Santana.

00:40:33.105 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's the target audience?

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> For the leading
edge, New Age,

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.974 align:middle line:84%
new paradigm kind of folks that
will be kind of more attracted

00:40:38.974 --> 00:40:41.306 align:middle line:84%
in at the beginning, those
are the people who tend to be

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:43.257 align:middle line:84%
activating a lot of
events right now.

00:40:43.257 --> 00:40:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going to
kind of keep building

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.085 align:middle line:90%
to be more and more mainstream.

00:40:47.085 --> 00:40:49.626 align:middle line:84%
It has to be accessible
to a broad audience

00:40:49.626 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's going to
be seen by a lot of people.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The only answer to stopping
war and stopping destruction is

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.920 align:middle line:84%
connecting up, very rapidly,
that which is creative, loving,

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.160 align:middle line:84%
kind, and showing the shift
that nature and human nature is

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.716 align:middle line:84%
actually doing now, but
hasn't yet become visible.

00:41:23.716 --> 00:41:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The shift is much closer
than most people realize.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:10%
We are already there.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:10%
>> What I'm seeing is this
massive shift worldwide,

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:10%
waking up to the fact that
we don't exist in isolation.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.910 align:middle line:10%
>> A spontaneous
collective awakening,

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.520 align:middle line:10%
and I think that'd
be really exciting.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.119 align:middle line:10%
>> And that love will be
the currency of exchange.

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:10%
And I know it sounds a little
woo-woo and a little out there.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:10%
>> But it is happening.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.660 align:middle line:10%
When I think
tipping point, is it

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:10%
going to be I wake up
tomorrow and it's happened?

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.530 align:middle line:10%
Maybe.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not one who really
buys into the Eureka theory

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.700 align:middle line:10%
of personal transformation.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:10%
I think that change comes
one ah-ha at a time.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it's one
heart at the time,

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.330 align:middle line:10%
but that can happen very quick.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:10%
That can go viral.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:10%
>> And we also have now is
the ability to reach seven,

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:10%
eight billion people
around the world in a week.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And after a while, we reach
a geometric tipping point.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I wouldn't be surprised that
2020 we look back, and we go,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.885 align:middle line:10%
wow, this is when this
movement started to happen.

00:42:43.885 --> 00:42:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm not sure if we're
going to see a flash point,

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:10%
like on a certain date
everyone wakes up and goes, oh,

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:10%
I want to hug.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.188 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.188 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a tendency
to look for some date,

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:02.415 align:middle line:84%
some event that is going to
represent a turning point,

00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:05.625 align:middle line:84%
that irrevocable moment when
culture is going to shift.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:10.195 align:middle line:10%
>> Our crisis is a birth.

00:43:10.195 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:10%
>> We stand on the precipice of
a dramatic moment of choice--

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:10%
extinction or evolution.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.710 align:middle line:84%
What will it take to turn our
crisis into a historic turning?

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.030 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a romantic
idealism in that,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:10%
and the reverse side of that
is a sort of cynicism when it

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.735 align:middle line:10%
doesn't happen, when
it can't happen.

00:43:30.735 --> 00:43:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> People have been talking
about the end of the world

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:90%
since the world began.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.662 align:middle line:84%
And often, it's not just
the world collapsing.

00:43:37.662 --> 00:43:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end times.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something rising out of
it, a new Eden, a new era,

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the dawning of the
Age of Aquarius,

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the rebirth, whatever
you want to call it.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a powerful force in
the founding of this country.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.770 align:middle line:10%
I mean, our country was founded
by religious zealots coming

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.890 align:middle line:10%
here, to the new world, thinking
it was the new Jerusalem,

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.150 align:middle line:10%
it was the city on a hill.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.790 align:middle line:10%
>> And this idea that
we're all going to shift,

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:10%
or wake up to a
new consciousness,

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:10%
or go through some global
transformation like that, well,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of things
may happen over time,

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.670 align:middle line:10%
but there's not going to
be some moment like that.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And there never could
be and there never

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.470 align:middle line:90%
will be, in my humble opinion.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:10%
>> What is your highest
intention or expectation

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.776 align:middle line:10%
for this event?

00:44:22.776 --> 00:44:23.592 align:middle line:10%
Describe that.

00:44:23.592 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:10%
>> There will be a shift of
consciousness on planet Earth

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:10%
during the planetary
birth experience.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it from
space-- we are one planet.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.597 align:middle line:90%
We are all members of it.

00:44:36.597 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:10%
All the pioneers of
the peace movement,

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:10%
the women's movement, the
civil rights movement,

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness movement,
the futurist movement,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.120 align:middle line:10%
all those great movements,
they're toward a new culture.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We do have the
capacity, if we connect,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to meet the basic
needs of humanity,

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:90%
stop fighting, and move forward.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:84%
When enough people feel
that simultaneously,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.960 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness will shift
and the behavior pattern

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:84%
of self-centric
consciousness will diminish.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:90%
The stakes are everything.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.540 align:middle line:90%
The gamble is absolute.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:90%
The odds are millions to one.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.858 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I have no choice
but to do my best.

00:45:30.858 --> 00:45:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We have main engine starts,
four, three, two, one, zero.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.445 align:middle line:90%
Lift off.

00:45:40.445 --> 00:45:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> My husband Earl and I
were focused on the question,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
what new achievements had
the power to literally change

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.850 align:middle line:90%
humanity in a moment?

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It started, actually, with
the American Space Program

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Apollo program, and
realizing we were becoming

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials ourselves.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Then we began to speak
about it and write about it.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the counter-cultura
movements of the 1960s and 70s

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.340 align:middle line:84%
were anti-technology,
or anti-modern,

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.620 align:middle line:90%
or even anti-American.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But Barbara, she was pro of the
space program, pro-technology.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:20.960 align:middle line:90%
She was optimistic.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:84%
She had this kind of
forward-looking vision.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to go back
to a earlier, simpler time.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.460 align:middle line:84%
That optimism is so
quintessentially American.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:84%
She really kind
of carried forward

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
some quality of
her own upbringing

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and of her father's maybe
simplistic and naive, but also

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:84%
powerful optimistic vision
of what this country could

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.772 align:middle line:90%
be and should be.

00:46:47.772 --> 00:46:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> We saw it, really, as a
direction for human evolution.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.680 align:middle line:10%
>> They would go out together
and be talking about this,

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:10%
but it used to be my father
mainly talking about it.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't have
that radiant quality

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that my mother did,
being pregnant with this.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And people were
attracted to her,

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and that really hurt my father.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:10%
>> All of a sudden, it became
unbearable not to be able

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:10%
to have a stage of her own.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And the reason I left Earl
is I couldn't express my life

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:84%
purpose directly with
him because he saw it

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
as a suppression of him,
or a rejection of him,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.737 align:middle line:84%
even though I thought
of it as an expansion.

00:47:39.737 --> 00:47:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:84%
When I saw the first human
footsteps on the moon,

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I wept with joy.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.920 align:middle line:90%
We were being born.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We had breached
the tomb of earth.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We met with scientists
and astronauts,

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and came up with a
new global goal--

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:10.060 align:middle line:84%
to use the great technologies
developed in the Apollo program

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to build new worlds
on this Earth,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:90%
as well as new worlds in space.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Together with my new
partner, John Whiteside,

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:84%
we went to NASA to
see how it would

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:84%
be possible for the people
to participate in the space

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So John Whiteside and I
went to Werner von Braun,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and we said, we
would like to ask you

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.920 align:middle line:84%
if the people could
rent a Saturn V

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.440 align:middle line:90%
rocket for involvement.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And he was totally stunned.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:44.440 align:middle line:90%
He was amazed.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.281 align:middle line:90%
At first, he said, what?

00:48:46.281 --> 00:48:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, he said,
well, I don't see why

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.670 align:middle line:90%
not if you can get $400 million.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And we had astronauts
that wanted to do it,

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:84%
so we were taken in to look
at the Saturn V rocket.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And I quite remember taking
out of my purse, my lipstick,

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and writing on this
huge Saturn V rocket,

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:90%
"the people's rocket."

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:13.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The vision of bringing
the people into space

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:90%
almost happened.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Everyone said yes, except
the administration of NASA.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I was naive to think the
world could change quickly.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Simply because I could imagine
it didn't mean others could.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.090 align:middle line:84%
But I learned to say
yes to the possibility,

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that big visions open
up other people's sense of what

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We were going to be able
to intentionally create

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.650 align:middle line:84%
a more positive future,
but we couldn't do it

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.050 align:middle line:90%
if we didn't have visions of it.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.900 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't do it if we
didn't have images of it.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:10%
I think that you might find
by 2050 that we have restored

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:10%
and have become
sustainable on this Earth,

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.750 align:middle line:10%
that we have moved
into self-governing

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:10%
at a global scale.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.530 align:middle line:84%
As a nation state
and the cultures

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that created them will probably
become cultural artifacts,

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.920 align:middle line:84%
like the monarchy
in Great Britain.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.530 align:middle line:84%
War will be considered outmoded
and obscene and unnecessary.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll have communities
beginning in outer space,

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we will have developed
solar energy from space, which

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.840 align:middle line:84%
will completely change
the economic system based

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.130 align:middle line:90%
on fossil fuels.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.500 align:middle line:10%
I believe we will
have really developed

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:10%
a monetary democracy
which is alternative forms

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.580 align:middle line:10%
of complementary currencies
so that we're not

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.935 align:middle line:10%
the victims of a monetary system
designed on debt and scarcity.

00:51:10.935 --> 00:51:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And since we are deeply focused
on understanding and getting

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:21.850 align:middle line:84%
over these terrible
diseases, like cancer,

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that we will have
discovered how to extend life

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and how to improve
the quality of life.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.640 align:middle line:84%
The greatest blessing
is the freedom

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.440 align:middle line:90%
to do your life purpose.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And in this society,
people will really

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:45.600 align:middle line:84%
be yearning to be able to
give their gift and create.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Where you look
is where you go.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:10%
What I focus on becomes
what I call my reality.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:10%
>> The old saying is, I'll
believe it when I see it.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:59.820 align:middle line:10%
And that old piece of wisdom
has the sequence exactly wrong.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.250 align:middle line:10%
It's the opposite-- when you
believe it strongly enough,

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:10%
you literally create the
conditions for seeing it.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:10%
>> This is no longer
a weird conversation.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.500 align:middle line:10%
This is a conversation
that everyone is having.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> People can talk
about law of attraction,

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and they can talk about creating
the reality and nobody looks

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:10%
at you askance.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Please be skeptical.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Please don't buy
this, because it's not

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.840 align:middle line:10%
possible to predict the
kind of transformation

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.761 align:middle line:10%
and the kind of
evolutionary leap

00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:10%
that Barbara's speaking about.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:10%
>> But what great visionaries
do for us is through

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:38.030 align:middle line:10%
their imagination, they see the
world as we want to create it.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think our thoughts
shape our reality.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.880 align:middle line:10%
They change the way we
operate in the world, which

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.150 align:middle line:10%
is very important, having
a positive attitude,

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:49.070 align:middle line:10%
cultivating awareness
and compassion.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And loving kindness
is really important.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part
of this movement.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that all we
have to do is visualize it

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.365 align:middle line:84%
and it will happen, in some
ways, is a dangerous idea.

00:53:02.365 --> 00:53:05.910 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.822 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of strange
kind of grandiosity,

00:53:08.822 --> 00:53:15.620 align:middle line:84%
an almost self-centeredness
in it, almost a narcissism.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Visualize world peace and
that's going to do it.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to our
second-to-last class.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Barbara?

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.920 align:middle line:10%
>> We're clearly doing what
has not been done before.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:38.010 align:middle line:10%
We're clearly inspired
by a vision of potential.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned is the
most important thing anyone

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:84%
can do beside loving is
saying yes to life purpose.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that yes activates in
you the energy of creation.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:55.530 align:middle line:10%
>> She takes people out of
just being passive students

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.360 align:middle line:10%
and really turns them in--

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.160 align:middle line:10%
unleashes them.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:16.250 align:middle line:90%


00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The question is, what
has been born in you that is

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:27.110 align:middle line:10%
of the greatest value to you and
your contribution to the shift?

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.325 align:middle line:90%
>> --really being a part of--

00:54:28.325 --> 00:54:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> As the Birth 2012
event approaches,

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm connecting with my students.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We're declaring our
intention for the birth.

learning environment with

00:54:40.865 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:10%

was conceived nine months ago

become so vocationally aroused

to gather together to deepen
their own life purpose,

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.540 align:middle line:90%
to find their part in evolution.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.430 align:middle line:84%
As my father said,
you're an American.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Do your best.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I would say, you're
an evolutionary.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:12.123 align:middle line:90%
Do your best.

00:55:12.123 --> 00:55:13.602 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:13.602 --> 00:55:26.522 align:middle line:90%


00:55:26.522 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:10%
>> There's all kinds of things
that people really love that

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.610 align:middle line:10%
the world really needs.

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:32.660 align:middle line:10%
And there's ways
to monetize that.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.650 align:middle line:10%
You can make a living at it.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I always say, you can
do well by doing good.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.095 align:middle line:90%
And so, I have.

00:55:38.095 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is how I
came up with the phrase,

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.550 align:middle line:90%
vocational arousal.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get turned
on to a life purpose,

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.535 align:middle line:84%
it will take the lid off
the top of your vocation.

>> It's a bit of an
elitist movement.

They do tend to be mostly
white and mostly older,

that already have

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.350 align:middle line:84%
their basic needs met and
have the time and the money

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to go to these workshops
and these retreats centers

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and to do the work that people
are talking about when they

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:07.060 align:middle line:90%
say the consciousness movement.

And she says, it's all right
if you speak to the choir.

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:84%
She said, I may be
singing to the choir,

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:90%
but the choir isn't singing.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:23.470 align:middle line:84%

one after another, it's
rife with possibility.

And so one of her purposes
is to get the choir

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to sing one of the most
beautiful melodies that perhaps

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.650 align:middle line:90%
has ever been heard.

And of course, Barbara's not,
in essence, a politician,

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:24.150 align:middle line:10%
and she didn't feel
that was appropriate.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But what an honor to
have Bucky Fuller say,

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I think you should be president.

>> We are going to win.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the year of the
woman, the year of big brother,

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and the year that you ran for
vice president, as a woman,

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:57.910 align:middle line:90%
you could get a hearing.

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> How could she be nominated?

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.510 align:middle line:10%
She had no political
background, no funding.

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It was totally ridiculous.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But here is an example
of the power of belief.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.310 align:middle line:10%
>> She was labeled
as a New Ager.

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.350 align:middle line:10%
And a New Ager in those
days wasn't particularly

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:12.150 align:middle line:10%
a good thing.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It's considered to
be a great thing now.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:20.505 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was running, you see,
on a mission that transcended

00:58:20.505 --> 00:58:21.305 align:middle line:90%
politics.

00:58:21.305 --> 00:58:26.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, her vision in this
campaign was to create a peace

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:29.270 align:middle line:10%
room in the Office of
the Vice Presidency.

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that this would
be a counterpart to the war

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.390 align:middle line:90%
room in the Pentagon.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the war
room, what goes on

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.800 align:middle line:84%
there is the tracking of all the
violence and the wars going on

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.090 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And in the peace room, the idea
was to track, map, connect,

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.730 align:middle line:10%
and communicate all the good
news, all the good things,

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:middle line:10%
the innovations.

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:02.100 align:middle line:10%
>> So we had 90
positive future centers,

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:06.600 align:middle line:10%
and they would hold the vision,
Barbara will be nominated

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.430 align:middle line:10%
for Vice President
of the United States.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:13.320 align:middle line:10%
Doubt, doubt, doubt-- a
totally impossible goal.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.800 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea behind that, if
you hold an intent of what you

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.700 align:middle line:10%
want, and you hold it
in the present tense,

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.740 align:middle line:10%
that is the way things manifest.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
these people were doing.

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As president, I
will work for peace.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And she came to the
Democratic National Convention

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that year with a boatload of
people who wanted her to run,

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.580 align:middle line:84%
but nobody in the political
establishment, you see.

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.160 align:middle line:10%
She had to have delegates
on the floor that

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.780 align:middle line:10%
would place her
name in nomination,

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.730 align:middle line:10%
or all the grassroots support
would mean nothing at all.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, the Democrats
were horrified that this

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.320 align:middle line:84%
unknown woman who was not
a force in politics at all,

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.340 align:middle line:90%
that this could happen.

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like, how did this
slip through the system?

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.207 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:00.207 --> 01:00:09.990 align:middle line:90%


01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Barbara Hubbard has a
message and a vision to offer

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.650 align:middle line:10%
the Democratic Party and
the people of this world.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It is a message of hope.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It is a vision of the future.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Is with great pleasure that I
place in nomination the name

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
of Barbara Marx Hubbard.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And the guard took my arm to
lead me to the podium that we

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:36.480 align:middle line:84%
had envisioned in all of
these small churches and yoga

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
centers.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The guard said, they
won't listen to you,

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
but tell it to the universe.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.200 align:middle line:90%
And by God, she did.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It is now in our capacity
to destroy civilization

as we know it, or

opportunity for all people.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We must bring together
the genius now focused

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
in the war room in a peace
room in The White House.

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:08.490 align:middle line:84%

the real enemies of humanity--

hunger, disease, illiteracy,
poverty, and war.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.810 align:middle line:10%
With your help, I
can gather the people

to build the peace room and
the Office for the Future

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.765 align:middle line:10%
in this administration.

>> She got people talking.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
She created a conversation
that was happening before.

about the vice presidential

>> I just can't believe it.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I gave people
a transcendent goal.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It was to be nominated
for vice president

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%

01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
What year?

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%

And how many little false

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
starts?

>> How to get to the
peaceful transformation.

01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, none of these
things happened.

[CHUCKLES] The US-USSR
Symposium-- that happened.

The new politics-- well, we're
still lagging on that one.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.220 align:middle line:10%
I have done my best, but.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.440 align:middle line:10%
It's always been in the
transformational movement.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So just recently, we
received a grant and we

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
hired some professional PR
people because the news media--

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, we're the news.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns out,
after hiring these people,

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to Australia.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:48.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm?

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:49.523 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

All of this just as I'm leaving.

were somehow
becoming more famous,

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.890 align:middle line:10%
were being asked to be on

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.630 align:middle line:10%
hadn't been asked to be on.

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.830 align:middle line:10%
There was a sense--

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.050 align:middle line:10%
I don't ever think it
was for her personal ego,

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.560 align:middle line:10%
but the sense that she was
failing in this mission that

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560 align:middle line:10%
meant everything to her.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.440 align:middle line:10%

than a heartbreak.

It was like a disruption that
really left kind of her spirit

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to reframe
what we mean by news.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Currently, news is an
infantile nervous system

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
reporting on disaster
and breakdown

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and putting us to sleep.

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The new news is reporting on
what's emerging, creative,

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and where we want
to go to create it.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.920 align:middle line:90%
You need both.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You need to know
it's breaking down,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.390 align:middle line:84%
but it will kill you
if that's all you know.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:59.990 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:02.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't watch television
news much anymore,

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:03.870 align:middle line:10%
and I used to own
five TV stations.

01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:08.410 align:middle line:10%
>> The negative news media feeds
the general fear and hysteria

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:09.210 align:middle line:10%
of the time.

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been so driven by money
and interests that are not

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:14.270 align:middle line:10%
coming from the heart.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.800 align:middle line:10%
>> There needs to be much
more of a solutions-focus.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.180 align:middle line:10%
>> There's always positive
things going on in the world

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.640 align:middle line:10%
at the same time that
there is negativity.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a lot of reasons
why any of us could fall

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
into pessimism.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of reasons, on
the other side as well, there's

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that are
better than they've ever

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
been in human history,
by dramatic margins.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.925 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the pessimists
kind of ignore all that data.

01:06:40.925 --> 01:06:43.383 align:middle line:10%
>> And as someone who worked
on a newspaper for many years,

01:06:43.383 --> 01:06:44.210 align:middle line:10%
I understand that.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:47.210 align:middle line:90%


01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that conflict
and drama make a good story,

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
so we tend to focus on
those kinds of stories.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.174 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
positive social change

01:06:56.174 --> 01:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
out there that
doesn't get covered

01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:59.545 align:middle line:84%
and that no one's really
paying attention to.

01:06:59.545 --> 01:07:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I think she sees Birth
2012 as a way of us showing

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:07.100 align:middle line:10%
ourselves to ourselves so
that we'll stop believing all

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.370 align:middle line:10%
the negativity and all the
lack that we see in what is now

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:13.640 align:middle line:10%
our mainstream media, and get
a sense that we're hitting

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.210 align:middle line:10%
the surface with a new story.

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:20.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Looking at it now, I don't
think we've hit our goal of 100

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:20.890 align:middle line:10%
million.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:23.690 align:middle line:10%
But I think we got to really
accelerate to get to that.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:24.835 align:middle line:10%
>> Where are we at now?

01:07:24.835 --> 01:07:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I would estimate--

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.390 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, just off the top,
speculating-- five million,

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:31.415 align:middle line:10%
10 million?

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:33.510 align:middle line:10%
>>There are five or 10
million people registered?

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that that know about
this, heard about this,

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
seen it, read-- because
we get a lot of press.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's probably at least
40 events that we're going

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to carry feeds from over
the course of the two days,

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.694 align:middle line:84%
so that creates a lot
of technical complexity.

01:07:48.694 --> 01:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%
We're like three weeks away.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
keep yourself going?

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I made a commitment to do
an hour of meditation every day

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.003 align:middle line:84%
from now until the
birth, regardless.

01:07:57.003 --> 01:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%


01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Everyone is excited.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.010 align:middle line:10%
But beyond the
anticipation, it's

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:23.229 align:middle line:10%
important for me and for all of
us to visualize our intention.

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
We will reach 100
million people.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We will give birth to
a new era of evolution.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.713 align:middle line:10%
>> This is really a
fulfillment of a lifetime path.

01:08:32.713 --> 01:08:33.513 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:36.952 align:middle line:10%
>> Faithful to this, almost
15 years you've been faithful

01:08:36.952 --> 01:08:40.796 align:middle line:10%
to this vision and it's come
to fruition at this point.

01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this has all come out
of your vision, originally,

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Barbara.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.240 align:middle line:90%


01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.528 align:middle line:10%
Hello.

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:48.860 align:middle line:10%
Everyone here?

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.859 align:middle line:90%
Hello, world, out there.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And I am just so delighted
to be here and work with you.

01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:55.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Marx Hubbard had
been audacious enough

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.479 align:middle line:84%
to run for vice president
and audacious enough

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.790 align:middle line:90%
to envision a global birthday.

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And it just so
happens to coincide

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:08.536 align:middle line:84%
with her personal birthday,
so 83 years old and rocking it

01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:11.242 align:middle line:90%
out, Barbara Marx Hubbard.

01:09:11.242 --> 01:09:12.718 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:12.718 --> 01:09:14.686 align:middle line:90%


01:09:14.686 --> 01:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you know, to actually
be alive at the very moment

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
of an awareness of a
planetary birth is, for me,

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%
the greatest joy of my life.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.594 align:middle line:90%


01:09:35.594 --> 01:09:36.971 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:37.889 align:middle line:90%


01:09:37.889 --> 01:09:41.979 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the
love, the energy,

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
the creativity in this room
time thousands, times millions?

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:47.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:47.292 --> 01:09:48.735 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:48.735 --> 01:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.880 align:middle line:10%
>> December 22nd, 2012--

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.880 align:middle line:10%
if you're watching this
video, it means one thing--

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.680 align:middle line:10%
the world didn't end yesterday.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.576 align:middle line:10%
According to media reports of
an ancient Mayan prophecy--

01:10:10.576 --> 01:10:13.700 align:middle line:10%


01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.470 align:middle line:10%
>> She would like to have seen
something in the news about

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:19.860 align:middle line:10%
people recognizing
that it's a new time.

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:25.880 align:middle line:10%
But once the day passed,
it was like, silent.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
public expression

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
of a birth that had happened
and that something had shifted,

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and that this was a new time,
we are moving into another epic.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think she looked for
that to be the new news.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And it just wasn't there.

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think by 2012, the
mainstream news media was

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
so sick of all these New
Age prophecies that they

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:51.055 align:middle line:84%
didn't really pay
much attention to it.

01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:55.670 align:middle line:10%
>> She felt that this was a
fulfillment of her mission.

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
She was telling the
story of our birth,

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and then not much
happened afterwards.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was exhausted,
also, physically.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
fact that there wasn't

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
this magical transformation
that she believed

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
would happen, really happen,
that something big would

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
happen, momentous would
happen, it was very depressing

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't know
what next to do.

01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And when Barbara
doesn't know what

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
next to do for her
mission, there's

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous pain way beyond
what I think most of us feel.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:43.380 align:middle line:90%


01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I am depressed.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I have doubt as to whether it
is possible for people's effort,

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
including my own, to
make a difference.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.644 align:middle line:84%
I have lost my
arrow of evolution.

01:12:03.644 --> 01:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can't do it just by
an act of figuring it out.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.564 align:middle line:90%
I have to be guided.

01:12:08.564 --> 01:12:11.742 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.742 --> 01:12:13.562 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I really love.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) I
couldn't see the baby.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see where the
culture was actually evolving.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> With Birth 2012, well,
we made the announcement.

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We experienced the
birth and we have

01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:32.270 align:middle line:90%
a global moment of oneness.

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
It was experienced by all of us.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we were like,
where's the baby?

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:38.935 align:middle line:90%
Where's the baby?

01:12:38.935 --> 01:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the students were
right there with Barbara.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.940 align:middle line:10%
They were in a
state of confusion.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.565 align:middle line:10%
Many of them were
disillusioned as well.

01:12:46.565 --> 01:12:51.650 align:middle line:10%
And I was receiving calls from
people wanting to know well,

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:53.330 align:middle line:10%
why had we done all of this?

01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It was naive and grandiose
to think that that event would

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
change the world with the
resources that we had there

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.900 align:middle line:90%
with it.

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it's naive to think

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
that the world will change.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, we can't create
it unless we sit down around

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:13.460 align:middle line:10%
the table and at our computers
and at our meetings and figure

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.396 align:middle line:10%
out how do you actually
achieve those goals?

01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
How do you fund them?

01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
them into society?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.810 align:middle line:90%
How do you communicate them?

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is the difference
between activism and sort

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of self-congratulatory
magical thinking.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:49.010 align:middle line:90%


01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very easy
to feel a failure,

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
particularly if you
have a big vision.

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:57.800 align:middle line:90%
So I did feel a failure.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what shall I do now?

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:10.024 align:middle line:90%


01:14:10.024 --> 01:14:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to meditate.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring the
highest frequency in and see

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.330 align:middle line:90%
what happens to me.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:23.800 align:middle line:90%


01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Put this purpose first.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Put this purpose first really
is a spiritual requirement

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
to give your best.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%


01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Our father's pronouncement
that he kept saying--

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.020 align:middle line:90%
do your best.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That has been a real motivating
force to do her best.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:50.330 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't think, in any way,
Barbara has failed at anything,

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:53.150 align:middle line:10%
because I think she's done what
she was here to do brilliantly.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And now it's for the
rest of us to step up

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.486 align:middle line:90%
and do the rest of the work.

01:14:56.486 --> 01:14:59.402 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.402 --> 01:15:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>> My mission is to transform
educational systems around

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.340 align:middle line:10%
the world to eradicate
poverty and hunger.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And we organized a national
tour speaking to school

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.380 align:middle line:10%
assemblies about the environment
and what young people could do

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.796 align:middle line:10%
to make a difference
in the world.

01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We're on a tour called
Inspire My Generation Tour.

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And the premise
of that is that we

01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:21.190 align:middle line:10%
have all the same capabilities
that someone like Martin Luther

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.530 align:middle line:10%
King, that somebody like
Gandhi have in our ability

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.104 align:middle line:10%
to transform the world.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And one of the things that
I've always held in my heart

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.850 align:middle line:10%
for Barbara and one of my deep
heart wishes is for her to have

01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:33.130 align:middle line:10%
a sense of fulfillment and
see that the changes that

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:36.190 align:middle line:10%
she's envisioned all these
years are actually taking place,

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:38.080 align:middle line:10%
and it's my belief
that they are.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And she's been a tremendous
inspiration to me, personally,

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.690 align:middle line:10%
as she's been to thousands,
if not millions of people.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>> We are all catching
Barbara's vision.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.740 align:middle line:10%
It's not just your
vision, Barbara.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.214 align:middle line:10%
It's the vision of
eternity, and we've got it.

01:15:55.214 --> 01:15:56.705 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:15:56.705 --> 01:16:22.600 align:middle line:90%


01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We hear people all over the
world talking about the idea

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.000 align:middle line:90%
of conscious evolution.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Without a doubt, I mean,
Barbara has done more than any

01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
single evolutionary or any
single theorist to spread

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:39.145 align:middle line:84%
the idea of conscious evolution,
to spread it very far.

01:16:39.145 --> 01:16:42.340 align:middle line:10%
>> She's really stuck with it.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.020 align:middle line:10%
And through a lot
of ups and downs,

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.080 align:middle line:10%
maybe more downs than ups.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just respect her tenacity
and the strength of her vision

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.320 align:middle line:90%
to continue with this.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I really went
back to my question,

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
what is our story comparable
to the story of the birth

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.050 align:middle line:90%
of Christ?

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I realized that story started
with a child born in a manger

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
that nobody could see.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the planetary consciousness
of a potential is born,

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's in a manger, as far
as the mass media is concerned,

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as general
public awareness.

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It didn't show
up, but I knew it.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I decided my
job, once again, is

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.780 align:middle line:90%
to make the invisible visible.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:18:41.336 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.336 --> 01:18:42.827 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:18:42.827 --> 01:18:46.803 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:18:48.294 --> 01:19:05.340 align:middle line:90%


01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.975 align:middle line:84%
What are images of the future
that we want to move toward?

01:19:08.975 --> 01:19:14.270 align:middle line:90%


01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:16.402 align:middle line:90%
Crisis precedes transformation.

01:19:16.402 --> 01:19:23.820 align:middle line:90%


01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:27.088 align:middle line:84%
We have to reframe
what we mean by news.

01:19:27.088 --> 01:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%


01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.175 align:middle line:84%
I would like people to become
so vocationally aroused.

01:19:34.175 --> 01:19:45.840 align:middle line:90%


01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.180 align:middle line:10%
Now that I'm 87
years old, I have

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.000 align:middle line:10%
joined in an
evolutionary partnership

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.090 align:middle line:10%
with my friend, Mark Gaffney,
to initiate a set of projects

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.520 align:middle line:10%
that we think can
actually influence

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.655 align:middle line:10%
the world in a
positive direction.

01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) I can see
laughter or I can see tears.

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:16.560 align:middle line:10%
I see a choice of love or fear.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, I thought
it might be from the Office

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Vice President
of the United States.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.862 align:middle line:84%
Now we're heading for
the United Nations.

01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:24.862 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) I can see--

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:30.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Barbara Marx Hubbard,
a visionary, educator,

01:20:30.965 --> 01:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
a person who has been
inspiring us for years.

01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:42.085 align:middle line:10%
And I think this house is
honored by your presence.

01:20:42.085 --> 01:20:43.528 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) I choose love.

01:20:43.528 --> 01:20:49.310 align:middle line:90%


01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:53.410 align:middle line:10%
>> You should create
offices for the future,

01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:57.650 align:middle line:10%
whatever name we call them, and
invite people from every nation

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:02.526 align:middle line:10%
state to join together
to solve the problems.

01:21:02.526 --> 01:21:07.436 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) I see us healing
and the darkness dying.

01:21:07.436 --> 01:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I see us dawning as
one world united.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%


01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:25.360 align:middle line:10%
So what do you choose,
mm, love or fear?

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we choose.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%


01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:44.560 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I choose the love with
freedom fire from my heart

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.560 align:middle line:10%
where the light keeps shining.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I choose to feel
the whole world cry.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I choose to feel
a one voice rising.

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And I choose to feel us
all united in the strength

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.460 align:middle line:10%
that we can rise above.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.960 align:middle line:10%
I choose love.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.560 align:middle line:90%


01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I choose love.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:16.660 align:middle line:90%


01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I choose love, love, love.

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:34.176 align:middle line:90%
