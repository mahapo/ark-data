00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.436 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
One of the greatest mysteries of
mankind is

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.705 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
Where did we come from?

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.041 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Scientists and philosophers
alike have pondered

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.444 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
this elusive question and put
forth many explanations,

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.747 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
but in truth, no one really
knows.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.017 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Good evening, I'm Charlton
Heston.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.120 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In their search for answers,
scientists gather evidence

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.158 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
and develop theories based on
what they observe.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.592 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
But sometimes evidence turns up

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.196 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
that completely contradicts
this.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.900 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Footprints resembling modern
man's were discovered in Texas

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.903 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
side by side with dinosaur
tracks.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:45.739 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Does this mean that man lived
millions of years ago

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.443 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
at the time of the dinosaur?

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.012 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
These 70 ton blocks were somehow
transported

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:55.782 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to the Peruvian mountain temple
of Ollantaytambo.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.720 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
The only source of this red
granite is five miles away

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
on the peak of another mountain.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.093 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
Ancient maps have been
discovered which

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:08.762 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
correctly depict the continent
of Antarctica

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:12.332 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
centuries before it was
discovered by Europeans.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.969 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Some claim this is evidence of a
technologically advanced culture

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.239 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
that existed before recorded
history began.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.746 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Tonight we'll examine these and
other controversial findings

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.815 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to see if what we're being
taught about the origins of man

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.917 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
is supported by the evidence.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.653 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
We'll meet a new breed of
scientific investigators

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.690 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
who claim that the history of
man and this planet

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.329 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
may be radically different than
what is accepted today.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.832 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Before the 19th century, western
man looked to the Bible

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.502 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
for an explanation of his
origins.

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.804 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
In the story of Genesis,

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:54.775 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
God created man from the dust of
the earth 6,000 years ago.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.943 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
But when man dug into the earth
for answers,

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.379 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
he found evidence that appeared
to tell a different story --

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.049 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:25%
evolution.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.453 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
In 1859, Charles Darwin
published his book,

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.889 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
The Origin of Species.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.391 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
This book put forth the
revolutionary idea that

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.393 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
all life on Earth could be
explained

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.829 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
by the workings of nature.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.199 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Instead of a supreme being
creating the diversity of life,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the theory of evolution proposes

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.504 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that accidental changes in
nature are the cause.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.806 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
These changes are governed by

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.741 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
the process of natural
selection,

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:32.045 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
survival of the fittest.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.916 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Over the past two centuries
archeologists have collected

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:39.986 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
bones and artifacts that suggest
there's a logical sequence

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:44.057 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
of evolutionary steps from ape
to man.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.794 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Man's earliest relatives were
ape-like beings

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.897 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
who appeared around 25 million
years ago.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.800 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
The first of those to walk
upright emerged

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.403 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
20 million years later.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:04:00.674 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Over the remaining 5 million
years he continued to evolve,

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:04.077 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
passing through various stages
of development until modern man,

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:08.548 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
like ourselves, emerged over
100,000 years ago.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.952 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Archeologists determine the age
of artifacts

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:16.256 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
by the level of strata, or layer
of earth, they are found in.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Recent artifacts associated with
modern man are generally found

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.330 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
close to the surface, while
older, more primitive artifacts

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.999 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
are in deeper layers of the
ground.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.904 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
But sometimes artifacts are
found that break all the rules.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.474 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
Archeologists call them
anomalous artifacts.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.977 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
What happens when we find a
modern human skull

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:43.984 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
in rock strata far beneath even
the oldest of man's ancestors?

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:47.154 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In their controversial book,
Forbidden Archeology,

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:50.490 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Michael Cremo and Dr. Richard
Thompson have documented

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.759 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
hundreds of these anomalous
artifacts

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.296 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
which have yet to be explained.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.132 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The basic body of evidence that
we've uncovered in this book

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:04.137 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
suggests that human beings of
modern anatomical type

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:08.108 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
have been existing for many,
many millions of years

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.609 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:35%
into the past.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:16.082 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
In 1880, California State
Geologist J.D. Whitney

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
was intrigued by an unexpected
discovery made 300 feet

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.888 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
under Table Mountain.

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.091 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
While digging for gold,

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.594 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
miners unearthed a variety of
stone tools

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.463 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
such as mortar and pestles and
ladles.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:34.534 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Incredibly, the rock strata the
tools were reportedly found in

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:38.838 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
was dated as early as 55 million
years old.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.041 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Whitney made a thorough report
of these finds

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.810 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
and came to an unsettling
conclusion: 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.446 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Man could be millions of years
older

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.216 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
than the current evolutionary
model suggests.

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:55.222 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
This bizarre evidence seems to
have been well documented,

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:58.558 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
yet the general public and many
within the scientific community

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.962 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
are unaware of these
controversial finds.

00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:03.697 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
The question is,

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.933 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
why haven't we heard of these
discoveries before?

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.736 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Oh, I think we're talking about
a massive cover-up.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.439 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
As I said, over the past 150
years,

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.576 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
these archeologists and
anthropologists have

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
covered up as much evidence as
they've dug up, literally.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.650 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Basically what you find is
something we call

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.585 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
a 'knowledge filter'.

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:29.456 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is a fundamental feature of
science.

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:32.559 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's also a fundamental feature
of human nature.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.495 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
People tend to filter out things
that don't fit,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.664 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
that don't make sense in terms
of their paradigm,

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.633 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
or their way of thinking.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.901 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
So, in science, you find that

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.271 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
evidence that doesn't fit the
accepted paradigm

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
tends to be eliminated.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.609 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
It's not taught, it's not
discussed,

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:53.780 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
and people who are educated in
scientific teachings

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.982 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
generally don't even learn about
it.

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.053 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
Conventional theory states

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.455 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
that modern man originated in
southern Africa

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.824 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
around 100,000 years ago.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:08.295 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
From there, he migrated north
into Europe and southern Asia.

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.930 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
He continued through Asia and
crossed the Bering Strait

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.067 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
into the new world around 30,000
years ago.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:16.403 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
He then came down through North
America

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:21.808 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and finally arrived in South
America around 15,000 years ago.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:24.010 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Yet numerous artifacts have been
found across

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.646 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
North and South America that are
so old,

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:29.316 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
they threaten to completely
overturn this theory.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.787 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
According to geologist Virginia
Steen-McIntyre,

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.022 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
she was silenced at the height
of her career

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.992 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
because of her determination to
report the facts.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.464 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
In the summer of 1966 a
collection of stone tools,

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.466 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
including this leaf-shaped spear
point

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.736 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
was uncovered at Hueyatlaco,
Mexico.

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:53.139 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
To find out exactly how old the
spear points were,

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.409 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
a team of experts from the
United States Geological Survey

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
was called in to date them.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.381 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
When we first began to work on
the Hueyatlaco site,

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:03.616 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
we thought we had an old site.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.585 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
This was back in '66, and we
thought it was perhaps

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.953 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
20,000 years old,

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:09.789 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
and at that time that was
considered a very old age

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.524 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
for the site.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.827 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
We did what they call
radiometric dates,

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.162 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
which gives an actual date
range,

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.131 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
and we used two different
methods to do that.

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:20.367 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
One was using uranium atoms,

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:24.037 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
another one was using little
zircon crystals.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:26.172 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
When we finally got the dates in
all the different methods

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:30.543 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
we used to date it, it came out
to be 250,000 years old.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.312 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
To tell you the truth, I would
have been happy

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:35.215 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
with a 20,000 year old date.
It would have made my career.

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.050 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
It was very old for the time,

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.686 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
but it wasn't so old that it was
that controversial.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.021 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
People can take 20,000 year
steps,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.358 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
they can't take steps that are
over 200,000 years at one time.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.026 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
And I was rather naive. I
thought, OK,

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.262 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
we've got something big here,
but I'm just going to

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.563 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
stick with the date.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.098 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've got the information, we've
got the facts.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.901 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Let's get the facts out and go
on from there.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.036 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And I didn't realize it was
going to ruin my whole career.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:01.975 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
According to Dr. McIntyre,
because she stuck to the facts,

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:05.779 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
all of her professional
opportunities were closed off.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:08.381 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
She has not worked in her chosen
field since.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.583 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
The site was closed,

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.252 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
and permission for further
investigation was denied.

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:15.021 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:21%
Forever.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.524 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
It's not necessarily a
deliberate conspiracy,

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:18.925 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
in the sense of some people
getting together

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.094 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
in a smoke filled room and
saying,

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
we're going to deceive people.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.532 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
It's something that happens
automatically

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:28.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
within the scientific community.

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.604 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
So when a given piece of
evidence disagrees with the

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.174 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
predominant theory, then
automatically

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:37.477 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
people won't talk about it, they
won't report it,

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:39.746 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and that means that science
fails to progress

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.781 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
in the way that one would hope.

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:50.590 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Dinosaurs left their tracks on
this riverbank

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.792 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
100 million years ago.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.862 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Did humans walk here at the same
time?

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:57.864 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Next, a man who claims these
prints are proof

00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:02.068 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that humans lived with the
dinosaurs.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:06.539 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ever since dinosaurs were first
discovered in the 18th century,

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.042 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
they've fascinated people of all
ages.

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:12.512 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Tyrannosaurus Rex stood over
30 feet in height.

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.514 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
He is considered the most
ferocious predator

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
ever to walk the earth.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.619 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
A Brontosaurus grew to the
length of three city buses.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.222 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
He weighed more than 90 tons.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:25.625 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The reign of the dinosaur ended,
according to one theory,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.827 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
when a giant meteor crashed into
the Earth

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.231 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
with the force of thousands of
hydrogen bombs.

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.601 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
A cloud of dust was raised which
blocked the sun for years.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:39.172 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
This marked the end of the
dinosaurs.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.842 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
According to conventional
scientific theory,

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:47.046 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
no human beings were alive then
to witness these events.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.249 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
Or were they?

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.117 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
Over 100 million years ago,

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.653 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the limestone bedrock of the
Paluxy River in Texas

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.055 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
was a muddy plain.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.758 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It was here that countless
dinosaurs left their footprints

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:02.529 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
to be fossilized and preserved
forever.

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:03.796 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
But the tracks of another
creature

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:06.165 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
have also been preserved in
these banks,

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.903 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
possibly the tracks of man.

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:12.939 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Archeologist Carl Baugh has led
the investigation

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:17.377 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
of these controversial prints
for over 12 years.

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
My reaction was one of shock.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:23.616 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
I had heard of human footprints
being found in this locale,

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.252 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
on the Paluxy near Glen Rose,
Texas,

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
but I was rather skeptical.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.858 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And here, after removing actual
rock layers,

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:36.529 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the team and I excavated a
series of dinosaur footprints.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
And 18 and one half inches

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.567 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
from one of those dinosaur
footprints,

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:46.072 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
we excavated a 16 inch human
footprint.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:50.877 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
We excavated 12 footprints in a
series.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:55.548 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And when you find a trail with
left, right, left, right

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.052 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
pacing stride, the right
distance apart,

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:03.690 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
then you have to interpret this
as belonging to humankind.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
It's been claimed that the
Paluxy River footprints

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.196 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
are a hoax, carved into the
limestone bedrock

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.865 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
as a tourist attraction.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:16.970 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Well, we found trails leading
under limestone ledges

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.139 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
and actually removed the
limestone ledges

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:23.876 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
one slab of rock at a time.

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.446 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And we found that both the
dinosaur footprints

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:28.414 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
and the trail of human
footprints

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:32.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
continued under the rock ledges.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:36.089 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
This evidence is real.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.792 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Today, many of these so-called
human prints

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:43.596 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
have fallen victim to erosion
and the hands of vandals.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.498 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
But Carl Baugh is in possession

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:48.901 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
of one of the most compelling
prints ever found.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:52.005 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
What you are about to see is the
most controversial artifact

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
in his collection.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.276 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
I first saw the Burdick Print on
my initial visit to Glen Rose

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.145 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:21%
in 1984.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:02.215 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
My impression at that time was
that it was too perfect.

00:13:02.215 --> 00:13:04.717 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
But it's clearly a human
footprint

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:08.788 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
demonstrating the heel section,
the arch,

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.592 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
the base of the metatarsals,

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:17.697 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the first, or, great toe, 2nd,
3rd, 4th and 5th toe.

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:19.365 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
After our examination of this
print,

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:24.203 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
we find that it definitely is in
the Cretaceous limestone,

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:27.674 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
in the same formation with the
dinosaur footprints.

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:29.475 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Here we're looking at a cross
section,

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.711 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and we can see very obvious
following contours

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.846 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
under the great toe,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.715 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
and actually structures under
each one

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:38.418 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
where we see the calcite
inclusion

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.987 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the force was concentrated and
produced these

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.322 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
load bearing structures which
are exactly what

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
geologists look for.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.161 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We have eliminated the idea that
it's carved,

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:53.499 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
it definitely is original
impression in the sediment.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.102 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
This is said to be the
fossilized finger

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.204 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
of a human being.

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
It too was reportedly found in
the same strata as the

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:05.478 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
dinosaur tracks, dating to over
a hundred million years old.

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
It had what appeared to be a
nail,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.753 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
what appeared to be a cuticle, a
taper... a humanoid shape.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:16.689 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
After I saw the CAT scan,

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:20.426 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
there was no longer any room in
my mind for doubt.

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:23.930 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
This scan shows the shape of the
finger,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
it shows tissue beneath the skin
of the finger.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.371 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It shows the bone, it shows the
joints, it shows a ligament.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.741 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
That tells me this is a human
finger.

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.312 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
The limestone lair that
preserved these artifacts

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:43.249 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
is reportedly dated at around
135 million years old,

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.351 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
yet as we saw earlier,

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.755 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
objects have been found in rock
strata much older than this.

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
In Klerksdorp, South Africa,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.026 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
hundreds of metallic spheres
were found by miners

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.895 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
in pre-Cambrian strata,

00:14:55.895 --> 00:15:02.068 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
said to be a fantastic 2.8
billion years old.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.604 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The controversy centers around
the fine groove

00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:06.606 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
encircling some of the spheres.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:08.741 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Lab technicians were at a loss
to explain

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:14.180 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
how they could have been formed
by any known natural process.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.984 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
According to the curator of the
Klerksdorp Museum, Rolfe Marx,

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:20.286 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
the spheres are a complete
mystery.

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.822 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
They look manmade, yet at the
time in Earth's history

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:25.124 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
when they came to rest on this
rock,

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
no intelligent life existed.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.829 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
They're like nothing I've ever
seen before.

Author/researcher David Hatcher
Childress

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.602 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
has written numerous articles on
the coexistence

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.939 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
of humans and dinosaurs.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.708 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
I think that one of the
solutions to

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.812 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the paradox of dinosaurs and
people together

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:48.548 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and the vast discrepancy in
time,

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:50.783 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the whole timeline of millions
of years

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.852 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
versus only thousands of years

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.087 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
can be explained in a
cataclysmically,

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:58.858 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
geological view of the past,

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:01.794 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
where rather than geological
events taking place

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.597 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
over millions of years, they
take place more quickly.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:07.466 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And what is a million years on a
geological timescale

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.936 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
is in fact only say a thousand
years.

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:11.804 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
And therefore it's going to
bring all this dating

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:16.475 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
much closer to us and make it
possible so that,

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:20.146 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
in a scientific way, man
and dinosaurs can

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.783 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
have existed together in the
past, and in fact,

00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:27.687 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
dinosaurs can still be alive
today in small numbers

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.956 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
in remote areas of the world.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:33.826 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
For instance, in 1977 a Japanese
fishing boat off New Zealand

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:38.197 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
brought up out of the water the
carcass of what appeared to be

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.433 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:33%
a plesiosaur,

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:44.537 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
an animal that should have been
extinct for millions of years.

00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:46.472 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Although the authenticity of
this photograph

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:49.141 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
has never been disproved,
skeptics have claimed

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:52.812 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
it's merely the body of a
decomposing shark.

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:56.282 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
We've seen a broad range of
evidence,

00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:58.384 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
some of it highly speculative,

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.586 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
but there are enough well
documented cases

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.556 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
to call for a closer look at the
conventional explanation

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:07.293 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
of man's origins -- the theory
of evolution.

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:12.098 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
England is the birthplace of
evolution's first champion,

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:15.935 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Charles Darwin. Darwin's theory
of evolution proposes that

00:17:15.935 --> 00:17:20.606 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
simple life forms or species
evolve into more complex species

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:24.543 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
by accidental changes over long
periods of time.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.446 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
For example, given 5 million
years,

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:31.884 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
an ape can evolve into a man.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.186 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Since Darwin's time, his theory
has become central

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:37.757 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
to our understanding of how man
came into existence.

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:41.794 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's almost universally accepted
today.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.931 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
But according to science
investigator Richard Milton,

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:47.233 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Darwin's theory of how man
evolved from the apes

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.303 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
has some critical problems.

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:53.506 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The building behind me is
London's Natural History Museum.

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:55.374 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It looks rather like a cathedral
or a church,

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:56.709 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and in a way that's what it is.

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:59.979 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
It's a kind of temple to
Darwin's theory of evolution.

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.917 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
People come to museums like the
Natural History Museum

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.385 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
to get answers to their
question,

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
have we evolved from apes?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.256 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Do humans and apes share a
common ancestor?

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.691 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And to look at an exhibit like
this,

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:13.926 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
you'd think that question had
been answered decisively, yes.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:17.196 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
But the answer is far from
decisive. In fact,

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:21.734 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
this representation is an
interpretation of the fossils.

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:23.669 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The interpretation of one group
of scientists.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:25.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
There are other interpretations,

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:26.906 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
but you won't find them in this
museum,

00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:29.742 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
or any other museum in the
world.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:31.744 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
In the model of the evolutionary
tree,

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:35.147 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
man and apes are said to share a
common ancestor.

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:39.518 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
However, evidence of that common
ancestor is highly contested.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.321 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
That's why it is still called
the missing link.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.293 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
When Darwin's theory of
evolution was embraced,

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.763 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
it was assumed that in the next
century enough fossil evidence

00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:54.834 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
would be found to prove that man
had evolved from the apes.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:56.702 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Darwinists had promised us a
missing link,

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.305 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
and so they've got to deliver,
they've got to come up with one.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.108 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Any missing link will do, it
seems.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.076 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Every so often a skeleton is
found in Africa.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's discoverers describe it as
being the missing link,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.117 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the headlines come and go, and
then later on, that skeleton,

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:15.554 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
those bones, are reclassified
either as human or as ape.

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:18.891 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
And so far, the missing link is
still missing.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.495 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
One of the most classic examples
of this

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
is the story of Java Man,

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:29.001 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
discovered by Eugene Dubois in
1892.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.904 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
Dubois discovered a very
primitive looking

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:35.875 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
ape-like skullcap, and he
discovered this thigh bone

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:39.178 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
about 40 feet away. He said,
well,

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.114 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
obviously they must belong to
the same creature,

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:46.152 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
and that creature walked erect
like a human being

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:49.755 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
and had an ape-like skull, so
that must be a missing link-

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.491 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
the Pithecanthropus ape man.

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.494 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So maybe you had a big ape and a
human being

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.597 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
living together in Java about a
million years ago.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
The important point to make
about the Java Man discovery

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.205 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
is that it's based on a
speculative leap

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.574 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
in which two pieces of evidence
are put together in a way

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:11.277 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
that's not really warranted.

00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:14.613 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
At the end of his life, Dubois
realized that the skullcap

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:18.951 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
belonged to a large ape, and the
leg bone was from a man.

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:21.787 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Nevertheless, Java Man was
prominently displayed

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:26.158 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
at the Museum of Natural History
in New York until 1984.

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:29.728 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Since then it has been removed.

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.264 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Today museums all over the world
display models

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.101 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
of yet another skeleton they
called the missing link --

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:38.604 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
the common ancestor of both man
and ape.

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:42.141 align:start line:79% position:17% size:43%
Lucy, the famous
Australopithecine

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:45.511 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
discovered by Donald Johanson.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.881 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He says she was very human-like,
but I was at

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.218 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
a conference of anthropologists
where many of them

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
were making a case that she was

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.023 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
hardly distinguishable from an
ape or a monkey.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:02.128 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
These bones have been restored
to resemble a missing link --

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:03.696 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
part human, part ape.

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:06.732 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And Lucy is now thought of as
being our long lost ancestor.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.734 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
But this is merely an
interpretation,

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:12.037 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
an interpretation of one group.
Those same bones can be,

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.873 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and they have been, taken by
scientists

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:16.609 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and identified as simply an
extinct ape.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:20.045 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
Nothing to do with us at all.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.982 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Newspapers are constantly
reporting new discoveries

00:21:22.982 --> 00:21:26.652 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
that add to our understanding of
man's origins, but so far,

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:32.124 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
conclusive evidence of the
missing link has not been found.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.593 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
So what happens to the
evolutionary model if the

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:38.097 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
missing link does not exist at
all?

00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:39.732 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Without it there's little
support for man's connection

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:44.436 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
to the apes, and the model
simply collapses.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:48.407 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Some people have said to me, how
can you criticize the theory if

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.743 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
you can't... if you don't have
something to replace it with?

00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:52.111 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
Well, I don't accept that.

00:21:52.111 --> 00:21:54.013 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
If the emperor hasn't got any
clothes on,

00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:56.682 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
then the emperor hasn't got any
clothes on. It's not my fault.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.751 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It seems to me that if Darwinism
is wrong,

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.253 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
then somebody has got to point
the finger.

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:07.993 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Next we will visit the
mysterious city of Tiwanaku,

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:11.197 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
built at an altitude of 12 and a
half thousand feet,

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.733 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
with stones weighing 150 tons.

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:17.636 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
This could be the oldest city in
the world,

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:21.006 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
built by a civilization as yet
unknown.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.444 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
In order to unravel the mystery
of man's origins,

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:28.280 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
we must follow the path of
civilization,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.016 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Now, civilization is said to
have spread from the old world

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.818 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
to the new world.

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:34.987 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
But there is evidence that
humans were building cities

00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:40.893 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
in the new world thousands of
years before history tells us.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:43.529 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Traditionally the oldest city in
the world is thought to be

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:47.833 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Jerico in the old world, dated
to around 8,000 BC.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.769 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Yet in South America, the
so-called new world,

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.339 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
scientists are looking at
evidence of a city

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.943 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
that could be twice as old.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:00.713 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Situated at an altitude of 12
and a half thousand feet,

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:06.785 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Tiwanaku is one of the most
mysterious cities in the world.

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.754 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Traditionally, it's thought to
have been built

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:14.059 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
by the predecessors of the Incas
2,000 years ago.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.995 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
However, around the turn of the
century,

00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:20.032 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Bolivian scholar Arthur
Posnansky began a 50 year study

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:23.936 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the ruins of Tiwanaku. Using
the science of astonomy,

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:27.740 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Posnansky came to an amazing
conclusion.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.409 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
He calculated that Tiwanaku had
been constructed

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:33.746 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
more than 17,000 years ago,

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.915 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
long before any civilization was
supposed to have existed.

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:54.833 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Posnansky called this fabulous
city the cradle of civilization.

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.703 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Even though the accuracy of
Posnansky's measurements

00:23:57.703 --> 00:23:59.872 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
were confirmed by engineers,

00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:03.142 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
his conclusions about the age of
Tiwanaku

00:24:03.142 --> 00:24:05.077 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
have never been accepted.

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:08.547 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Neil Steede, a Mesoamerican
archeologist

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:13.085 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
decided to reopen this
controversial investigation.

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:16.455 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
I met with Dr. Oswaldo Rivera,

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.357 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
who is head of Bolivian
Archeology.

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:23.962 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The doctor, though he disagrees
with Posnansky's findings,

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:27.499 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
was more than willing to help in
every way possible

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
so that we could retrace
Posnansky's steps.

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:37.509 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Neil visited Dr. Rivera's newest
excavation site,

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:40.179 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
the Acapana Pyramid.

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:41.613 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
Today, it's mostly ruins,

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.749 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
but the base is miraculously
preserved,

00:24:43.749 --> 00:24:46.518 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
and still testifies to the
advanced capability

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.787 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
of its builders.

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:54.560 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The facing stones of this site
are perfectly set

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.697 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
with no mortar. We took a
needle, and that needle

00:24:58.697 --> 00:25:01.767 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
we tried to insert at every
point along the joint,

00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:09.675 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
and the needle couldn't be
inserted. A perfect cut.

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:12.211 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
One of the most baffling
questions for Posnansky

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:16.014 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
was why they build Tiwanaku with
such precision. This, he felt,

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:19.918 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
was an important clue to the age
of the structure.

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:23.522 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Now, the ancients constructed
the site with

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:26.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
astromonical alignments in mind.

00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:32.164 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
As the sun rises, each day it
moves along the horizon,

00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:35.934 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and arises in a different spot.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:40.105 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
To measure this movement they
built the temple itself

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:42.274 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
as a giant clock,

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:47.212 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
to tell them how the progression
of the sun was proceeding.

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:51.150 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
And we can use those same
astronomical alignments

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.153 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
to date the site.

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:56.789 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Posnansky observed that on the
first day of spring

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:59.224 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
the sun rose exactly in the
center of the temple

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
through the archway.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.795 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
Based on the layout of the
temple he deduced

00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:05.798 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
that on the first days of winter
and summer, the sun

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.801 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
should rise directly over
each of the huge cornerstones.

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:11.804 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
But he found this was not the
case.

00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:15.107 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The position of the sun was for
some reason slightly outside

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:17.342 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
of the corner markers.

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:20.045 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
He wondered what that reason
was.

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:26.118 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
In Tiwanaku, and in the other
ancient sites surrounding it,

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:29.755 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
the architecture is perfectly
aligned to the cardinal points.

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:33.325 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The buildings are deliberately
oriented to the cardinal points.

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:37.930 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
But if we measure each building
precisely, we will find errors.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.567 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
I believe these are simple
errors of construction,

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
not at all related to the date
of construction.

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:51.910 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
After observing the perfection
with which this site is built

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:59.251 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
with 100 ton stones, to suggest
that such things as

00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:05.724 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
the solstice markers are
misaligned, I find incredible.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:09.027 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
No, I think the solstice markers
were probably

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:13.866 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
very precisely located, as
everything else in the site.

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:18.670 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
And in fact this is the very
argument that Posnansky used

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.073 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
to calculate the antiquity of
the site.

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.576 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
By measuring the angle of the
cornerstones

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and comparing that angle to
today's sunrise position,

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:30.249 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Posnansky was able to calculate
that Tiwanaku was built

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:34.453 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
17,000 years ago.

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:36.488 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
At that time the tilt of the
Earth's axis

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.424 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
was slightly different than it
is today,

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
so the summer and winter suns
would have risen

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.731 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
directly above the ancient
cornerstones.

00:27:45.731 --> 00:27:49.067 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The only correction that I would
make is that we now have

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:54.673 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
better astronomical measurements
due to satellites and computers.

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:58.110 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
And I would suspect the date
would be more like

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.346 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
12,000 years ago.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.982 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
But that still makes Tiwanaku

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:08.153 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
the oldest city known on the
face of the Earth.

00:28:10.923 --> 00:28:14.026 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
In his chronicles of Peru,
written in the 1600's,

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:17.362 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Garcia De La Vega wrote that
when the Spanish first arrived

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.464 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
in South America they asked the
Incas,

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:22.634 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
"Who built this incredible city
of Tiwanaku?

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:26.505 align:start line:79% position:20% size:50%
"Did you build it?"
The Inca said, "No."

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In fact, they laughed at the
idea. 

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.209 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
They said, "We had nothing
to do with it.

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:35.213 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
"This was built thousands
of years before our time."

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.721 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The current view says that man
arrived in South America

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:46.758 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
around 15,000 years ago, a
wandering hunter-gatherer.

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:49.494 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Yet the evidence we've seen
suggests that

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:53.332 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Tiwanaku was designed by an
advanced civilization.

00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:57.703 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
A chance discovery revealed just
how advanced they may have been.

00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:01.707 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
While restoring the ancient
Temple at Pumapunka,

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:04.977 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Dr. Rivera and his team
discovered a long-lost secret

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:07.946 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
of the ancient builders. They
found a strange depression

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:11.483 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
between two blocks of stone.
Upon clearing out the debris,

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:16.221 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
they noticed the unmistakable
glint of metal.

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:20.726 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Whoever built Tiwanaku came up
with a very ingenious method

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:24.262 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
for holding together the huge
stones

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.665 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
which they used to build the
site.

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:29.501 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
They carved a groove in the
edge,

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:33.438 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
and into this groove they would
pour a molten alloy

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:37.809 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
which later hardened into a
staple.

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:42.814 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
What I find amazing here is that
to move to each site

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:47.019 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
where the staple was needed,
they had to have something like

00:29:47.019 --> 00:29:51.223 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
a portable smelting plant to
maintain this metal

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:53.725 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
in a molten state.

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:56.962 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Mysterious metal clamps reveal
the level of technology

00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:59.998 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
far beyond their time.

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:04.403 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
The antiquity and the
technological sophistication of

00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:09.708 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Tiwanaku should make each and
every one of us fully question

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:13.345 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
the origins of civilization.

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:21.920 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Where did the ancient Tiwanakans
learn this complex process?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.090 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
The answer may lie halfway
around the world

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.160 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
at one of man's most mysterious
monuments --

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.662 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:37.869 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Is it possible that there was an
advanced civilization

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:41.707 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
on this planet thousands of
years before history tells us?

00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:43.809 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Investigative journalist Graham
Hancock

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:46.445 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
considers this to be a very real
possibility.

00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.847 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
He's dedicated 9 years of his
life

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:51.016 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
to tracking down the evidence.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.754 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
This monument is one of a
category of monuments

00:30:55.754 --> 00:30:57.956 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
from all over the world.

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.692 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
These monuments have certain
things in common.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:04.029 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
First and foremost, enormous
blocks of stone,

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:06.364 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
gigantic, weighing hundreds of
tons.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:08.366 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
Secondly, very precise,

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:11.136 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
scientific astronomical
alignments.

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:14.806 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
And thirdly, the greatest
mystery of all,

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:20.245 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
we don't know who built these
monuments.

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:23.482 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Hancock points to a number of
sites throughout the world

00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:26.017 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
which exhibit gigantic stone
construction.

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:29.855 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
This is called megalithic
architecture.

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:32.557 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
The immense fortress at
Saksaywaman in Peru

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.227 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
is comprised of individual
granite stones,

00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.996 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
some weighing 360 tons.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:42.601 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
That's the equivalent of two
diesel locomotives.

00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:45.670 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The Osireion in Egypt is made of
tremendous pillars of

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:50.575 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
red Aswan granite, some of which
weigh over 100 tons.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.879 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
My own view is that what we're
looking at here

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:59.684 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
is a common influence that
touched all of these places

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.988 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
long before recorded history
began.

00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:05.757 align:start line:79% position:21% size:53%
A remote, third party
civilization

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.894 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
unidentified by historians that
had a presence in Mexico,

00:32:08.894 --> 00:32:11.763 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
that had a presence in South
America,

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:14.466 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
that had a presence in Egypt,
and elsewhere.

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:17.602 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And that left behind a legacy of
knowledge

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.105 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
in all of those places.

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:26.845 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
In 1993, an independent
Egyptologist, John Anthony West,

00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:29.581 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
shocked the world with
geological evidence

00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:35.153 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
that the Sphinx in Egypt could
be 12,000 years old.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.556 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Recently, astronomer-engineer
Robert Bauval,

00:32:37.556 --> 00:32:40.058 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
using a computer model of the
Giza Plateau

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:43.295 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
made a startling discovery which
seems to confirm

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:46.231 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
this ancient age of the Sphinx.

00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:49.534 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
In very simple terms, the first
thing that one realizes

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:52.070 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
when you look at the pyramids of
Giza

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:56.107 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
is that they're designed along
astronomical principles.

00:32:56.107 --> 00:33:00.545 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We're finding that the astronomy
is leading us to conclude

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:04.216 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
that the Sphinx was erected in
10,500 BC.

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:07.052 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:61%
And this matches exactly

00:33:07.052 --> 00:33:09.654 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
with the ideas that have been
developed

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.858 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
in the geological analysis of
the Sphinx.

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:16.795 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
So there are two hard sciences
now indicating that the Sphinx

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:20.599 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
could be very, very old, and

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:24.769 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
going back to the 11th
millennium BC.

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.671 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
According to Graham Hancock,

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:29.708 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
if Tiwanaku and the Sphinx were
both built around

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:32.844 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
12,000 years ago, they may have
had a common source.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:37.382 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Consider these similarities
between the Americas and Egypt.

00:33:39.184 --> 00:33:40.986 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
Both had huge pyramids,

00:33:40.986 --> 00:33:43.688 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
precisely aligned to the
cardinal points.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:46.825 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
Temples with megalithic stones

00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:52.097 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
with extremely fine joints of
less than a 50th of an inch.

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:55.166 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Both Egypt and the Americas used
royal headdresses

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.035 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
of similar style.

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:59.204 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Both employed a unique style of
construction

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
using 'L' shaped corners.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.708 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Both used the same style of
metal clamps

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.844 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
to hold huge stones in place.

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:09.381 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And both cultures used the
process of mummification

00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:12.751 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
to preserve and honor their
dead.

00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:15.854 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
These compelling similarities
between Egypt and the Americas

00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:19.324 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
suggest to some that a
sophisticated group of seafaring

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:21.293 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
people crossed the Atlantic

00:34:21.293 --> 00:34:24.529 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
thousands of years before
Columbus.

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.364 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
A collection of ancient maps
suggests

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
they may have had a knowledge of
the world

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.236 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
which has never been explained.

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:32.771 align:middle line:85% position:13% size:21%
In 1929,

00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:36.207 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
rolled up on a dusty shelf in a
library in Constantinople

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:39.177 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
in Turkey, a map was found.

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:43.081 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
This map had been drawn in 1513
by a Turkish Admiral,

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
Admiral Piri Reis.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.286 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The strange thing about this map
is

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:51.790 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
it shows features of the earth
that nobody in 1513

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.826 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
should have been able to know.

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:57.862 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Before the 18th century, sailors
ran the risk of

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.498 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
crashing their ships onto rocky
coastlines

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
because they lacked one thing --

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.869 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
the ability to calculate
longitude.

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:07.939 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
For that you need an extremely
accurate clock.

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:12.777 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It wasn't until 1790 that the
first accurate marine timepiece

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:16.014 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
was invented, and sailors could
pinpoint their position

00:35:16.014 --> 00:35:19.384 align:middle line:85% position:14% size:31%
on the seas.

00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:22.687 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Yet 250 years before this clock
was made,

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:25.924 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Piri Reis had drawn a map which
showed the coastlines of

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:30.528 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Africa and South America within
half a degree of longitude.

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:32.864 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And as Piri Reis himself told
us,

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:35.033 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that knowledge was not his
knowledge,

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:37.369 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
it was knowledge that he'd
borrowed and copied

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:40.271 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
from earlier maps.

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:44.242 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And he stated on the map that it
was based on more than

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:49.447 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
20 source maps, and that some of
these maps went back to the time

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:51.683 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
of Alexander the Great, or even
earlier.

00:35:51.683 --> 00:35:54.819 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
In other words, to before the
time of Christ.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:58.757 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
So the mystery is where did
these source maps come from?

00:35:58.757 --> 00:36:03.695 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Who charted the globe long ages
ago with an accuracy

00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:07.665 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
that we ourselves can hardly
match today?

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:11.336 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
A professor of science, a
Charles Hapgood,

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:14.506 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
was combing through the map room
at the Library of Congress

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:16.741 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
when he made a startling
discovery.

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:20.145 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
As my eyes fell upon the
southern hemisphere

00:36:20.145 --> 00:36:24.916 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
of a world map drawn by Oronteus
Finaeus in 1532,

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.053 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
I had the instant conviction
that I had found here

00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:32.290 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
a truly authentic map of the
real Antarctica.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:37.195 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
And the mystery of this map is

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.097 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
it shows Antarctica as it looks
under the ice long before

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:40.665 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Antarctica is even supposed to
have been discovered.

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.700 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And perhaps the greatest mystery
of all

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.704 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
is that it shows the Antarctic
Peninsula not as it looks today,

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.940 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
covered by more than a mile of
ice,

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.478 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
but as it actually looks
underneath that covering of ice.

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:55.313 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Now, we ourselves have only
known what the land

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:59.184 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
under the Antarctic Peninsula
really looks like since 1958,

00:36:59.184 --> 00:37:01.853 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
when seismic surveys were taken
across the icecap.

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.824 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Hapgood put his theory to the
test.

00:37:05.824 --> 00:37:09.227 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
He compared the Oronteus Finaeus
map with the map of Antarctica

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.596 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
as it looks covered with ice.

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:13.731 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
The maps were similar,

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.668 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
but details of the coastline
were obscured by the ice.

00:37:16.668 --> 00:37:19.370 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Then, using a map created by
seismographic survey

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.807 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
he was able to compare the
actual coastlines of Antarctica

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:26.211 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
with the Oronteus Finaeus map.

00:37:26.211 --> 00:37:30.882 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
When the maps were overlaid, the
similarities astounded him.

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:33.785 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The clearest deduction of all is
that whoever drew up

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:37.422 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
those original source maps
thousands of years ago

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:40.725 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
had a level of technology as
high as our own.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:44.462 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
They had explored the whole
globe from north to south

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
and from east to west.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.667 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
So this is testimony of an
advanced and as yet unidentified

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.770 align:start line:79% position:22% size:56%
civilization in remote
pre-history.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.110 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
A wooly mammoth was frozen so
quickly that it's

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.947 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
last meal of buttercups remained
fresh in it's stomach

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.016 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
for thousands of years.

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.152 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
But this sudden drop in
temperature may be a clue

00:38:07.152 --> 00:38:09.954 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
to the disappearance of the
unidentified civilization

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:13.358 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
Plato called Atlantis.

00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:17.061 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
If a technologically advanced
culture did live on the earth

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:21.065 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
thousands of years ago, what
happened to them?

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.835 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
The Greek philosopher, Plato,
described an advanced

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:28.540 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
civilization whose legend was
preserved by Egyptian priests.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.041 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
As the story goes,

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:33.645 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Atlantis was a great empire of
engineers and scientists

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:36.414 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
who were, in many ways, more
technologically advanced

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:38.116 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
than we are today.

00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
It was destroyed 12,000 years
ago by floods and earthquakes,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.658 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
forcing it's survivors to seek
refuge all over the world.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:52.063 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
For centuries, scientists and
explorers have searched in vain

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:55.633 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
for a continent that fits
Plato's description of Atlantis.

00:38:55.633 --> 00:39:00.438 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
So far, no sign of this vast
island empire has been found.

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:04.075 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
Some say it sank into the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:07.478 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Others say it was destroyed by
the volcanic eruption of Thera

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:09.347 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
in the Mediterranean.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:12.917 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
But researcher Rand Flem-Ath
believes he's found a location

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:15.587 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
that no one else has ever
considered.

00:39:15.587 --> 00:39:20.825 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Atlantis, he says, is buried
under two miles of ice.

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:24.529 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
Up until now the search for
Atlantis has been restricted

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:27.265 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
to two bodies of water -- the
Mediterranean Sea,

00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:28.967 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
and the North Atlantic.

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:32.804 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
But Atlantis is said to have
been in the real ocean.

00:39:32.804 --> 00:39:36.841 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
And we now understand that the
world has only one ocean,

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.810 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:41%
the world ocean.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.113 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
In the middle of that ocean is
Antarctica.

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.748 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It's right smack in the middle.

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:44.949 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
And this is where we believe
that the mapping of the earth

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
took place. It's most famously
known as Atlantis.

00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:53.791 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Today, Antarctica is a frozen
wasteland,

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:56.928 align:start line:79% position:25% size:61%
virtually uninhabitable.
According to geologists,

00:39:56.928 --> 00:40:01.532 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
it's been buried under ice for
almost 2 million years.

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:04.102 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
How could any civilization have
thrived there

00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:06.704 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
only 12,000 years ago?

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:11.609 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
A surprising discovery in
Siberia may hold the answer.

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:14.345 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
In 1977, a Russian bulldozer
operator

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:19.550 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
noticed a block of muddy ice
containing a curious dark mass.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.587 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
On closer inspection, he was
amazed to see

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:25.590 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
the contours of a small
elephant-like creature.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.926 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
He had discovered a perfectly
preserved wooly mammoth.

00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:34.565 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
In a kind of zone of death, all
over the northern hemisphere --

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.768 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
northern Siberia, northern
Canada,

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:39.537 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
we find the frozen carcasses of
hundreds of thousands

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.006 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
of large mammal species, mainly
mammoths,

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:45.043 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
but also wooly rhinos and other
creatures of this kind.

00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:48.579 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
And when their stomach contents
are examined, as they have been,

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.115 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
they are found to have been
grazing on warm weather

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.118 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
vegetation, and yet they're now
positioned extremely close

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:58.790 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
to the North Pole. The only
theory which really explains

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.526 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
this mystery is the theory of
crustal displacement.

00:41:01.526 --> 00:41:04.762 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
That the land that they were on
was shoved into

00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:07.165 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
a much colder climate very
suddenly.

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:12.203 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Professor Charles Hapgood was
fascinated by the fact that

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:15.206 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
thousands of animals could be
frozen completely in a brief

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:20.044 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
moment in geological time, and
that ancient maps of Antarctica

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:23.781 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
suggest that it too was frozen
over very quickly.

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:27.251 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
For Hapgood, this could only be
explained in one way.

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:30.221 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
That entire continents could
rapidly change positions

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:33.224 align:middle line:85% position:15% size:35%
on the planet.

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:58%
About 12,000 years ago,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.395 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
there was a displacement of the
earth's crust.

00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:40.832 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
The entire outer shell of the
earth moved

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:42.934 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
something like 2,000 miles.

00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:45.570 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
And when the earth's crust
shifted,

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.807 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
all of Antarctica is
encapsulated by the polar zone,

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:52.810 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
and at the same time, North
America is released

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.714 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
from the Arctic Circle, and
becomes temperate.

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:59.150 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
So we have ice melting in North
America,

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
ice forming in Antarctica.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.790 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
When professor Hapgood first
proposed this theory

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.127 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
it was met with silence from the
scientific community,

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:12.630 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
with one notable exception. Dr.
Albert Einstein.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.768 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
"I find your arguments very
impressive,

00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:21.005 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
"and have the impression that
your hypothesis is correct.

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:24.175 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
"One can hardly doubt that
significant shifts of

00:42:24.175 --> 00:42:27.512 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
"the crust of the earth have
taken place repeatedly,

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:30.848 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
"and within a short time."

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:34.786 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
This controversial theory is
based on a well-accepted fact.

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:38.289 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The individual continents have
been slowly drifting apart

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:40.925 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:56%
for millions of years.

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:44.629 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is possible because the
outer crust of the earth floats

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:48.833 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
upon a semi-liquid layer.
Hapgood's theory of

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:52.203 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
crustal displacement takes this
principle one step further.

00:42:52.203 --> 00:42:55.072 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
It states that the entire crust
of the earth can shift

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:59.944 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
in one piece, like the loose
skin of an orange.

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:03.581 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Hapgood documented three earth
crust displacements

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.983 align:middle line:85% position:29% size:65%
in the last 100,000 years.

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:10.621 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
We believe that they happen
every 41,000 years.

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.157 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The last one happened 11 and a
half thousand years ago, so

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:16.327 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
we're not due for another earth
crust displacement for

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:20.264 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
29 and a half thousand years.

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.899 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
According to Hapgood's theory,

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:25.203 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
this cataclysmic shift is caused
by an imbalance of ice

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.672 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
on the polar caps.

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:30.007 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Over time, ice builds up at the
poles,

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:33.911 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
reaching as much as two miles in
thickness.

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:36.681 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The tremendous weight of the ice
causes an imbalance

00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.984 align:middle line:85% position:36% size:73%
on the globe. The ice shifts,

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:43.054 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
dragging the outer crust and the
continents in one piece

00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:46.123 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:43%
to new positions.

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.226 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
The polar caps are now in a
warmer climate,

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.027 align:middle line:85% position:27% size:63%
where they begin to melt,

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:52.730 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
while temperate lands are in the
polar regions

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.867 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
where they freeze and build up
ice.

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:58.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
If Hapgood's theory is possible,

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:02.673 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
and land masses can suddenly
shift 2000 miles,

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:05.643 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
it might explain how an entire
continent and its people

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:09.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
could have been lost to history.

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:85% position:40% size:75%
I am convinced by the evidence

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
that we are a species with
amnesia.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.589 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
We have forgotten something of
great importance

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:21.626 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:45%
from our own past.

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:24.662 align:start line:79% position:27% size:63%
When we recover it, we'll
realize, for a start,

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:28.366 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
that our civilization isn't the
apex of creation.

00:44:28.366 --> 00:44:30.468 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
It isn't the pinnacle towards
which

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:31.802 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
everything has been building

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:34.539 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
throughout all of geological
time.

00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:37.441 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
Rather it's part of an up and
down, a flow,

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.944 align:start line:79% position:24% size:58%
and it's possible for a
civilization to reach

00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:44.215 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
a very high level of advancement
and be wiped out.

00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:46.350 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
This is something we've never
really confronted,

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.488 align:middle line:85% position:31% size:68%
and we need to confront it.

00:44:50.488 --> 00:44:53.224 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
We've met the experts and looked
at the evidence

00:44:53.224 --> 00:44:56.093 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
that seems to contradict our
conventional theories

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.828 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:53%
about the human race.

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:00.765 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Numerous artifacts indicate to
some scientists that

00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:03.534 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
man could be millions of years
old,

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:06.671 align:start line:79% position:29% size:65%
throwing into question our
descent from the apes.

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:09.774 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
Ancient maps and megalithic
architecture suggest that

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:14.011 align:start line:79% position:33% size:70%
an advanced culture may have
existed 12,000 years ago --

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
their homeland wiped out by a
cataclysm

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.150 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
that rearranged the entire face
of the planet.

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:24.655 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's been said that man has made
the climb

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:28.626 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
from stone age to civilization
more than once,

00:45:28.626 --> 00:45:31.662 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
and that our present time is
just the latest in this cycle.

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.198 align:start line:79% position:31% size:68%
But only if the evidence is
allowed to speak for itself

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:35.633 align:middle line:85% position:33% size:70%
will we ever learn the truth

00:45:35.633 --> 00:45:38.169 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
about the mysterious origins of
man.
