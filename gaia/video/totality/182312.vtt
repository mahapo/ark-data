00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to see this.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you see this?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Did you see this?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:90%
This is so cool.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just a
pulsating thing.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wispy flower effect.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I was just thrilled.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like the Pac-Man
coming and taking these little

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:90%
bites.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> This is not a normal thing.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
you see every day.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Something very strange,
very unusual, is happening.

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The animals were freaking out
because they didn't know what

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though we all knew
exactly what was going

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to happen, to see it in real
life was just unbelievable.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:10%
>> There is nothing
like a total eclipse.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It is the most mind-boggling
thing you're ever going to see

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:10%
in nature.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>> There are not many things
that a person sees in his

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:10%
lifetime that are as singular
as a total solar eclipse.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Incredible sense of awe.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:10%
>> And all these people
started arriving and setting up

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:10%
telescopes, every kind of
scientific gadget you could

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:10%
imagine.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well,
this is interesting.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The Earth is really fortunate
to be able to see an eclipse.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
There is not the
geometry for a person

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:84%
to witness a total solar
eclipse on any other planet

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Earth's moon is-- even though
400 times smaller than the sun,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
it's 400 times closer.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that geometry
allows us to witness

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:90%
a total solar eclipse.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And you get to really feel
this ethereal effect of having

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:10%
the sun go dark in
the middle of the day.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>> A solar eclipse only
happens at new moon phase.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's when the new
moon goes directly

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:10%
in front of the disc of the
sun and casts its shadow

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:10%
onto the surface of the Earth,
and effectively blocks out

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:10%
the sunlight for a
short period of time.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The new moon is when
the side facing the earth,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
the near side, is not
illuminated by the sun.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
The only part of the
moon that's illuminated

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
by the sun at new moon is
the far side of the moon.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's a new moon
every single month,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
so why don't we see an
eclipse every month?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's because the
orbit of the moon is tilted

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
or inclined compared to the
Earth's orbit around the sun.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes the moon passes
above the sun in the sky,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it passes
below the sun in the sky.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So if the new moon is below the
sun, we won't get an eclipse.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Only when the orbit of the
moon lines up with the orbit

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth in
the new moon phase,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to get to
have a total solar eclipse.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:10%
>> We actually get a total
eclipse about once every one

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:10%
to two years, but they're
only visible from a very small

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:10%
fraction of the Earth's surface.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Now it's not always
a total solar eclipse,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:10%
because sometimes the moon is
a little bit farther away from

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:10%
the Earth, and so you'll
get what's called an annular

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:10%
eclipse, which is when we
have a ring around the edge

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:10%
of the moon.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the sun still
peeks its way around the moon.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is because our orbits
are not perfectly circular.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We are actually
elliptical orbits,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
so the Earth is a
little off-center.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
That means there are times
when the moon is a bit closer

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, and there
are times when the moon is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:90%
a bit farther from the Earth.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
This changes how big
the moon appears to us.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And when the moon's a
little too far away,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
it appears a little too small.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it does not block
the entire face of the sun.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you'll have a ring
around it or an annulus.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's referred
to as a ring of fire.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But the interesting thing
is that our moon is very slowly

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
drifting away from the Earth
at about a rate of one inch per

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So that means, if
human beings are still

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
living on this planet hundreds
of thousands of years from now,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
they won't get to see
a total solar eclipse.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
They will only get to
see an annular eclipse.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So because of this changing
in distance with the moon,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
up until this point human
history has been pretty lucky.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:10%
The moon has appeared as big
as or bigger than the sun

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:10%
and allowed a total
blocking of that sunlight.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:10%
So it's a very
magical time for us.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:10%
We need to keep observing these
total eclipses as long as we

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:10%
can, recording the
data and the images

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:10%
that we get from them
really for posterity, so

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:10%
that the future can
see what we used

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:10%
to observe here in the past.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There were things about
the solar eclipse that really

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:90%
surprised me.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>> About 15 to 20
minutes before totality,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
the light became unlike
anything I'd ever seen before.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>> As the sun becomes more
obscured and the light is more

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:10%
of a narrow focused light, the
shadows all around you will

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:10%
become much more
defined, much more crisp.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The light streaming through
the leaves on a tree will

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:10%
produce crescent images of
the sun on the ground below

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:10%
the tree during all the
partial phases of the eclipse,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of them, as light
goes through those really small

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:10%
spaces.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I took a picture of the
ground underneath a tree.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The spaces between the leaves
were acting like little pinhole

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
cameras, and there
were just a number

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:90%
of those images on the ground.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So something that's fun to
do also is to look for something

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that will block the light and
still allow points of light

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
to go through it.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything with small
holes in it will work.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Colanders will create
beautiful patterns.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> A strainer-type spoon
with circular holes.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> A button, a Ritz
cracker, straw hats,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
anything that will allow some
light to come through but still

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.865 align:middle line:84%
cast a shadow, will be a fun
way to watch the progress

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:20.665 align:middle line:90%
of the eclipse.

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:29.198 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.198 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Even before totality, you'll
notice that there is a change

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
in temperature.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt the
temperature change.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You can expect the
temperature to drop anywhere

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
from 10 to 15 degrees
when it is in totality.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The animals notice that
the light is decreasing

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and many of them will
change their behavior.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Chickens may decide
to go back to roost.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Cows may bed down.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Crickets may start chirping.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Birds oftentimes stop singing,
unless it's a night bird.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So an owl might start hooting.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
animals around you,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to
what they're doing.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are all kinds of
phenomena to watch for that

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
aren't actually part of the
eclipse but kind of an effect

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
of the eclipse.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.855 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:10.655 align:middle line:90%
>> One minute.

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Shadow bands are caused by
the focused light from our sun

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:10%
coming through our atmosphere.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And our atmosphere
is like a fluid,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:10%
and so it is
refracting the light.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why they appear
like ripples on the ground.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Our atmosphere acts like
a fluid just like the water

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in a swimming pool.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever stood next
to an outdoor swimming pool

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.403 align:middle line:84%
during the daytime,
you'll notice

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that at the bottom
of the pool you

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
can see shadows and
bright bands moving

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
as the surface of
the water moves.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
with our atmosphere.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Our atmosphere is
constantly moving,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
so there's areas where the
air is a little more dense,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
some places where it's
a little less dense.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we see
brightness, and we also

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:90%
see those contrasting shadows.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very similar to
the effect when you look up

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
to a very bright star and our
atmosphere causes the star

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:90%
to twinkle.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also get to see
some interesting nuances like

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
the Baily's beads, which occur
because the lunar surface is

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:90%
not perfectly smooth.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The moon has
mountains and valleys,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and when the solar light tries
to bend its way past the moon,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:84%
naturally some of the
mountains will block that light

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and some light will make its
way through between the valleys.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Baily's beads is a phenomenon
discovered by Francis Baily

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
in the 1800s, where he was
observing a solar eclipse

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed the last sunlight
right before totality is

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
streaming between the mountain
peaks on the edge of the moon.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And to him they looked like
a string of bright beads,

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and the name stuck.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we see that,
we're seeing the last rays

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of sunlight pouring between
the mountain peaks and valleys

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:10%
And they're only
visible right before

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:10%
and right after totality,
and they're only

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:10%
visible for a few seconds.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And we see that last
little bit of light

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
just as we would see a
sunset between mountain peaks

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my God.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:10%
That's Baily's beads.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:10%
That's what they're
talking about.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the diamond
was gorgeous.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:90%
It just exploded.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And when there is only
one bead of light left,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:90%
that's called the diamond ring.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Something called the
diamond ring effect occurs.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
This is an interesting
side effect

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of the behavior of light,
the fact that light

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
behaves as a wave as
well as a particle

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and can therefore
bend around objects.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, the
light of the photossphere

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
tries to bend its
way around the moon

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and gets concentrated
in a small area.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we concentrate
light, we call that a laser.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so very truly, the
diamond ring effect

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.777 align:middle line:90%
is a natural-born laser.

00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now about the
time that disappears,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:84%
you might have the opportunity
to see the chromosphere.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It appears pink or
magenta in color,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
which is the next layer
of the sun's atmosphere.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The chromosphere is the
colored layer right above

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the sun.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:90%
It appears kind of pink.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a layer of the sun
that we don't normally

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.617 align:middle line:10%
see except during a
total solar eclipse.

00:10:46.617 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that part
of the atmosphere,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
you will also be able to see,
if you're lucky, a prominence.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Or solar flares, gaseous
material that's erupted off

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the sun.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
You can normally see
this with a special kind

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of solar telescope, but
during a total solar eclipse,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.518 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
them with the naked eye.

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that made
it stunning, really,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
were the prominences.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I had heard that the
corona was beautiful,

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
but the prominences
were just so--

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
the color in them was
just so otherworldly.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It was such a vivid
pink color, and I'm not

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
used to seeing those
colors in everyday life.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not used to
seeing them in nature.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We get to see the colors
of light that those atoms emit

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:90%
or glow.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
They're mostly
hydrogen and helium.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They tend to glow a lot
in the pink and the red.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:10%
And this gives the chromosphere
a pinkish color to it,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:10%
and this is why it's
called the chromosphere.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Once the diamond
ring effect passes,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:90%
that's when totality kicks in.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And totality is pretty
memorable for multiple reasons.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We get to see the corona, the
outermost layer of the sun.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When the sun actually
disappears and you see

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
the corona, which is something
you just can't see any other

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
way or any other
time, it's magic.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I can't believe it's
been up there all that time

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and I've just never
seen it before.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The corona was amazing.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It was this wispy
blue surrounding

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:90%
this dark hole in the sky.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the corona has a lot
of characteristics to it.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And those characteristics are
very important to witness.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there
are spikes, loops.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What we see going on in the
corona is very much dependent

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
on the magnetic
field of the sun.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field of the sun
is a very active, very dynamic

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's putting out gas and
charged particles and things

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
like got it into space.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And that changes what
that outer atmosphere,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that corona of the sun will
look like, its shape, how far

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
out from the moon it goes.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So what we see may be different
for every single eclipse.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen six
eclipses, you may

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
see the corona looks
six different ways.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
You might get to see some
sunspots during the eclipse,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
right before totality, because
there's a sunspot currently

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:90%
on the sun.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Sunspots are
triggered by changes

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
in the sun's magnetic field,
and so they appear as dark spots

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
because the surface
of the sunspot

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
is actually a little bit cooler
than the surrounding surface

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
of the sun, so it appears dark.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Sunspots are one of the
most famous things that we talk

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:10%
about with the sun,
discovered by Galileo.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:10%
What he noticed was that there
were black spots on the sun.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at the time, Galileo
didn't know what they were

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
or why they occurred, but he
did notice that they were there

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and that they moved, indicating
that the sun spun on its axis.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field
gets stretched

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and it stores all
of this energy,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and it can only store so much.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So at first you see the
storing building up.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:84%
That impedes the
heat coming through

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and that makes a
sunspot, this dark patch

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
on the sun that indicates
energy has been building.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And as that energy
builds, eventually that

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
gets released in something a bit
more dramatic and really much

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:90%
more pretty.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Small-scale would be
a prominence, where

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
the material is ejected
from that energy

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:90%
but it comes back to the sun.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a beautiful
horseshoe-shaped filament

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:90%
of gas.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
A little more energy--
that prominence breaks,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and all of that material gets
released into the solar system.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:90%
We call that the solar wind.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It interacts with
our satellites,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
gives us things like the
northern and southern lights.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So sunspots are a really lovely
way of finding and following

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the magnetic cycle of the sun.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a red
rim around the Earth.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what that
was, but it was very cool.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take a moment and
look 360 degrees around you,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
you will notice that
all the way around,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:84%
the horizon looks
like it's a sunset.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's called horizon glow.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This beautiful rose color.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It was as though the sun was
coming up in every direction

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that you could look.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.063 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw that it was a
360-degree twilight as well.

00:15:10.063 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> One minute.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.068 align:middle line:90%
And there comes the shadow.

00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:14.868 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shut off the
motor and watch it happen.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.235 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:23.175 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:24.145 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:15:24.145 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Street lights are
on in the next city.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Shadow just came over me.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.379 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is amazing.

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:53.253 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:90%
That is so cool.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> And it became very eerie.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't anticipate that at all.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What struck me was the eerie
colors that you don't usually

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:90%
see on a normal day.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> And it wasn't like nighttime.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a different--
kind of like a veil had

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
been pulled over my eyes.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was different.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of a ghostly color.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
There was a definite
change in the sound

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:90%
that insects were making.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You distinctly heard the
sounds of the evening come on

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
as totality hit.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:38.743 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Our role here at the Casper
Planetarium has always been

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:10%
to educate the public.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The planetarium dome is a unique
venue to learn about the stars.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:10%
The only place better
to learn about the stars

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:10%
themselves is outside.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:10%
Nothing captures the imagination
like going into that theater,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:10%
watching the lights go
down, and seeing the night

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.588 align:middle line:10%
sky appear before them.

00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd like to thank
everybody for coming.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
How many folks are
visiting from out of town?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:10%
>> There are so many people that
come here that are just amazed

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:10%
at what they're able to learn.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
Even now, during the
eclipse, so many people

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
have said that there was
so much more to an eclipse

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
than they even imagined before.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the more important
eclipses was the eclipse

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
of 1919.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The eclipse of 1919 was
the first opportunity to test

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The mass of the sun
would warp the space,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
causing the star to look like
it's in a different position

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:84%
when viewed close to the
sun during a solar eclipse.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Which affirmed Einstein's
theory of relativity.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> With our digital planetarium,
I can show them in the night

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%
sky as seen from here on Earth.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We can jump off the earth and we
can fly clear out of our galaxy

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.175 align:middle line:84%
and look back where our
Earth is in our galaxy.

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
experience no human

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
being has ever had in real
life, but it's an experience

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:90%
they can have here.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.329 align:middle line:84%
And it gets them imagining what
a wondrous universe we live in.

00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Not everybody
can be an astronaut.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:10%
But any of us can
take a telescope out

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:10%
and look up at the planet
Saturn in the night sky.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, we almost
become a space traveler.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at really far
distant objects in the night

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
sky, we're not only
a space traveler,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
we're also a time traveler,
because we're looking back

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
in time, seeing the light as
it was hundreds or thousands

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of years ago when
it left that object

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and took all that time
to get here to the Earth.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Earth is kind of a big spaceship
traveling through space,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and the moon our
own personal spaceship moving

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:90%
through the solar system.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And our solar system is
moving through our galaxy.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we are
kind of space travelers.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:10%
>> We're just very excited for
people to be able to experience

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:10%
an eclipse.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But one of our things
that we've been working

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
on is educating people not
only of what to look for

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
but how to safely
view the eclipse.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:10%
>> And we very strongly caution
people to not directly look

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:10%
at the sun without some
sort of protection.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And buying solar eclipse
glasses filters out about 99%

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:90%
of the sunlight.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
That will allow you to observe
without any harm to your eye.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You can old-school
like Galileo did it.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Take a piece of cardboard,
poke a small pinhole or a nail

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:10%
hole in it, stand with
your back to the sun,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:10%
and then project a virtual
image of the sun onto a piece

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:10%
of paper or a
piece of cardboard.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The diamond ring effect that
occurs right before the moment

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of totality, when the sunlight
gets hyperfocused into this

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
laser beam, can
blind the observer.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's surprising that people
think that they can look

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
at the sun through multiple
layers of sunglasses,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
or that they can look at the
sun when it's a cloudy day.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The back of our eyes do not
have any pain receptors.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And so people that look
at the sun directly

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
are damaging the back of their
eyes, which is not necessarily

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:90%
noticeable at the time.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But over days, they will notice
that some of their vision

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:90%
is lost.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you could go
completely blind.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our favorite ways
when we're working with a group

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of people is to have
the sun spotter out.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And that allows the sun to be
projected onto a piece of paper

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
in about a three-inch
diameter circle.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's a safe way to watch
the progress of the eclipse

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and do it with a whole group
of people being able to watch.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The people of Wyoming are
the nicest people I've ever met.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an opportunity for
friendship and fellowship.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:10%
>> It was as though everyone
around us was your best friend.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> We're excited.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It was like Christmas Eve last
night, when you were a kid.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There was such a sense
of camaraderie and everyone

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
working together and
supporting each other.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something we do
together as human beings.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It had this rock
concert aspect to it.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:10%
There was a group component to
it where everyone was, I think,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:10%
on some level connected
to everyone else.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I loved the sound of people
cheering and gasping around me.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.686 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:32.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, my God,
it's unbelievable.

00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:33.574 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, look at the sun.

00:21:33.574 --> 00:21:35.032 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And to do it
surrounded by my friends--

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that made it even better.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I went all the way to
Wyoming to see this eclipse.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The great American eclipse.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
As this was called.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Was followed by the great
American traffic jam.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The drive from Casper to Denver
normally would take four hours.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It took us 10.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The worst traffic
jam in Wyoming history.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.223 align:middle line:90%
And it was all worth it.

00:22:03.223 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Not a doubt that I
wouldn't do it again.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a mystical
thing that had happened.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And it made me wonder what
it was like thousands, if not

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:84%
millions of years ago when early
humans saw the first eclipse

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and wondered what was going on.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout time, various
cultures have recorded what

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
they thought was causing
a total solar eclipse.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the myths about
eclipses from ancient cultures

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
involved something
eating the sun.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
To the Chinese, it was
a dragon eating the sun.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
To the Hindus of
India, it was a demon

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:90%
that had swallowed the sun.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans in Central America
saw a serpent eating the sun.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The Vikings thought it was
a wolf that was eating the sun.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous
people of the north

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
tell stories of a
bear eating the sun.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that an eclipse
is nothing more than the moon

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
passing in front of the
sun and casting a shadow.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Cultures thousands of
years ago were afraid.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid of this event.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> If I was some indigenous
person living in the land

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly this
started to happen,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
totally freaked out.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead, because I
knew it was happening,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I was in reverence of it all.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If you understand
how things work,

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
then you're no longer
afraid of them.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been some great
examples when one particular

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
culture or person's
understanding of science

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
or nature around them has given
them an advantage over others.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
As an ancient example
with the Mayans,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
the Mayan priests were
early astronomers.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they studied the night
sky, the constellations,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of the
moon and the sun,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were very well
and very accurately

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
able to predict when solar
eclipses would occur.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:10%
They were able to build
this into their culture

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:10%
as a way to represent the
success of particular rituals

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:10%
or beckonings to their gods,
in particular, Quetzalcoatl,

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:10%
who was their main god.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so what the priests would
do, unbeknownst to everybody

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
else, is pick a
totally eclipse day

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
as one of these
days for the ritual,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
knowing that if they
set it up right,

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
they could build to the moment
of eclipse and use the eclipse

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:90%
itself as a sign from the gods.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they would usually
say, if the gods have heard us,

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
they will bring back the sun.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
If the gods will
cure our disease,

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.832 align:middle line:90%
they will bring back the sun.

00:25:50.832 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile the priests
knew the whole time

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.998 align:middle line:84%
that the sun was
going to disappear

00:25:53.998 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was going to
reappear two minutes later.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They might not have fully
understood the science

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
behind why these
things occurred,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
but they surely knew
that they occurred,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
they knew that they
were going to occur,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and they timed a lot
of the cultural rituals

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:90%
around these moments.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed
the priests to use

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that moment and that
knowledge to give them

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
an advantage over
everybody else.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> All too often science
is discounted by the public

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:90%
at large.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Our very civilization stands
on the shoulders of science.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.813 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we could feed
nearly eight billion people.

00:26:29.813 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we can
have communications

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we don't die
at 20 and 30 years old.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And a whole host of other
benefits come from science.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Science is at the heart
of our civilization.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And for once, all of America
got to see science was good.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So much of what we take
for granted in modern life is

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
a result of basic science
and applied science

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and engineering.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And to turn a blind eye to
that is a recipe for disaster,

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Science literacy is very
important for a society.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we can be
scientifically literate,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
we can make better decisions
for not only our ourselves,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
but also for the
world we live in.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So we need to not only impart
skills to the next generation

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that will help them understand
the science as we know it

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
today, but that will also
give them the tools to develop

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and understand the
science of the future.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Technology changes
so quickly that we

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:10%
need to be able to
keep up with that

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully be the leaders
of that changing technology.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.105 align:middle line:84%
>> If we can get away
from fossil fuel,

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
if we can reduce the amount
of carbon dioxide we put

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:84%
into our atmosphere, then we can
turn around the trend of global

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
warming and man-made
climate change.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> At some point, we have
to realize that we are all

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
co-Earthlings and that climate
change is an Earthling issue.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to require
Earthling solutions,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
particularly when
we are treading

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%
into truly unknown territory.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:84%
As climate change
gets more rampant,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see crises
that we've never seen before.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Science education
is so important.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Our next generation needs
to know how things work

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and how to take
care of our planet

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and how to make good
decisions based on science.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And that way they
won't be led astray

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:90%
by a lot of misconceptions.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Being scientifically literate
means you're not going to fall

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:10%
for just anything anybody says.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very important as
a scientist that I draw all

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.425 align:middle line:84%
of my conclusions from something
that I directly observe

00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:53.225 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a critical difference
between philosophy and physics.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Philosophy allows for a
personal opinion or bias

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:90%
to be part of your answer.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:10%
And that is something that
science simply cannot allow.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Bias and personal
opinion can push you

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong
direction, or worse,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
force you to force your data
to support the theory you want

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of allowing the data
to guide you towards the more

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:90%
correct theory.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Science is all
about a process.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:10%
It starts when you
observe a phenomenon

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:10%
that you don't understand.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And observing something
you don't understand always

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:90%
leads you to ask questions.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.180 align:middle line:84%
When we learn about stars,
we start wondering, well,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
do those stars
have other planets?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.363 align:middle line:84%
And then we start looking
for those planets.

00:29:47.363 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
discover those planets,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
we ask, well, do any of
those planets have water?

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, if they have
water, do they have life?

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And then that ultimately
leads to further questions

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and further observations
and further questions

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:90%
and further testing.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So science is all
about a process that

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:84%
starts with observing
and asking questions

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and then goes on to
trying things out.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Asking a question, looking
around you to support whether

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:10%
that question is valid or
invalid, gathering data,

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.040 align:middle line:10%
analyzing that data.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.160 align:middle line:10%
We therefore hand
off all of that work

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:10%
to a peer, someone
in our field who

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:10%
knows as much or more than
we do, who can read it

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and double-check that
the analysis of our data

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:10%
was valid and
therefore validates

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.580 align:middle line:10%
whether our conclusions
are appropriate or not.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The major differentiating
factor is peer review.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't just believe me.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the snake oil
salesman where you should just

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
take my word for it.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And that scientific
method, that peer review,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
is what holds our
feet to the fire.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because it gives
us a truer grasp of reality,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.618 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
important nowadays.

00:31:04.618 --> 00:31:06.910 align:middle line:10%
>> When I work with students,
one of the most important

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.925 align:middle line:10%
things that I feel is that
they make observations.

00:31:10.925 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to be aware
of what's going on

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
around you, because if
you observe, then maybe

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:90%
you will wonder.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And then if you have wonder,
you'll ask questions,

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and those will lead you
to research and to really

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:90%
do good science.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if anything were
to inspire a person about

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
the scientific realm, I
think this would do it.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing why it works
and how it works enhances

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that
for years they've

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.300 align:middle line:84%
said totality would begin
at 1:28 and certain seconds

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:90%
in Nashville.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, at 1:28,
the moon blocked the sun.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It was like clockwork.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to marvel at
something like that,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's science that does that.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Eclipses these days are
predicted using sophisticated

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.896 align:middle line:10%
computer programs that work
out all the geometry between

00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:03.040 align:middle line:10%
the positions of
the sun, the moon,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:10%
and the Earth with
respect to each other.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:10%
It's a lot of
geometry, trigonometry

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:10%
to do the calculations.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:10%
But it can be done in a split
second now with computers.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The neat thing about
science is it doesn't destroy

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of the universe.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
If anything it helps you
appreciate that mystery more.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I think our understanding
of the science,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
our understanding
of how it works--

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I think it enhances it.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> By looking at a distant
nebula that's forming a star,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
because I know what it's made
of doesn't diminish its wonder

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and its beauty
for me in any way.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it enhances it.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It is so important that you
have the opportunity to witness

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
it yourself, because
as you observe this,

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:90%
then you begin to wonder.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you wonder, then
maybe you have questions.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And questions can lead
you to investigations.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
science is all about.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Observing a total solar
eclipse for yourself is really

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:90%
about personal discovery.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
It's about experiencing
something for yourself.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.225 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so much that we
don't know even about our sun.

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons why it's so important
