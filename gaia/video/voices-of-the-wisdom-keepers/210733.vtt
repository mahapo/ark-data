superficially,
not pretentiously,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
but deeply that
there is a problem,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and the problem really has to do
with a split of community that

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
translates into this
rugged individualism, which

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
is adjacent pathology of
isolation, longing to belong

to fulfill that.

Once the recognition of the
problem has been verified,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the other step will consist in
raising the issue as to what

separation, of isolation,

that the Earth is a
generous nurturer, who

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:10%
Because in their
memory, they lived

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:10%
in that way for
thousands of years

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:10%
before this modern day came.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And so we need to tap into that.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And that memory is
going to wake them up.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start
working and really talking

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:90%
about sustainable living.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of looking at life.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
God created us with
the ability to choose.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We have to take that
responsibility more seriously.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to do what the Mohawk
Nation, Senecas over what

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
is now New York.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
What they have
said is when we're

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
any deliberation,

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
we must take the
seventh generation

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.872 align:middle line:84%
that's coming toward
us into consideration

00:12:44.872 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:90%
before we make that decision.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a way to look
at these decisions

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're making
right now today

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.365 align:middle line:84%
that are affecting the great,
great, great grandchildren that

00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:00.165 align:middle line:90%
are yet to come.

00:13:00.165 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:90%
We're such a throwaway society.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to understand
that what we do to the Earth,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:90%
we do to ourselves.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
What we do to ourselves,
we do to the Earth,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
separation there.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
We're really linked together.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:90%
We have to realize that.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And we have to weigh it out.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The only way that we can
truly make these changes that

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
are necessary is when we
realize that all of creation

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:84%
is connected together
and that it's here.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It can help us.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Or it can expedite our
demise, one of the two.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.515 align:middle line:84%
And right now we're not
making the wise choices.

00:13:50.515 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:90%
We're down this steep slope.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And we need to turn that
thought process around.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to remind ourselves that
we're related to all of this.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
It is here.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And it is crying out.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
It's crying for us
to change our ways.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to
feel that in our hearts

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and hear those
cries and to realize

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
that every decision
that we make is either

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be of benefit
to the Mother Earth

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to be
to the demise of us

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
as human population
on this Earth.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:90%
The Earth will stay here.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.763 align:middle line:90%
Our mother will stay here.

00:14:31.763 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
We will, if we continue
to make bad choices,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
won't be here much longer.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And we have to realize that.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're
at the threshold

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful awakening
and that the awakening

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to turn our hearts
and minds around to realize

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:90%
that God has given us so much.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time for us to live
up to our end of the agreement

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to say that we are the ones that
are responsible to make sure

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that the water is pure, to
make sure that the air is pure,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that Mother Earth
is not wounded anymore, to make

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
sure that the fires
are sacred once again,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and that they produce light
and that they produce warmth.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And they produce love.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:90%
And they produce wisdom.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
That's where we need to
go with this conversation.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The matrix that we are in
now is this old consciousness,

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.864 align:middle line:84%
this current level
of consciousness.

00:15:56.864 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And it really is a
matrix in the sense

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
we see is not real.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an illusion.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:10%
And everything is based on lies.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We'd say, well, you're
saying a lot of absolutes.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's absolutely true.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:10%
The matrix makes us believe
we're living in a world that

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:10%
is made by the human beings.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's made from a
disconnected consciousness.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
that it creates

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:90%
is equally disconnected.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
If we want a world in which
everything is connected,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
then we've got to
connect ourselves first.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.045 align:middle line:90%
Then we can escape this matrix.

00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a rubber
glove and blow it up.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
[BLOWING NOISE] And
these fingers stick up.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:84%
In this analogy, these
fingers think they're human.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.320 align:middle line:90%
But they're only one breath.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:90%
That's who we really are.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
That is the matrix,
this fact that we

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:90%
think we're human beings.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, we're spirit
in human experience.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> These days not many
people are brought up with

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
consciousness about how me
drinking this glass of water is

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
going to impact you or
her or other people.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
that we're being told

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:90%
is, I need this glass of water.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I'm
going to drink it.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what happened
to the rest of the people.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And so people have gotten to a
place where they don't really

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:90%
want change.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to change when
you don't have to change?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Staying awake
means that you have

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to work on your consciousness
on a constant basis.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is really why
we are struggling as a world

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:03.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're too short memory
when it comes to working

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:90%
on our consciousness.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
People are very
easy to go to sleep.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
we have accustomed

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
people to entertainment,
constantly entertaining them

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
away from those things
that are very important.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness changes
the moment we begin to pay

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
attention to the fundamental
elements that have contributed

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to sustaining and maintaining
our lives here on this planet.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Recognition of this is
indeed a radical act

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
upgrade that will

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
begin to itemize all the
problems that we have worked

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:84%
hard at creating
and, by doing so,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
intensify our concern with
respect to our redemption.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Leading to the question, what
do we do to redeem ourselves?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
We've gone so far.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Are we still redeemable.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
When we get concerned
down to this depth,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
we begin to realize that
all life in this planet

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
deserve the same
respect and that

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:84%
were no better than
the other lives

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:90%
that Mother Earth is tending to.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The animal, the
plants, all of that

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
are being given vitality
by Mother Earth.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And we are no different.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:84%
By the time we get to
this level of recognition,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say we are so
conscious that we might

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
say that we have reawakened our
Indigenous self, because it is

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
a loss of that
Indigenous part of us

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that has led to this sort
of all out catastrophe.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:10%
And it has meant
countless lives being

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:10%
taken, countless destruction
being brought to the Earth,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:10%
to the point where the very way
that we live is unsustainable.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:90%
It cannot last.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we have agreed
that we are going to head out

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to an all out
apocalypse, as if we know

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:90%
that the Titanic is sinking.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we are working hard to make
it sink anyway, not to change.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so by recognizing this,
our consciousness will kick in

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and will make us first
take responsibility.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is going
to lead to the changes that

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
are needed like yesterday.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go back to the
differentiation between making

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
a living and living a purpose,
if you don't want people to be

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.687 align:middle line:84%
worried about what
they're doing,

00:22:54.687 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to initiate them.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
initiate them, you

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
know you're going to
ignite something then

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:90%
that will awaken that gift.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So by not initiating,
you leave a door

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that is wide as possible for you
to have room for manipulation

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But now, life being
life, whether you get

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
initiated by a group of
elders, by a village,

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
by a tribe, life itself
will initiate you.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is maybe
that when you get self-initiated

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
or when life chooses
to initiate you,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a village
to welcome you back to say,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.585 align:middle line:90%
right on.

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Now you got it, you got it.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.368 align:middle line:90%
So now deliver.

00:24:01.368 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And so we do get initiated.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the validation
and the cheering of a community

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to say, you did it.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why a lot of us
get into loops of initiation

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
because our psyche is trying to
grasp with what just happened

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:90%
and how we feel.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And because there is silence
around what is happening,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
we basically go in,
maybe it's not it.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we didn't get initiated.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So let me create another
circumstance that you're

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:90%
going to get initiated.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of young people
are getting initiated.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And even some adults who said
they've never been initiated,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:90%
something happened.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So the modern day initiation
is not necessarily

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
going to look like an
Indigenous initiation.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:10%
But divorce will be
a big initiation.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Losing a parent is an
initiation and so on and so on.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So it looks different.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But those things will
definitely get you

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
to a place of initiation.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, for instance, war
as an initiation and a lot

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of veterans coming back
without any kind of welcoming

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes without any
kind of acknowledgment.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the key is
acknowledgment and welcoming.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:10%
So when a veteran has
returned and has not had that,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:10%
it's very hard for them to
reintegrate society and be

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:10%
a, quote unquote,
"normal functioning

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:10%
person" within society.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
is a lot of welcoming

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:07.060 align:middle line:84%
because when you don't have
that initial welcoming,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:84%
your system goes
into shutdown mode

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to feel
the pain of not being welcome.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result,
one welcoming

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is not going to do it anymore.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
You need several
welcoming until that door

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
has made soft enough
that it can open again

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to let those people in
to actually welcome you.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so by us being
able to welcome them,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:84%
we're not only validating
their experience.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But we're also saying,
hey, we notice.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
We have bear witness to this.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You didn't go through
this for nothing.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason
why you went for it.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:90%
We went through it.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The origin of this mentality
of the loss of connection

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it really has
to do with, let's just say,

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
a small group of power hungry
that have made a deal with--

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
let's just call it the devil--

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and whose soul purpose is
to go out there, seek out,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and destroy anything
that is not serving

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the greed that have been
inoculated into them,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:90%
his irrelevance.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And whether this is something
that secret societies are

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
contributing to sustaining,
knowing that in the end

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to mean destruction
of a massive proportion.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
What is predominant is
that the source of this

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
human losing respect,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
losing respect for
the Earth simply

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because the immediacy of
exploitation and the benefit

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
reaped from that
as men that they

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
can get instant gratification
even if it means down the road

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
that destruction happened.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
A person who ends up
thinking like this

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:84%
has no respect for
himself or herself,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
has no respect for the
Earth, and has no respect

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
for continuity, the kind
that means that we live now

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that would
pave the way for others

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
down the road to find a
safe, sane place to grow.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
This is why this energy has
taken the time to expand

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and to grow to the point where
it has become so gigantic that

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it
cannot be stopped.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we have here all kinds
of greedy expression associated

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.890 align:middle line:84%
with materialism that is so
rooted on a desire to expand

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that in the end it's
self-diagnosed as insatiable

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:90%
when you cannot be satiated.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It means that you
have a deep problem.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And that problem is
likely to become epidemic

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and to infect others.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
At this juncture, I'm sure
that there is knowledge

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of the depth of the problem.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just that sometimes
the problem we create

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
can be so big that
we become completely

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:90%
unable to do anything about it.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So we go forward knowing
that we're going to die.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
very good picture.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you've got to stop
and be willing to do so,

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this is a
dignifying position to take.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So in order for
community to be restored,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:90%
there is nothing to reinvent.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a
discontinuation of a lot

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of things that need to happen.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We got to stop doing
certain things.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got to stop
exploiting the Earth,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
polluting her,
disrespecting her.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that, we're going
to recognize that, indeed, when

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.320 align:middle line:84%
we disrespect the Earth,
we disrespect the mother,

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:90%
we disrespect the feminine.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, we
disrespect ourselves.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:84%
This becomes, therefore, a
shameful act of such depth

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that the desacralization
of the Earth

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
take away from us
the core spirit that

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
is meant to give us an
experience of this presence

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and this dimension as
something elegant, dignifying,

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:90%
and joyful.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
why at this juncture

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the Indigenous wisdom
is more than ever needed

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:84%
because it has taken this wisdom
to sustain continuity long

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.065 align:middle line:90%
enough for modernity to occur.

00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, the Earth in her
infinite love and bounty

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
has the capacity to
forgive and to give us

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:84%
the kind of shelter that
is deserving of people

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:90%
who know how to show respect.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore,
it's just a matter

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing that we have
defaulted in a lot of things

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and to come down on our knees,
showing more humility than ever

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to be granted
this type of forgiveness.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It is consciousness
and a radical act

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of strength to rise from the
ashes of self-destruction

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and destruction of
this Earth in order

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the kind
of dispensation that

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is respectful of all
lives and is respectful,

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:90%
more importantly, of the Earth.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it seems
difficult. But, really,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
it's one small step at a time.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
First, we work on
our belief system.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And we let go of those things
that we think that we know.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And we allow ourselves
to pray, to meditate,

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and to walk in the midst
of the present moment.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
When the ancestors see that you
are searching for that truth

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:84%
inside, they will
send you messages.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
They will let you know that
you're on the right track,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be small
steps along the way

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.469 align:middle line:84%
being able to go
up to the mountains

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and spend their
weekend in silence

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and walking through
the forest, being

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
able to listen to
the birds, and being

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
able to listen to
the wind, as it

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
moves through the ancient
forests, the old growth

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:90%
forests.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Being able to take
the time to set down

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
those things that have
been a distraction to us,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:90%
just set them down.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Then say I want to just
focus on one thing.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is how do I
gain that inner peace?

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:84%
How do I gain that insight
into who I really am.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And how to relate to this world
that is in front of me, that

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:90%
is before me?

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a way for us
to take these steps.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if we're
in the inner cities,

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and we hear the
sirens blowing, and we

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
hear all these
different noises, they

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
can break up those moments
of peace that we have.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.100 align:middle line:84%
There's ways to go deeper
into this world of prayer

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and meditation that will block
out all of the realities that

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
were faced, even in the inner
city that takes discipline.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a belief
that we have the ability

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond the
existing reality.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Small steps along the way,
light a candle, offer a prayer,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:90%
sit in silence.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Be at peace.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to come to
terms with yourself,

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
all those things that
are distractions to us,

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it's paying
the light bill,

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's the cost
of gas, or whether it's

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:84%
something at work, or whether
it's a relationship, set it

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
all down.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And say, I'm here for
this moment in time

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to come to a deeper
understanding of who am I

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and how do I relate
to this reality here.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Small steps, it'll take time.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's about belief
systems about who you are

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and where you want
to be in the future.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Those things that are
coming toward you.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.495 align:middle line:90%
You can look into that.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
What the others told me, when
I started having these dreams,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is that you could
interact with your dreams.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if
something's not going right,

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:84%
then, you can interact with
it and change that reality

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:90%
with your own mind.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the power
of belief right there.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:84%
That's where we can go with
our life, with our time,

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.327 align:middle line:84%
as long as we don't get bogged
down in this modern society,

00:37:00.327 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:84%
as long as we don't get
bogged down in that,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and think that that's the
best it's ever going to be.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.630 align:middle line:90%
It's right here, right now.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
That's really sad
to think about.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
This work that's
coming toward us

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
it's going to show us so much
of what we need to know, so much

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:90%
of how to conduct ourselves.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.865 align:middle line:84%
So much of how to be in
relation to God's creation.

00:37:23.865 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though there seems to
be quite a bit of work ahead

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
of us, but my sense is what
the elders have passed on

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
through the times
was that love is

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be the antidote
to all of these things

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that we find ourselves
in the midst of.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.220 align:middle line:84%
As long as we can carry
the capacity of love,

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and we walk within the integrity
of what God intended to us,

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:90%
others will see that.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And they all want to
share in that experience.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It began, obviously, in
Europe when the world had

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.430 align:middle line:84%
slipped into
masculine imbalance.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:84%
That was something like
4,000 to 6,000 years ago.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The pendulum had swung to
masculine imbalance, which

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.180 align:middle line:90%
is a time we're still in now.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.340 align:middle line:84%
The elders say,
for the first time,

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.890 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of
time, we have an opportunity

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
to stop this pendulum
swinging back and forth

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:84%
between masculine, and
feminine, and balance.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And stop it in the center.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, we have
to restore the feminine back

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:90%
to its original place.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.970 align:middle line:90%
One is that its sacred.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Feminine is sacred.

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Two, that it is about love,
and nurturing, and caring for,

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and receiving all
these aspects that are

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.050 align:middle line:90%
the qualities of the feminine.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
These are aspects that
are not honored today.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:90%
We need to bring them back.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we
need to bring back

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is restoring the feminine back
to its place of sacred honor.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And then women will be
restored to their place

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:47.855 align:middle line:84%
as original healers during
this process, during this time.

00:39:47.855 --> 00:39:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, women would
now engage in ceremonies.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason that originally
women were considered sacred

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and are sacred is that,
within their body,

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
is a thing they
call the womb, which

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:90%
is really a field of energy.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a physical function.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a field of energy that
is identical to the field

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of energy at the
center of the universe.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's from that place, at
the center of the universe,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:90%
that we get creativity.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And we get creation.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And with that is contained
in the woman's body.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, through ceremony,
women can take that energy

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and put it out into a
physical realm in this world.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And from that point, it becomes
a container, a container

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to produce something
totally new.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Until that's done, nothing
new is going to be created.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be impossible
without the women to do that.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.250 align:middle line:84%

being produced without that,

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.680 align:middle line:84%
anything, I don't
care what it is,

new agricultural systems, none

They will add to the
problems eventually,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:84%
over time because that's created
from the same consciousness

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that created the problems,
in the first place.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:84%
To change that
consciousness, then, we

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.160 align:middle line:84%
have to go to that
field to produce

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
anything that is
going to be genuinely

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:90%

focusing on?

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Are we focusing on that which
we're trying to move away from,

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
or that which we're
trying to move towards?

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.430 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to move.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And they can come right
back to this present moment.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So if it can happen
in this present moment

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to go both directions,
how is it that we

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:84%
can refer to it as the
past or the future,

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.010 align:middle line:90%
if it's right here right now?

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes the ability
for our mind to grasp that,

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.100 align:middle line:90%
to hold on to that.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are so powerful, I
would say, so much under use

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that we can change
our reality once we

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.360 align:middle line:84%
see that there are very few
limitations to our work that's

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.400 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
As long as we use
the understanding

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that the thing
that is guiding us

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:84%
is the songs, and the dances,
and the ceremonies of our life,

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.720 align:middle line:84%
the walk on this
Earth, that we're

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
gifted to us from the creator
from the beginning of time.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
To me, when we're able to move
into that realm of spirit,

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.460 align:middle line:90%
nothing else exists.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.235 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else needs to
exist, including time.

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:46.346 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:50.765 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:50.765 --> 00:46:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
we've done is disconnect from

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.940 align:middle line:84%
our heart because of past
traumas of some kind.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's a
soul on Earth that isn't--

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.915 align:middle line:84%
have a legacy of trauma
in their lineage.

00:46:15.915 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.860 align:middle line:84%
When vets came
back from Vietnam,

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.880 align:middle line:84%
they came back by the thousands,
many of whom were depressed

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and took to addictive drugs,
and all these kinds of things.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors couldn't
figure out what was wrong,

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:84%
but they knew there
was something going on.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they put a name to it,
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:90%
PTSD.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We think about all
the wars that there

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:84%
has been in human
history, thousands

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.546 align:middle line:90%
of different kinds of wars.

00:46:52.546 --> 00:46:56.510 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, they had the
Crusades and the Inquisition,

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:00.470 align:middle line:84%
where they killed
millions of women.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
In the US, we've had
World War I, World War II,

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Korean conflict, Vietnam
War, the Civil War.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The Civil War killed
700,000 Americans,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Mexican-American war.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.320 align:middle line:84%
You just go through
these, and you

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:84%
know that the survivors
of these human tragedies

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
had to have been people
who wanted to separate

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.830 align:middle line:90%
from their feelings.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what they
figured out with PTSD

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:90%
with the Vietnam vets.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to remember
or be reminded of the horrors

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that they experienced
during that war.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it would take
to these behaviors.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things
that happened, according

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to our elders, when you
separate from your heart,

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is that you take to addictive
behaviors, something

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that is a poor attempt to try
to replace the heart itself.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:84%
They also said addictive
behaviors like a big stomach

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.290 align:middle line:84%
wants to eat all the time,
but can never be filled.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:90%
That's where we found ourselves.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And those people became
parents, and they pass along

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:84%
the behaviors of addiction
to their children.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Now we live in a society
that's based on addiction.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.685 align:middle line:90%
It's really horrific.

00:48:20.685 --> 00:48:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what we first
must do is come

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to terms with our own
pains, our own shadows.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And actually, move
through them emotionally.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Get back in touch with
the way it makes us feel,

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.520 align:middle line:84%
while you understand that you're
not attaching yourself to it.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You're just simply
experiencing the feeling

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that occurred whenever something
happened to you as a child,

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.140 align:middle line:90%
As children, were totally open.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to get
traumatized, in some way.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be a spanking.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It could be something worse.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take much.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to go
to that place, where

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:84%
we suffered the trauma, and
work through those traumas,

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and let them go.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Just totally let them go.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you have to
let go of judgment of yourself.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would have
compassion for a child,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:84%
you would have a
compassion for yourself.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:90%
And say, I did go through that.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And it was tough.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I did the best I could,
that kind of thing.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
way of doing it.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Another way would be
going to ceremony,

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.430 align:middle line:84%
healing ceremonies, where
the culture themselves

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:84%
have ways to heal those
things that keep us

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:58.320 align:middle line:84%
from being a real human being,
keeping us from being present.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Grieving ceremonies
would be one of them.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
and probably all people

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:90%
have forgotten how to grieve.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So they don't grieve.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't grieve,
it's like a stagnant pool

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:16.170 align:middle line:84%
that's inside of you that
just stagnates, and rots,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and eventually would kill you.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not healthy to hold
on to any of those things.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Guilt, shame,
remorse, anger, rage,

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.940 align:middle line:90%
all that comes from the past.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Fear, which is projection
to the future, something

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't happened yet,
you let go of these things,

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.670 align:middle line:84%
until you get to the
point where you can just

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:90%
be present in the moment.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.212 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:47.212 --> 00:51:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We take a look at this
reality that we find herself

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.640 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
this current day.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.640 align:middle line:90%
It's about perspective.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The perspective is those
things that are out there,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the tangible things
that are out there.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:84%
If we turn that
around and go inside,

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.240 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes an
internal question.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the internal
question is, where

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.950 align:middle line:90%
is my place in this world?

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Where is my place in this
beautiful part of the world.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And how do I deepen
my understanding,

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.150 align:middle line:84%
not of the physical
nature of things,

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:84%
but of the spiritual nature of
things, that are all around me?

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in a hotel
with a dear friend,

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and she used the
table, as an example.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, tell me
what you see there?

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at it.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was
going to answer it wrong.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:51.950 align:middle line:90%
So I just dove in.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's a coffee table.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And she says, before, it
wasn't a coffee table.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.080 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It was a Walnut tree.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So before it was a
Walnut tree, was it?

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.120 align:middle line:84%
She said it was a
spiritual element,

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.383 align:middle line:84%
since that's where you need
to begin the conversation.

00:52:09.383 --> 00:52:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That it's really
about the spirit.

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.650 align:middle line:84%
What the elders tell us is
that the spirit goes before us

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
wherever we are, if we're living
in relationship to the spirit

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.035 align:middle line:90%
that exists within.

00:52:23.035 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Like when I leave here,
I'll offer a prayer.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And ask my spirit to go
before me to clear the way,

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.750 align:middle line:84%
so that I can make
it home safely.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.670 align:middle line:84%
In that relationship, we have
to bring that back to light,

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to use
that and understand

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that as the essential
truth to us, rather

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.470 align:middle line:90%
than it being an afterthought.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Or rather than being left
out of the conversation,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.850 align:middle line:84%
it should be the
focus in the catalyst

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.650 align:middle line:90%
of our future conversations.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There were some
elders that I was with,

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and we just had some time
together having a dinner.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have just a
little bit of time left.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
ask you what would

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:84%
be the most valuable
thing for us

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to do, as far as our energy
and our work for the short time

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:23.380 align:middle line:84%
remaining, both the elders
said work with the youth.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Work with the young.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
going to change this reality.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:33.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to give them the tools,
and the knowledge, the wisdom

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that comes from our relationship
to this culture, to the spirit,

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and to the language
of our people,

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to live
to breathe once again.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I asked an elder what was
the most devastating impact

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that our foreigner, our
friends, our relatives who

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
came across the Atlantic,
what was it they

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.800 align:middle line:90%
brought here to our land?

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And what is the most
devastating feature of that?

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.540 align:middle line:84%
He said that they brought
it out into our lives.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They brought out that
we had less confidence

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that we were healers,
that we were teachers,

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that we were visionaries, that
we were the people who could

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.430 align:middle line:84%
work with the medicine plants
they brought down into our life

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that we had a direct line or
connection with creator of all.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so he suggested to me,
after making that statement.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And he says, your purpose
on this Earth right

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:37.040 align:middle line:84%
now is to extract that
doubt from the conscience

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of our people, to let
them know that they

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.730 align:middle line:84%
are the healers, that they are
the teachers, that they are

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:49.230 align:middle line:84%
the visionaries that can
see into the future, what

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.690 align:middle line:90%
people refer to as the future.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Because absent of that doubt,
we have all the capacity

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:57.390 align:middle line:90%
that God had intended for us.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And that applies to all
sectors of our society,

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:84%
all sectors of our human
population here on Earth.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's really to
eradicate that doubt,

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and to put it in its place
the truth about who we are,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose of us
being on this Earth today.

>> Any person in
this day and age,

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:43.130 align:middle line:84%
who is entertaining
this kind of thought,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:84%
the thought associated with new
consciousness needing to come

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:54.790 align:middle line:84%
out, the thought associated
with community, with village,

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that person is actually
a child of the Earth,

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:02.620 align:middle line:84%
who was being hired by Mother
Earth to do the impossible

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.940 align:middle line:90%
task.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:10.390 align:middle line:84%
That person is engaged in not
just raising consciousness,

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:84%
but in doing some massive
janitorial work of cleaning

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness from
all this garbage that

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.520 align:middle line:90%
has wrapped itself around it.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So that it can go
all the way down

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to that shiny piece
of indigenous core,

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that would then take
on the job of restoring

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.340 align:middle line:90%
the respect due to the Earth.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so such a person must
see himself or herself,

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:49.170 align:middle line:84%
as, therefore, a
sacred entity, who

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is engaged in a priestly
activity for the redemption

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.985 align:middle line:90%
of humanity before this Earth.

00:56:59.985 --> 00:57:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:03.827 align:middle line:90%

that we, too, can come home.

We thank you for the owl

can see in the dark.
