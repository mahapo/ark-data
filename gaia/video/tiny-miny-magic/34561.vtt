<v Voiceover>People think magic is everywhere,</v>

2
00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:06.266
but everywhere has to start somewhere.

(hopeful music)

4
00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.282
Every day, millions of letters get sorted out

5
00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.733
and sent off to the zip codes of their destiny.

6
00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:19.984
Mail's here.

7
00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:26.313
And when the letters reach their zip code,

8
00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:29.660
one person's responsible for bringing them to our homes.

9
00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:39.418
We don't know his name, we don't know his age.

10
00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:42.822
Most of us don't even know what he looks like.

11
00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:49.957
But we always take for granted

12
00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:54.465
that every single day at 3pm, the mail comes.

13
00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.977
(upbeat music)

14
00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:11.439

15
00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.172

18
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.741
Mail's here.

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.164

32
00:06:17.572 --> 00:06:19.090
<v ->Hey, did you get the mail?</v>

33
00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.753
<v ->You got this.</v>

34
00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:24.511
It's from the mailman.

35
00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:28.405
<v ->Oh, that's so cute.</v>

36
00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:30.210
He's really hot, isn't he?

37
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.787
<v ->You should write him back.</v>

38
00:06:32.787 --> 00:06:34.271
<v ->And say what?</v>

39
00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:38.286
<v ->Tell him that you'd like to go out with him,</v>

40
00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:40.089
maybe go see the new Woody Allen movie.

41
00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.620
I hear it's really good.

42
00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:46.543
<v ->Okay, okay, thanks.</v>

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.758
