According to the Scole Group,
their spirit communicators

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
requested that they
place this empty glass

It created energy
stored in the dome,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%

to produce the phenomena that

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:90%
happened at Scole.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But since these
phenomena are so unusual,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
the group knew that without
careful independent scrutiny,

their experiments would
be dismissed as fake.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the group

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and most of the world is
full of mystery, for me

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%

possibility of fraud,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
these scientists were
allowed to inspect the cellar

and all its contents
before and after sessions.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
All participants had
to empty their pockets

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and leave their
belongings outside.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The cellar had only one
entrance and this door

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
was kept locked
during all sessions.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Despite these precautions,
the incredible events at Scole

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:90%
continued unabated.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And the SPR
investigators reported

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:90%
what they saw in graphic terms.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>We saw colored lights.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:90%
We saw materializations.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We had direct voices-- that
is, spirit voices talking

from the air.

So whole range of
phenomena which

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
could not be mistaken
by three investigators

>>In the spirit of
openness, the Scole Group

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:10%
allowed more investigators
to scrutinize their sessions.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:10%
These included
leading scientists

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:10%
from several disciplines,
even a professional magician.

One of the scientists was
the internationally renowned

Dr. Rupert Sheldrake.

Most materialists assume that
both of them are impossible.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a kind
of dogmatic denial

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
by some scientists of the
possibility of these things.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say that was
a scientific understanding.

The only way to have a
scientific understanding

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:90%
is to do the research.

test their expertise

against the expertise
on the other side.

For example, Professor Archie
Roy, who's an astronomer

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and specializes in the
movement of celestial bodies,

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
had a discussion with the other
side about celestial mechanics.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said afterwards that
he thought there were only

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
about half a dozen people in the
country who would know exactly

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:90%

00:23:25.264 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Although the scientists
found this sort of evidence

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
impressive, they still
needed to eliminate

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
any possibility of
fraud taking place

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:90%
under the cover of darkness.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the Scole Group
devised several controls

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to help eliminate
this possibility.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
One of these controls
involved all participants

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:90%
wearing luminous wristbands.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
These bands were
attached with Velcro,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.041 align:middle line:84%
so they could not be removed
without attracting attention.

00:23:51.041 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
They'd also requested the use
of night vision equipment.

And they said, not yet.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It would interfere with
the energy in some way.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So we had to accept this
with great reluctance.

But if it were, it would
take an awfully long time

00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was to
pass through bodies.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:10%
>>I was actually used as a
Guinea pig in the early days

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:10%
to see how it felt and
to develop the phenomena.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And this light would actually
enter through my chest,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and then three minutes
later, it would probably

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
pop out of the arm or something,
and disappear across a room.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.774 align:middle line:84%
This was being developed to
produce a heating phenomena.

00:26:14.774 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:10%
>>I have this bad
knee, and at one point

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:10%
we had a light that was
moving around the room

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:10%
and rested on my
knee for a, minute

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.539 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly moved
inside my knee.

00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, she just went
into my bad knee.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:10%
[CHATTERING]

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:10%
I could feel it moving
around in my knee,

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:10%
and then all of a sudden
shot out the back of my leg

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:10%
and took off.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:10%
The pain was greatly
reduced, and the swelling

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.570 align:middle line:10%
that had been in it
that day was gone.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And then that was a huge,
wonderful thing to happen.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:10%
>>Visitors declared themselves
delighted by these displays,

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:10%
but they were astonished
to hear voices

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:10%
of what they say were
spirit personalities talking

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:10%
through the mediums.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>We had a thousand
hours of communication

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
during the Scole
Experiment, a thousand

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
hours of continuous
communication with the spirit

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Be quiet.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:03.632 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet.

00:27:03.632 --> 00:27:03.806 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet.

00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Shh.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:10%
>>Emily, when did you
live on the Earth?

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:10%
>>19th century?

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>>In this dramatic form
of spirit communication,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:10%
the mediums go into
trance, during which time

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.952 align:middle line:10%
they say spirits take over their
bodies and speak through them.

00:27:20.952 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>>It's the love
which makes people.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.957 align:middle line:84%
>>And the rest
doesn't matter a jot.

00:27:26.957 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>So what's it like
to supposedly talk

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:90%
to the dead in this way?

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>It becomes very natural.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And actually, talking to
somebody who is deceased,

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
if you like, is a natural
thing, purely and simply

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's the same as you
talking to me here in this room

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:90%
at this very moment.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no difference,
other than the fact

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.462 align:middle line:84%
that we are aware that they're
no longer in this world.

00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>And not be
frightened in any way.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>But could the mediums
have just been acting?

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.005 align:middle line:90%
The researchers didn't think so.

00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>>The voices were
quite different

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:10%
from those of the
mediums themselves,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:10%
and the personalities
behind the voices

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:10%
were not only quite different,
but were very consistent,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:10%
even the accents were.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>But it wasn't
just the consistency

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
of the accents that
impressed the researchers.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
They reported that
the personalities also

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
remembered every detail of
all conversations spoken

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to visitors over a
five-year period.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Add to those skills the
ability to read minds.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:10%
This apparently occurred
when the female spirit

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.155 align:middle line:10%
spoke to the group.

00:28:34.155 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>She would tell us what
was going to happen.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
She would comment on
what we were doing,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes what
we were thinking.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
She would answer our
questions quite frequently

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
before we had actually
asked them, which was

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:90%
quite embarrassing sometimes.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.087 align:middle line:10%
>>Thank you for your
warm appreciation,

00:28:50.087 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:10%
what you're trying to do.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:10%
>>This communicator
identified herself

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:10%
as the spirit of a
Mrs. Emily Bradshaw.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>And Mrs. Bradshaw,
who is a very commanding

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:84%
figure, a lady of the
upper class Victorian

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:90%
or Edwardian lady.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:90%
She sounded like that.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:10%
>>We continue from
our side of life

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:10%
to influence people
still in the body.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>But what evidence was there
that these voices were really

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:90%
from the deceased?

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:10%
>>We knew that we
were communicating

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:10%
with deceased personalities,
because a number of people

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:10%
who communicated with us
were able to be identified

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:10%
by independent witnesses at
the time who could testify as

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:10%
to them being people
they knew, evidence

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:10%
which couldn't possibly have
been known by anybody else.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>But what's it
like for the mediums

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to have these ethereal
communicators speak

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:90%
through them?

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Those sensations become
more and more intense

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and build up to a point where
I feel the personality actually

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.995 align:middle line:90%
taking part of my senses over.

00:29:58.995 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I become more and more
unaware of my own body,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and also more and more
unaware of my own thoughts.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>My mother died about
a year and a half

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:90%
before my father did.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And three days before
my father died,

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
he saw a vision of my mother,
and was very disturbed when

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:90%
she suddenly disappeared.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
his death coincided

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.099 align:middle line:84%
with that vision of her and
wanting to see her again.

00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Back at Scole, visitors
reported seeing and especially

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%
hearing these
objects materialize

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:90%
from out of nowhere.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:84%
In the language of
physical mediumship,

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.380 align:middle line:84%
these objects are
called apports.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>An apport is an object,
which is quite solid,

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
which is brought
from one location

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to another during an
experimental session,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
but so show doing, apparently
passes through solid walls,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.626 align:middle line:90%
doors, et cetera.

00:31:22.626 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the total
number of apports

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that we had during the
experimental sessions

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:90%
was about 80 or even more.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Whilst we were sitting
here, this object

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.660 align:middle line:84%
would arrive, just materialize,
and arrive on the table.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.104 align:middle line:84%
And as it arrived, [THUMP]
that's the sort of noise

00:31:40.104 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:90%
it would make.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Despite the fact that
witnesses heard a loud bang

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
every time an apport
arrived, no matter how small,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
skeptics have dismissed
this phenomenon as objects

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:90%
merely thrown into the air.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:10%
But the appearance
of these apports

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:10%
are not so easy to explain away.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:10%
These newspapers arrived
in pristine condition,

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:10%
despite having
originated in the 1940s.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But who might have sent it
to the Scole Group, and why?

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
The answer arrived,
they say, when

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:84%
dead British medium,
Helen Duncan,

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:84%
spoke to them via
one of the mediums.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
During World War
II, Duncan's life

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:84%
was ruined when she was
arrested and imprisoned

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:90%
for practicing mediumship.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:10%
As she described her
ordeal to the group,

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.146 align:middle line:10%
this newspaper allegedly
appeared out of nowhere.

00:32:32.146 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
[THUMP]

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
To their astonishment, displayed
prominently on its front page,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
was the story of Duncan's
trial and conviction.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>I think she suffered
greatly for her mediumship.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And she was really
coming to wish us well.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:10%
And she brought the newspaper as
a sign of a very turbulent time

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:10%
in her life.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:10%
>>The scientists knew that
an old newspaper could easily

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:10%
be copied and printed
onto a modern paper,

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:10%
so Montague Keen had the
suspect newspaper analyzed.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>We took it to the leading
research station in England,

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
indeed in the world,
on paper and printing.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely
clear from their report

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that, first of all, it was
done on letter press, which

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
has gone out of
existence virtually

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
since the early
1970s, I would say.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It was newsprint
produced during wartime,

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:84%
which lacks certain chemicals,
which you couldn't get hold of.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So this was a genuine
article, which

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:84%
appeared 50 years
after the event,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.520 align:middle line:84%
but no one has been able to
explain how it got there.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>So where did all these
apported objects come from?

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>We were told by the
spirit team that they

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, I must stress, it
changes your paradigm.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:84%
You go in thinking none
of this can be true.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But after an experience after
experience after experience,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it gradually dawns
on you, hey, there's

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
something going on
here that we can't

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.817 align:middle line:84%
explain by normal
scientific laws,

00:42:35.817 --> 00:42:37.025 align:middle line:90%
but which nevertheless exist.

00:42:37.025 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.882 align:middle line:84%
>>Years ago, I was staying
in this very old inn,

00:42:47.882 --> 00:42:51.155 align:middle line:84%
and I actually saw somebody
come out from the wall

00:42:51.155 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and walk through, and
just disappear again.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just believe
there are people

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.782 align:middle line:84%
that are trapped between
here and the next world.

00:43:00.782 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>The experiments
featured in this program

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.890 align:middle line:84%
have been described by the
scientists who witnessed them

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
as some of the best evidence
for life after death ever.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:84%
After two years
of intense effort,

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the Scole Experiment began
to produce more phenomena

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.650 align:middle line:84%
than in any mediumship
experiment in the history

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.580 align:middle line:90%
of the paranormal.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Their initial claims were
that they were in contact

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:84%
with a group of deceased
entities who were producing,

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.514 align:middle line:84%
with their help, a
number of pictures

00:43:44.514 --> 00:43:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of either deceased persons
or strips of films, which

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:84%
they claimed to be produced
without any cameras

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and in the dark.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>To eliminate any
possibility of hoaxing,

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:84%
the scientists
brought their own film

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and locked it in a specially
designed security box.

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>The box was held in the
hands of the investigators,

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:90%
so that no one could get at it.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
afterwards, we

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
would take it out
of the box ourselves

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:84%
so that no one else touched it,
and then develop it ourselves

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:90%
in a special machine.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Despite all these
precautions, the experiments

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
continued to produce the
incredible images seen here.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>They were able to achieve
whole lengths of film,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.440 align:middle line:84%
sometimes up to as
much as four feet,

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.550 align:middle line:84%
with various words,
symbols, messages--

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of different
things on that films.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Other firms contained poems
and centuries old German

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and fragments of Greek,
Chinese, Hebrew, Latin, and even

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Sanskrit.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.060 align:middle line:84%
The Scole group
were ordinary people

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.850 align:middle line:84%
with no knowledge
of these languages.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:16.078 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But did these films
have a purpose?

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.230 align:middle line:84%
If dead personalities were
producing these images,

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.190 align:middle line:84%
why did they apparently
design some of them

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.060 align:middle line:90%
as complex puzzles?

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Providing something
which is a puzzle, which

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.157 align:middle line:84%
is difficult to solve
is simply because it

00:45:31.157 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:84%
is difficult to solve, it
isn't readily available.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It can't be easily attributable
to the person sitting

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:90%
around the table.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Despite lengthy
investigations,

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:84%
the possible authors
of some of the films,

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
like this German poem,
proved impossible to trace.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But others were
easier to track down.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.020 align:middle line:84%
This one contains a
poem by Frederick Myers.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, Myers is one
of the founders of the SPR,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and a passionate researcher
into the evidence

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.490 align:middle line:90%
for life after death.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Before he died in 1901,
he promised his colleagues

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.480 align:middle line:84%
at the SPR that he
would try to communicate

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:90%
with them from the other side.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Could this film
actually represent

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.615 align:middle line:84%
evidence of the afterlife
sent by one of its greatest

00:46:18.615 --> 00:46:19.415 align:middle line:90%
investigators?

00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Mostly the researchers
were unclear as

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to who might have
created these films.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:84%
However, there were clues as to
who the ghostly authors might

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.400 align:middle line:84%
be in the form of
initials, or signatures.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.500 align:middle line:84%
For example in this
film, the signature

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:84%
appears to belong to the dead
singer and actor Ivor Novello.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This was received on
one of the Scole films.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.951 align:middle line:10%
Compare it to Novello's
actual signature.

00:46:45.951 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Investigators say these images
were created in total darkness,

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.230 align:middle line:90%
but how?

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that
those pictures can

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.310 align:middle line:84%
be explained only by imagining
that the spirits can project

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.650 align:middle line:84%
their recollections and images
onto a film in some way we

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.390 align:middle line:90%
can't begin to understand.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The only alternative explanation
is they are all fakes,

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.849 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe that there's
evidence that that is the case.

00:47:17.849 --> 00:47:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>>Although the mechanism
for their creation

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.690 align:middle line:10%
remains a mystery, investigators
concluded they were unique.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>As far as the
photographic evidence

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is concerned at Scole,
the strips of film,

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.680 align:middle line:84%
there has, in my view, never
been anything like that at all

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.480 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>As far as I'm
aware, I don't think

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.823 align:middle line:84%
there is any scientific
evidence for life after death.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Spurred on by the
photographic experiments,

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the Scole group began a
series of video experiments

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.230 align:middle line:84%
called Project
Alice, after "Alice

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Through the Looking Glass."

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Their ambition was nothing
less than to try and capture

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:08.480 align:middle line:84%
moving images sent
from the spirit world.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The Scole group insists
that instructions

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.700 align:middle line:84%
on how to position
the camera and mirrors

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.550 align:middle line:84%
came from their
spirit communicators.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.770 align:middle line:10%
They were told to set up a
video camera in the dark cellar,

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:10%
aim it at a pair of mirrors,
so that it could only

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.905 align:middle line:10%
film its own viewfinder.

00:48:23.905 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.550 align:middle line:84%
While it was recording,
nothing unusual was seen.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But when the tape
was played back,

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.420 align:middle line:84%
these remarkable
pictures appeared.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>We had images on
the video, sometimes

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.985 align:middle line:84%
of what looked like
on a tunnel of light.

00:48:43.985 --> 00:48:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Other times, spirit faces
were coming towards us.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, what appeared
to be a doorway moving.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Skeptics claim these images
were created by video feedback

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:13.110 align:middle line:84%
occurring when a camera
records its own output.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But scientists have
ruled this out.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Video feedback doesn't
produce this kind of result.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
As to what these extraordinary
pictures represent, we can only

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.010 align:middle line:84%
guess, since their
meaning was never

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:90%
explained to the Scole Group.

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:84%
This video, also
totally unexplained,

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.295 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a ghostly
face with moving eyes.

00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:42.090 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Later, a few video experiments
were attempted in full light.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, nothing unusual was
seen during the recording.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:84%
However, on playback, this
otherworldly figure appeared.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But was it possible
for the Scole Group

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.490 align:middle line:90%
to have faked these images?

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Not according to
the investigator

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.670 align:middle line:84%
who monitored these experiments,
Swiss lawyer and businessman,

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.012 align:middle line:90%
Doctor Hans Schaer.

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>There's absolutely
no possibility

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.336 align:middle line:84%
that the film could have
been prepared before,

00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:24.167 align:middle line:84%
because I selected one
of the video films, which

00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:27.275 align:middle line:84%
was in its original
packaging, which I opened.

00:50:27.275 --> 00:50:28.735 align:middle line:90%
I took the film out.

00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I signed the film, and I put it
personally in the video camera.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>He inserted it
into the camera.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We never touched at any
stage the camera or the film.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.848 align:middle line:10%
>>When he played the film,
it showed at the beginning

00:50:44.848 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:10%
a number of bubbles
of various colors.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:51:02.550 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>But there was one
particular bubble on there

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in which the face of
a person appeared,

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and it was a man
with spectacles.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Although Dr. Schaer did
not recognize this face,

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the Scole Group thought
it might have belonged

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to someone who was
trying to communicate

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.585 align:middle line:90%
with him from the afterlife.

00:51:20.585 --> 00:51:27.167 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>I have heard of the
electronic voice phenomenon.

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it's actually one of the
most disturbing and unnerving

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.682 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the notion of
there being an afterlife.

00:51:36.682 --> 00:51:39.860 align:middle line:90%
[FEEDBACK]

voices via technical devices

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:46.340 align:middle line:84%

has a long tradition that

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.180 align:middle line:90%
goes back to the last century.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, there are
tens of thousands

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of people around
the world who say

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:84%
they have captured
the voices of the dead

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.600 align:middle line:90%
on simple tape recorders.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:10%
This is known as the electronic
voice phenomena, or EVP,

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.700 align:middle line:10%
and was recently popularized in
the Hollywood blockbuster White

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.500 align:middle line:10%
Noise.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Despite the Hollywood
treatment, EVP

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:24.010 align:middle line:84%
has been the focus of serious
scientific investigation.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:27.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the leading researchers
is Alexander McRae,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
an electronics engineer who
has worked on communication

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:90%
systems for the space shuttle.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.870 align:middle line:84%
He has been investigating
EVP for decades.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>If somebody came up to
me in the street and said,

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.690 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing paranormal
about EVP, I would say,

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.880 align:middle line:84%
well, I've done at least
20 years and hundreds

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of experiments, and I know
that it is paranormal effect.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Now how many experiments
have you done?

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:10%
>>But skeptics
insist that EVP is

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.220 align:middle line:10%
nothing more than the random
pick up of broadcast signals,

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:10%
like radio and TV.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.860 align:middle line:84%
To test this theory,
McCrae try to obtain

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:84%
EVP inside a laboratory
that was fully shielded

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.500 align:middle line:90%
against radio and sound waves.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:12.370 align:middle line:84%
This meant it was impossible
to pick up any stray broadcast

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:90%
signals.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>So inside the laboratory,
you couldn't pick up anything.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But yet the device
still produced voices.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Although this audio sample
is hard to understand,

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.060 align:middle line:84%
the very fact that
it was recorded

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.475 align:middle line:84%
defies all known
laws of science.

00:53:31.475 --> 00:53:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:84%
One experimenter of
EVP is Vicky Talbot,

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.940 align:middle line:84%
who lost her son Braden in
a boating accident in 2001.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming down into
Wildcat Cove right now,

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:52.090 align:middle line:84%
which is the Cove that my
son departed from and did not

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:90%
return.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Ever since then, she says
she can record and recognize

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.379 align:middle line:84%
his voice using this
digital recorder.

00:54:02.379 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, that's Braden.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:13.230 align:middle line:84%
What has really convinced
me is the way he speaks,

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.895 align:middle line:90%
the stress, the intonation.

00:54:14.895 --> 00:54:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, he sounds
exactly as he did in life.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:22.734 align:middle line:90%
>>Happy New Year.

00:54:22.734 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:31.750 align:middle line:10%
>>He will use certain
phrases that we used to use.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>He will say
certain things that

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.715 align:middle line:84%
will identify himself as the
person that he was in life.

00:54:38.715 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I am convinced personally that
I am communicating with my son.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Like visitors to Scole
and to Bacci's center,

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.590 align:middle line:84%
EVP practitioners find
comfort in the belief

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:59.165 align:middle line:84%
that they can still
communicate with loved ones.

00:54:59.165 --> 00:55:01.960 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>But even this
conviction can't make up

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.930 align:middle line:84%
for the unbearable
burden of losing a child.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>These just make me want
to cry, just looking at him.

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:19.990 align:middle line:84%
He'll just never be this
age again, or do that again.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:25.630 align:middle line:84%
What matters is the love that
you have for your family.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:29.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what really matters,
and not to screw it up,

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and to remember they
could be gone in a flash.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, these other people,
I feel so sorry for them,

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because they have no way
of communicating with those

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.290 align:middle line:90%
that they have lost.

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And they go around thinking,
if only, if only, if only.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to think that.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:05.460 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Although EVP provides some
comfort to the bereaved,

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.580 align:middle line:84%
practitioners say that the
voices are often unclear,

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.395 align:middle line:84%
always one way and
frustratingly short.

00:56:15.395 --> 00:56:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>One way that we also
communicated with spirit,

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and which was a
very effective way,

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:32.110 align:middle line:84%
was by use of an ordinary,
very cheap tape recorder

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.890 align:middle line:84%
whose amplifiers were
used by the spirit team

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:84%
to carry on a two-way
conversation with us.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>We inspected this machine and
found it was completely normal.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, it's
built-in microphone

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:46.030 align:middle line:84%
had been removed to eliminate
the possibility of recording

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:46.920 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.810 align:middle line:10%
When the machine, which
contained a blank cassette,

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:10%
was activated, witnesses
were astonished,

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.728 align:middle line:10%
when they heard this voice
asking them a question.

00:56:55.728 --> 00:56:58.685 align:middle line:10%


00:56:58.685 --> 00:56:59.485 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

00:56:59.485 --> 00:57:03.884 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.884 --> 00:57:06.369 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHING]

00:57:06.369 --> 00:57:09.340 align:middle line:10%


00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.140 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>>Historic moment, it is.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>The Scole Group say that
their spirit communicators

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.770 align:middle line:84%
suggested ways of improving
their experiments.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:20.950 align:middle line:10%
For example, they told
Professor Ellison,

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:10%
one of the SPR
scientists, how to build

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.460 align:middle line:10%
a device for boosting
communications via the tape

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.950 align:middle line:10%
recorder.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:32.065 align:middle line:84%
But this information arrived
in a very strange way.

00:57:32.065 --> 00:57:40.270 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:43.090 align:middle line:84%
These images appeared
after an unexposed film

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:45.300 align:middle line:84%
locked in the
security box was later

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.810 align:middle line:90%
processed by the scientists.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The scientists speculated
about who was providing

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:90%
this technical information.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Their initials at
the end of the film

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.590 align:middle line:84%
seem to have solved
this mystery.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>I wrote to the Edison
Memorial people in America,

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and they sent me a copy of
one of his letters, which

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.490 align:middle line:84%
contained his
initials, which look

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.630 align:middle line:84%
almost identical to the
signature on this film.

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>This matching set of initials
convinced the researchers

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.730 align:middle line:84%
it was Thomas Edison
providing this information.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only was Edison the
world's most famous inventor,

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:27.035 align:middle line:84%
he also had an enormous
interest in the possibility

00:58:27.035 --> 00:58:27.835 align:middle line:90%
of an afterlife.

00:58:27.835 --> 00:58:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:84%
His intention to build a
machine that could communicate

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:36.470 align:middle line:84%
with the dead made
headlines around the world,

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:40.440 align:middle line:84%
but he died before
being able to build it.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.000 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
through the Scole Group,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.550 align:middle line:10%
he finally achieved this aim?

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>My understanding
of life after death

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.420 align:middle line:84%
is what we've done
here, the way we've

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.040 align:middle line:84%
affected the people about us,
and the things that we do,

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.390 align:middle line:90%
and it lives on through them.

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:04.342 align:middle line:90%


00:59:04.342 --> 00:59:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Spirit voices speaking
through the mediums.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Spirit communication written
on sealed film in locked boxes.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.870 align:middle line:84%
All of these
incredible phenomena.

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But could the scientists
have been tricked?

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Skeptics are often unaware
of the amount of experience

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of knowledge
that goes into investigations

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:22.980 align:middle line:90%
of this kind.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Between the three
investigators, you

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.950 align:middle line:84%
could say we've had
50 years and more.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.860 align:middle line:90%
We know all the tricks.

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:32.030 align:middle line:10%
>>I don't see how
it could be faked.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:39.460 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Nevertheless, was it
possible for the Scole Group

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to have perpetrated
a massive hoax?

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.152 align:middle line:84%
>>These things are so
extraordinary that when

00:59:46.152 --> 00:59:47.610 align:middle line:84%
one tells them to
people who've not

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.130 align:middle line:84%
had the experiences
themselves, they

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:50.421 align:middle line:90%
think, oh, it must be trickery.

00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge then always
is, OK, you duplicate it.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>But so far, no one has
been able to do this.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, critics still
claim that the events at Scole

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.390 align:middle line:84%
were produced by the kinds of
conjuring tricks used by stage

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.710 align:middle line:90%
magicians and entertainers.

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>You fan them in this
manner, like this, you see?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Because professional
magicians learned all the skills

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
of illusion and misdirection--

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not going to
show you how it's

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.366 align:middle line:84%
done, because if I showed
you how it was done,

01:00:22.366 --> 01:00:23.520 align:middle line:90%
you'd tell everybody else.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%

I could see no magic
props or anything

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
which made me feel
inclined to think

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
there was any hoax or trickery.

concluded that events at Scole

cannot be explained either
by known scientific laws

The debate should be about
the quality of the evidence.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, on the basis
of the available evidence,

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at all convinced that
there is such a thing as life

impossible that any one must
be rather crazy to believe it.

the evidence, you

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
have to ask yourself whether
you'd be even more crazy not

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to believe it, or to find some
alternative explanation which

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.990 align:middle line:90%

you, that light?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It's in my chest right now.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.221 align:middle line:84%
It was right there by my
heart, and I have a little bit

01:08:00.221 --> 01:08:01.710 align:middle line:90%
of a heart problem.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>I was diagnosed
with cancer and a very

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.220 align:middle line:90%
fast-moving, dangerous cancer.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I sat with Scole, and probably
two to three weeks later, I

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
had biopsies again, and they
came back completely negative.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>All of the visitors
are attending

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
the LA session said
the experience changed

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
their lives forever.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>When you walk out of
the room, you definitely

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
feel like you've been exposed
to something very extraordinary.

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:31.815 align:middle line:90%
>>We actually saw the spirits.

01:08:31.815 --> 01:08:34.550 align:middle line:90%


01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's got to be positive
evidence for survival.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>We do live on after death.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
They certainly proved
that to us that night.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Being survived in Auschwitz,
and also my parents were killed

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
in Auschwitz, including
my 11-year-old brother,

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
who was killed on
arrival with my parents,

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and I just cannot accept that
that should be the end of them.

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:17.939 align:middle line:90%


01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:20.069 align:middle line:84%
>>Previously, we have
shown how experiments

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:24.823 align:middle line:84%
at Scole and with Bacci provide
powerful evidence for life

01:09:24.823 --> 01:09:25.623 align:middle line:90%
after death.

01:09:25.623 --> 01:09:29.487 align:middle line:90%


01:09:29.487 --> 01:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But some researchers
think there may be

01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:33.597 align:middle line:90%
another possible explanation.

01:09:33.597 --> 01:09:38.680 align:middle line:90%


01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Could some of the remarkable
events shown in this film

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
be the result of human
paranormal abilities

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
like psychokinesis, the
claimed ability of the mind

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.313 align:middle line:90%
to directly affect matter.

01:09:50.313 --> 01:09:52.729 align:middle line:10%
>>There's an enormous amount
of evidence for the existence

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:53.880 align:middle line:10%
of psychokinesis.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
In the laboratory,
we're talking mainly

01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
about the evidence of human
consciousness on random number

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
generators and very small events
that can be totally controlled.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.767 align:middle line:84%
There is clear evidence that
people can affect things.

01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most
famous practitioners

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of psychokinesis, or PK,
is a Russian housewife

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.876 align:middle line:90%
called Nina Kulagina.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:15.672 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.672 --> 01:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Kulagina was able to
demonstrate her abilities

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.826 align:middle line:84%
under strictly controlled
conditions in front

01:10:20.826 --> 01:10:21.825 align:middle line:90%
of a team of scientists.

01:10:21.825 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Researchers who investigated
her were convinced she

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
was able to do this solely
by the power of her mind.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So could the Scole Group and
their visitors unwittingly

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
have created some or
all of the phenomena

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:41.000 align:middle line:90%
using mind over matter?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>As an explanation, although
it's not more than just

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
simply a label to it, this
is psychokinesis and physical

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
mediumship, whether it is a
spirit working through someone,

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
a spirit acting
directly on an object,

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
or the medium's mind
causing the things to move.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Say there were real mind
over matter effects going

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
on as supposed to
conjuring tricks?

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Then how do we know
they were coming

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
from the minds of the
disembodied people,

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than from the
minds of the mediums who

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:09.100 align:middle line:90%
were sitting in the room?

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>There is no definitive
answer to this question,

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
but the theory that
these phenomena were

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
due solely to psychokinesis
from the living

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
seems improbable, since PK
produced in laboratories

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.190 align:middle line:90%
tends to be weak.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, mind over
matter from the living

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
is unlikely to explain the
huge range of phenomena

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.644 align:middle line:90%
featured in this film.

01:11:31.644 --> 01:11:36.374 align:middle line:90%


01:11:36.374 --> 01:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Emily, when did you
live on the Earth?

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.516 align:middle line:10%
>>Oh, a long time ago now.

01:11:39.516 --> 01:11:41.010 align:middle line:10%
>>19th century?

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.160 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>We simply have a number
of clues of information

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
which was extremely
unlikely to have derived

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
from the subconscious
mind or the conscious mind

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
of the medium.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more
impressive those are,

01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
the less likely it is that you
can say that this is an aspect

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
of mediumship, and the more
likely it is it's an aspect

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of [? disconic ? ]
communication.

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:13.244 align:middle line:90%


01:12:13.244 --> 01:12:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Previously, we traveled
with the Scole Group

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
to Italy, where they first
met with Marcelo Bacci.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:24.135 align:middle line:84%
They say they were able to talk
to the spirits via his radio.

01:12:24.135 --> 01:12:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Come on, who's this?

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>Come on, on here.

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:30.600 align:middle line:90%


01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.400 align:middle line:10%
>>Timestream?

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.970 align:middle line:90%


01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>But when the
school group visited

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Bacci in a later session,
he was having problems.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
For months, hundreds
of people who

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
came from around the world
in the hope of hearing

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
their dead loved ones were
bitterly disappointed.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.600 align:middle line:90%
All they heard was static.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Bacci was depressed.

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:57.021 align:middle line:84%
He feared he had lost
his unique talent.

01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Then, in an extraordinary
piece of luck,

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
as our cameras rolled
in an interview

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
with Bacci, the radio which
had been silent for so long,

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.422 align:middle line:90%
burst into life.

01:13:10.422 --> 01:13:13.150 align:middle line:10%
>>[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:44.230 align:middle line:90%


01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Bacci's drought was over.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:49.514 align:middle line:84%
When the radio voice stopped,
there was celebration.

01:13:49.514 --> 01:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Bacci felt he'd
regained his ability

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the spirits.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.220 align:middle line:90%


01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But then joy turned
to disappointment

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
as he thought he had
failed to record the voice.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.050 align:middle line:10%
>>[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%


01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Once the recording
was transcribed,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Bacci told us the voice
belonged to a spirit

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
called Gregorio,
a Catholic Friar

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.350 align:middle line:90%
who had died many years ago.

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Later, independent
researcher Dr. Toriello,

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.750 align:middle line:84%
read the last part of
this ghostly message.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Man, he passed he time
just deceiving himself.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But when all of you, you
will be here where we are,

01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
then you will find answer
to all your questions.

01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I cannot say more.

01:14:56.210 --> 01:15:03.130 align:middle line:90%


01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>We do look down our
friends and loved ones

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:08.720 align:middle line:84%
after we die, until
such time as we move

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.900 align:middle line:90%
on to some other dimension.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I think you can think
what you like, really.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:28.150 align:middle line:90%


01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Despite the evidence
from Scole and Bacci--

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>--most scientists still
refuse to even consider

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
consciousness might survive

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.810 align:middle line:90%
death.

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, the
internationally-renowned

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
biologist and Scole investigator
offers an explanation.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a dominant
materialism in science

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that grew up in
the 19th century.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It's become part of
the culture of science,

01:15:56.830 --> 01:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
but it's really a dogmatic
belief system rather than

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:02.360 align:middle line:90%
a testable theory.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>What this means
is that scientists

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have become completely
focused on the things

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
they can both measure
and replicate in labs.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Within science, based on
the materialist point of view,

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.620 align:middle line:90%
the mind is the brain.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
suggests the mind

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.915 align:middle line:84%
might be more than the brain
goes against the theory,

01:16:19.915 --> 01:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and therefore most scientists
don't want to know about it.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Another prominent
scientist not convinced

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is solely
the result of brain activity

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.550 align:middle line:90%
is Dr. Charles Tart.

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>That's just a small
part of the spectrum.

01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tart is Emeritus
Professor of Psychology

01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California and a leading

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
researcher into the evidence
for life after death.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>The idea that survival of
bodily death is impossible

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and that we're nothing
but our brains and bodies

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is really a function of an
outmoded view in science,

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.234 align:middle line:90%
a Newtonian worldview.

01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:55.510 align:middle line:90%


01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Newtonian
worldview works very well

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.790 align:middle line:90%
for everyday events.

01:16:58.790 --> 01:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most interesting
things about modern science,

01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:05.451 align:middle line:84%
especially when you look at
stuff like quantum theory,

01:17:05.451 --> 01:17:07.742 align:middle line:84%
is that the world is far more
mysterious than we think.

01:17:07.742 --> 01:17:13.406 align:middle line:90%


01:17:13.406 --> 01:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And we now have
experimental evidence

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
of what Einstein called
spooky action at a distance,

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that we could instantaneously
affect something

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
in a distant part
of the universe.

01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:26.510 align:middle line:90%
That's really wild.

01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness has any of
the qualities of this quantum

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
level of existence,
then phenomena

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.991 align:middle line:84%
like survival of bodily
death are probably not

01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:36.990 align:middle line:90%
so mysterious after all.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%


01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But could quantum
theory explain one

01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
of the most shocking
experiments conducted at Scole?

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>This particular
experiment was perhaps

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
the most important experiment
of the whole series.

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Previously, we
showed how visitors

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.966 align:middle line:84%
reported seeing these balls
of light appear before them.

01:18:14.966 --> 01:18:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>It's like fireworks.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>On this occasion, one of
them flew inside a large quartz

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.720 align:middle line:90%
crystal.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>The crystal then levitated.

01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
We could see it glowing,
and then descended

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.120 align:middle line:90%
into a Pyrex bowl.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Then Arthur Ellison was
invited to pick it up.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.173 align:middle line:84%
He picked it up and satisfied
himself that it was there,

01:18:36.173 --> 01:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was glowing, and
he put it down again.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
He was asked right away to
pick it up again, he tried to,

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and his fingers
closed right over it.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It had dematerialized.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>There's nothing there.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it looks the same.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.104 align:middle line:90%
But there's nothing there.

01:18:51.104 --> 01:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Then he was asked
to pick it up again,

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and it rematerialized
in his hand.

01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%


01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.396 align:middle line:90%
>>Ah, it feels crystal now.

01:18:57.396 --> 01:18:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Now, this dumbfounded him.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what finally
convinced him

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that this was real,
because it couldn't

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:04.920 align:middle line:90%
have been faked in any way.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had his head right
over the top of the bowl

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:11.760 align:middle line:84%
in order to ensure that
no hand or no instrument

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.137 align:middle line:90%
could interfere with it.

01:19:15.137 --> 01:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Of course, we were
totally amazed by this.

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:19.466 align:middle line:84%
Things do not materialize
and dematerialize.

01:19:19.466 --> 01:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
This is against all
the laws of nature.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
We are trained
scientists, of course.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We know how the
world behaves, and it

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't behave like that.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>But what does this
remarkable demonstration

01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
tell us about what might
happen after death?

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>The spirit team told
us that the experiment

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
with the crystal in the bowl
gave a good example of what

01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
happened when we die, in that
the essence of the crystal

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
remained, even when the
physical part of the crystal

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.356 align:middle line:90%
had been removed.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.985 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies represent
the physical,

01:19:54.985 --> 01:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
but the essence of
ourselves remains the same.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
This, if you like,
can be termed the soul

>>If I believe in the
possibility of life

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.654 align:middle line:84%
after death, what do I
think would happen after?

01:20:23.654 --> 01:20:25.088 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

than pure death.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I would rather not
believe in survival.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But I find it impossible
to be intellectually honest

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and not believe in survival.

But this gave us the opportunity
of testing whether or not

01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
he actually got his
wish for oblivion.

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:04.506 align:middle line:84%
This came in the form
of Allison DuBois.

01:21:04.506 --> 01:21:06.890 align:middle line:10%
DuBois has become one of

>>The fact that he gets to
still be here around the people

01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:56.980 align:middle line:90%
he loves is huge to him.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Although many of DuBois'
statements were vague,

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
some were
astonishingly accurate.

at the podium like [SNAPPING],

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.710 align:middle line:84%
like [SNAPPING], and falls,
and he goes down to the podium.

01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>This is important.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%

While defending his

>>Now, I don't even
know what it means.

I mean, he's making me feel like
either he had a heart attack,

or his breath was
taken from him.

>>Also, there would have been
like, a banner announcement,

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:13.120 align:middle line:10%

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.340 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it was.

he's like, way to go out.

You know, like, way
to leave this world.

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, right there and then.

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
DuBois stated that Kean is now
as interested in communicating

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.330 align:middle line:84%

guys are seeing that's right,

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and what's not right, and
almost to like, try and help

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.390 align:middle line:90%
make that clearer.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what that life
will look like, if we just

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
go back into the source.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%

to question whether the

in this film represent
convincing evidence

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
grieving parents
continue to report

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
hearing the voices of their
dead children on Bacci's radio.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:16.090 align:middle line:90%


01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And Vicky Talbot's
says she continues

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:25.450 align:middle line:10%
to receive the voice of her
deceased son, Braden, via EVP.

01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>But the debate about the
authenticity and significance

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of this evidence
continues to rage.

01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:36.195 align:middle line:10%
>>Now according to science,
when you physically die

01:25:36.195 --> 01:25:39.220 align:middle line:10%
and when your brain stops
functioning, that is it.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
That is the end.

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>The experiences that
I've had have convinced me

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that it is very difficult to
explain any of these things

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
by an alternative explanation
to that of survival.

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>You're not going
to win everybody.

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not
going to be able to ever

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
have everybody believe
that there's another side.

01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:56.150 align:middle line:90%
That's just not going to happen.

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>I hope the significance
of those experiments

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
will literally be to make
people think, to stop and think,

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
look at their own lives, look
at where they're going, perhaps

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
to be better people.

01:26:09.850 --> 01:27:03.600 align:middle line:90%
