>>If it was just someone
with the own eyes,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.296 align:middle line:90%
they could exaggerate.

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:06.830 align:middle line:10%
But this only takes pictures
of what is actually there.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It cannot lie.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.887 align:middle line:10%
>>I don't know what it is.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.969 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something
I've ever filmed before.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I've never filmed
anything like that.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.532 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.532 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>>There's all sorts of
scientific possibilities

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.698 align:middle line:10%
as to what they could be
and what could be happening.

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:28.928 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason
why the-- it's impossible

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that a dimensional rift
of some sort's happening.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:10%
>>What we're looking
at is a life form.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.692 align:middle line:10%
From the time they
are moved very fast.

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:10%
You can see them in a split
of a second, and they're gone.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:10%
They are part of, how should I
say, hidden spectrum of life.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:10%
Which is existing partly
physically, partly etherically.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.416 align:middle line:84%
>>Now ancient cultures had names
for other dimensional lives

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
such as fairies,
angels, pixies, divas.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.436 align:middle line:10%
When you say a
biological organism,

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:07.086 align:middle line:10%
would you say that it's falling
into this type of category?

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:07.886 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, definitely.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:08.686 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:29.791 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Something just flashed
past you Isabelle.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.145 align:middle line:90%
It was so fast.

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what it was,
but I saw it definitely.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.378 align:middle line:10%
And I think I got it
on the video and--

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:42.154 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:45.242 align:middle line:10%
>>When we were on the
beach last night, and--

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>>Tim, you got a shot.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.496 align:middle line:10%
>>Yeah.

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it looked like it.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we were just-- we
were doing this session

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:84%
with Isabelle, and making
all these pictures in a row

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.642 align:middle line:84%
while she was throwing--
throwing the apple in the air.

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, like, in
between these different photos,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
there was this one
photo which popped out.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
This little-- you could
see like a yellowish orb.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
In front of her, a
tree on the background.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.602 align:middle line:90%
So it was-- yeah.

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was pretty
strange, actually.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the video
of Isabelle, we

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:90%
saw another one, another light.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And the video showed the
flash of it, All the lines,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
those spikes coming out of it.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was a very
strange object.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Not anything I've
ever seen before.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:10%
It's not my area of
expertise, but it's still

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:10%
not something you can
easily explain, I think.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:10%
>>Maybe it's just
my energy floating

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.703 align:middle line:10%
around me, just not in my body.

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
But just going out of my body.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.582 align:middle line:84%
>>I just saw something
with my eye then.

00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:02.685 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Going out of my body
without me knowing it.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.731 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>That light's flashing
around you, and what's next?

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.152 align:middle line:84%
>>I think like an enormous
UFO coming to get me,

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to get me to another
planet maybe.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, Mark just
aimed at the sky,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.415 align:middle line:84%
and took a shot
with this camera.

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:03.065 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there
was an image on there.

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely a
disk of some kind.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're looking
at this thing,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:10%
thinking, hang on a second.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:10%
This is taking a
picture of something

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:10%
that yet your naked
eye looks in the sky,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:10%
and there's nothing there.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So in total disbelief,
you know, we

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
had to get our jaws
off the ground.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We then you know, decided OK,
let's take another picture.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.756 align:middle line:84%
But he said, this time you take
the camera, and take a shot.

00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there
was another object.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a bit different
than the other one,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.023 align:middle line:84%
but it had a bit of a
gullwing sort of shape.

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And it was actually
on an angle like this.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:10%
And, we were just bamboozled.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.723 align:middle line:10%
It even had a glow to it.

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And cameras don't lie.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:10%
They only take pictures
of what's actually there.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.955 align:middle line:84%
So it made us realize what
if there is a presence here

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know about that's
actually cloaking itself,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
watching us, just being totally
discrete and out of the way.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:10%
>>I hope they're not like evil
aliens coming to attack me.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:10%
So they rather-- I'd
rather like to see

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:10%
that they're nice little
creatures than like,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:10%
mean angry aliens.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.914 align:middle line:84%
So I hope they're like-- well
they have a positive energy.

00:05:20.914 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:10%
>>This film is
about photographing

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:10%
these mysterious life forms
which appear around our bodies.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Which we only shoot at
dusk, just about this time,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.879 align:middle line:84%
just after sunset, from the
beaches north of Bryant Bay

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:90%
in Australia's northeast coast.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
The lights appear
in strange places,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
like inside the car as
we're going on a film shoot

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to try to capture them.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's strange times.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, when we are
talking about them

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and interviewing people about
their experiences with them.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.583 align:middle line:10%
>>This camera to
capture the raw image

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in three-dimensional form.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And as I'm looking at it
now, and actually scrolling

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:10%
through a couple of images.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>I've been filming since 1979.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I've been all over the world.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:10%
I've never filmed
anything like that.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.924 align:middle line:84%
>>What are the
conventional possibilities?

00:06:40.924 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the only thing that I
can think of that it could be

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
would be an insect of some kind.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.638 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very fast.

00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>Faster than insect?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Turbo charged insect!

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Going the wrong way too.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.818 align:middle line:90%
Look, it's going straight down.

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Unexplainable.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.285 align:middle line:90%
Very, very fast.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
It's very odd that it happens
during your interviews.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:10%
>>Scientists like
astrophysicist Dr.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Massimo Teodorani related the
life forms that we've been

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:10%
capturing on film have similar
characteristics to the plasma

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:10%
type phenomena he and
others have been researching

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:10%
in the Hessdalen Valley in
Norway since the 1980's.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:10%
In Hessdalen, the
anomalous lights

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:10%
appear floating in the night
sky above mountain streams

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.476 align:middle line:10%
and forest parks.

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:10%
The lights we have
been capturing

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:10%
on Australia's
northeast coast often

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:10%
appear to be directly
interactive and in very

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:10%
close proximity.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.825 align:middle line:10%
Does this bio-interaction
suggest a sentient presence?

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:10%
Are we photographing
and interacting

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:10%
with a type of non
physical intelligence

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.596 align:middle line:10%
not known to modern science?

00:07:57.596 --> 00:08:00.105 align:middle line:90%
If so, why are they here?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:18.073 align:middle line:84%
>>There were these lights
which was quite amazing.

00:08:18.073 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you think after viewing
the images and video that

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
were taken at the same time,
that we may have captured

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
an intelligence that is beyond
conventional understanding?

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- I mean there's
every possibility, I think.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.224 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's very possible.

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what other
explanation could there be?

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
trickery with the camera.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.272 align:middle line:84%
And there's no you know,
sort of slight of hand.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you have
to think that there's

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be some sort of
explanation like that.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Um, I think people would be
fairly close minded if they

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.078 align:middle line:84%
thought that we were the only
intelligence in the universe.

00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:10%
>>The first time when
I arrived in Byron Bay,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:10%
I was thinking this
city was very special

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.856 align:middle line:10%
and I really felt
a special energy.

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:07.742 align:middle line:10%
And, yeah, after I met
Mark, this producer,

00:09:07.742 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:10%
I went with him to take picture.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.775 align:middle line:90%
And the light appear around me.

00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I think they are
really intelligent

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and they come from somewhere
very special place.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't think in France.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe in France, I could
see this kind of light.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
because this place is

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.362 align:middle line:84%
really natural and spiritual
and there is so much energy.

00:09:38.362 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of you will
see this movie we've

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
seen that it's impossible to
see this kind of light on Earth.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it's
possible because I saw it.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes I was just reading
a book on the beach,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and so very focused on the book.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Was Ayurvedic book.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So very natural and
healthy book I think.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I saw around book light,
who just do like that.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.444 align:middle line:90%
Left, right, left, right.

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Turn on, turn.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:90%
With all, like, this form.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, turn with energy.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.594 align:middle line:84%
Into the light,
like, other light...

00:10:33.594 --> 00:10:34.664 align:middle line:90%
very, very strange.

00:10:34.664 --> 00:10:37.292 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what was that.

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.946 align:middle line:84%
>>We came to the beach here
just north of Byron Bay at dusk

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
and we filmed.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.624 align:middle line:84%
And we captured more lights
with her on that first shoot

00:10:43.624 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:90%
than with anyone previously.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:50.486 align:middle line:90%

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And the lights we
captured around her

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
they had distinct
characteristics, geometry,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.979 align:middle line:84%
Really unique and putting
them in the category

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:07.444 align:middle line:90%
of this unexplained phenomena.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.584 align:middle line:84%
Here we are with Mathilde
with her passion.

00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:39.155 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:40.488 align:middle line:90%
You can try and nothing happens.

00:11:40.488 --> 00:11:41.964 align:middle line:90%
And you think, oh it's so silly.

00:11:41.964 --> 00:11:42.948 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's happening.

00:11:42.948 --> 00:11:43.932 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:44.916 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fantasy.

00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
an image appears.

00:11:51.422 --> 00:12:27.582 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>We danced to the rhythm
of the Earth and sky.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And they come.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.266 align:middle line:90%

00:13:04.055 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:90%
It was like a revelation for me.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.853 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
they are intelligence

00:13:09.853 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
from natural world,
but not from this one.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:10%
Maybe ancient cultures saw them
also and they danced together.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Another shoot, we
captured this light down

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:90%
into Mathilde's right.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And had this unique
geometry, it's

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
like composed of
these segmented forms.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Two shapes to the right of
the central orange form.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.981 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>After shooting, I
look at my picture.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:10%
This light on my life
looking like a butterfly

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.326 align:middle line:10%
from the future.

00:13:45.326 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
In the same day, we capture
two different but similar life

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
forms around me.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
One near to my head, two
others close next to my legs.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:10%
I was surprised about those
two forms very close to me.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:10%
Trying to find a
kind of explanation,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:10%
I believe planet and
astrology and other knowledge

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:09.061 align:middle line:10%
from India like history
about old civilization life.

00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:12.345 align:middle line:84%
Got a very strong
link with the light.

00:14:12.345 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And I think naturally sense
can come into human chakra,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:10%
evolving soul and permit
it to see the light.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:27.046 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>>And if we look at the raw
unprocessed files straight out

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:10%
of the camera, the
earlier shots taken

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:10%
show the blue sphere
apparently traversing across

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.564 align:middle line:10%
towards Mathilde, and then down
and to her right near her leg.

00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
The later shots taken show
Mathilde raising her arms

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:90%
in the air to a curved u-shape.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.958 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The next image taken, as
Mathilde half closes her eyes,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
shows the unexplained
light energy form.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
In the same shape as
her curved raised arms.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:10%
Scientists studying the
luminous light phenomenon

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:10%
in the Hessdalen
Valley in Norway

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:10%
report that after firing
lasers towards the lights

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:10%
that light pulses
would be returned.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Could a similar
intelligent interaction

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
be happening between
Mathilde and the lights?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Mimicking her body
positions, and perhaps

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
communicating with her through
some kind of symbolic language.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>It's something that I
haven't really seen before.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And based on the close up shots,
honestly I cannot come up with

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:90%
anything that would explain it.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.027 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:36.027 --> 00:15:37.443 align:middle line:10%
Definitely I think--
definitely it

00:15:37.443 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:10%
hasn't been manipulated simply
because it's a raw file.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it's
a raw file, it's

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.217 align:middle line:84%
simply not possible to
edit it and be a raw file.

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, raw
files are the only things

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that are submitted in court
for forensic evidence.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.939 align:middle line:10%
They cannot be adjusted.

00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:10%
If it's adjusted in any way,
it ceases to become a raw,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:10%
and it becomes a JPEG or a TIFF.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:10%
>>It's not possible if
it's lens flare simply

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:10%
because it wouldn't
turn up looking

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:10%
the same on both cameras.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>So is there any conventional
photographic explanation?

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.856 align:middle line:10%
>>This doesn't have the
characteristics of lens blur

00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:14.224 align:middle line:10%
doesn't look anything like it.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:10%
In regards to dust on the
sensor, dust on the sensor

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.986 align:middle line:10%
would turn up in every image.

00:16:18.986 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have just
been one or two images.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Showing up like
this, it certainly

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.631 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be in both cameras.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:10%
In regards to dust on
the lens, it would not

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:10%
turn up looking like that.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:10%
>>And of course it wouldn't
be in both still and video

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.066 align:middle line:10%
as well?

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:35.866 align:middle line:10%
>>Exactly.

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:10%
It just simply wouldn't
be on both images

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.469 align:middle line:10%
because it can only
be on one camera.

00:16:40.469 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:10%
The only way it can be
there if it isn't actually

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:10%
there, something has
to be there to turn up

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:10%
on two different
cameras look the same.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:10%
And what it is is something
that's open to you know,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:10%
definition and explanation.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>>My dad's a chiropractor.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.813 align:middle line:10%
And he works with
principles of Ayurveda,

00:17:09.813 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:10%
ancient Indian medicine,
and philosophy.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I know that from
Ayurveda, the teachings

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
indicate that there are
other dimensions, possibly

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:90%
other beings than human.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.135 align:middle line:84%
I guess that every time we
capture one of these lights

00:17:23.135 --> 00:17:26.575 align:middle line:84%
confirms my dad's views
that everything is energy,

00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that there may be something
more beyond the physical body.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm open to that too.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:90%
My dad's a surfer.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.652 align:middle line:84%
Loves nature and capturing
these frequencies.

00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:10%
I've been reading about
the scientific research

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.619 align:middle line:10%
from Norway, where the
scientists who Mark have been

00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:10%
writing to and
sending the images to,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:10%
are conducting field studies
with equipment, radar,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.745 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:10%
>>The anomalous phenomenon
occur very often

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.221 align:middle line:10%
in some specific areas of Earth.

00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
There is area of Earth which
can be considered a laboratory.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:90%
So the phenomenon is there.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And we can expect to
observe very often.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.992 align:middle line:10%
And so we can apply just
there our instrumentation.

00:18:11.992 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been reading
a research paper

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Teodorani
which Mark gave to me,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
about the Norwegian lights which
appear similar to the Byron

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:90%
lights.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that there's a
lot of research that has been

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:90%
going on about this phenomena.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Energy he is a
very important thing

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:10%
which we can bring
for our necessities.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:10%
So if we understand
the physics which

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:10%
is based on this
phenomenon, then we

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.605 align:middle line:10%
can try to reproduce in a
laboratory this physics,

00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:10%
and probably make a
sort of revolution

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:10%
in the energetic
system of humanity.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.116 align:middle line:84%
>>We went down to beach
at dusk for a shoot,

00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and we put fruit on the sand
and started taking photographs.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:90%
And at first, nothing happened.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Then I started
throwing up the ball

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
as if I was serving
a tennis ball.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
in the photographs,

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
there was lights in
between me and the camera.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:10%
>>The Byron Bay phenomenon
is very, very important.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:10%
Because with only
simple videos, it's

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.936 align:middle line:10%
possible to make a good science.

00:19:16.936 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:10%
Regarding conventional objects
from the nature point of view,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:10%
there is no possible
reference to what

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:10%
we're seeing in
Hessdalen or in Byron Bay

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.916 align:middle line:10%
or in other places in the world.

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:36.085 align:middle line:90%
>>That was the beginning.

00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, whenever
we go to shoot,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
we always bring apples
and throw them up.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:45.182 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.182 --> 00:19:47.892 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a strange thing,
but it seems to work.

00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Tom's accidental throwing
tennis ball capturing life form

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
discovery may have an actual
physiological subtle energetic

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:90%
basis.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I sent Dr. Massino
Teodorani the video

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of Tom with the luminous
high velocity form taken

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.086 align:middle line:90%
at the beach north of Byron.

00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Teodorani
replied in an e-mail

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that the phenomenon may be a
sort of plasma like life form.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And that as plasmas are
highly quantum coherent forms,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
this might give rise to
consciousness and intelligence,

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
including interaction
with our brains,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
which are in their turn, quantum
coherence structures given

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.322 align:middle line:90%
by microtubule entanglement.

00:20:27.322 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The muscle that controls
upward eye movement,

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
as in throwing up a
tennis ball or apple,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:90%
is the inferior oblique.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
This muscle receives
its nerve innervation

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
from the third cranial
nerve, the ocular motor

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
nerve, whose nucleus is in the
midbrain, part of the brain

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
stem.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The brain stem is associated
with maintaining consciousness.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps Dr. Teodorani's theory
about intelligent plasma

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
lifeforms interacting with
our brains was correct.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And that by continual activation
of the cranial mid-brain

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
nucleus, through
repeatedly looking upward,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
catching a tennis
ball or apple, a kind

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
of brain chemistry
subtle energetic

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
pathway was
established, leading to

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:90%
enhanced subtle communications.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Similar, perhaps, to the
meditative alpha brain wave

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.705 align:middle line:84%
state experienced in meditation
and in repetitive activity,

00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
including surfing, where
the outer mind is quiet

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.088 align:middle line:84%
and the mind becomes more
receptive to inner, higher self

00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:23.888 align:middle line:90%
influence.

00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:10%
All theories aside,
as Tom said, crazy

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:10%
as it may be, looking upwards
as we threw apples or tennis

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:10%
balls to the sky,
did seem to work,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:10%
as we captured more and more
of the mysterious light forms

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.825 align:middle line:10%
on the stills and video clips.

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Later that month,
in October 2007,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.272 align:middle line:84%
I invited documentary
filmmaker and cinemetographer,

00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
David Warth, to come and
film with me at dusk.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:10%
David Warth is a multi
award winning producer

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:10%
whose wildlife films regularly
appear on Australia's ABC

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:10%
television network.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.408 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, none of
us would have long to wait.

00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:12.745 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:16.442 align:middle line:84%
Within a minute, the first video
and still capture was recorded.

00:22:16.442 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:10%
The high res 12 megapixel
still images taken by David

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously as a video
showed beautiful rainbow colors,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:10%
ethereal forms.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:33.412 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.412 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Another still image showed
a large spherical shape

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:10%
over my right foot with
another much smaller rainbow

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:10%
sphere a meter or
two away on the sand.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The sphere above my
foot did not have

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the concentric internal
shapes commonly seen

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.915 align:middle line:84%
with what's become
known as orbs, which

00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Teodorani believed to be
out of focus dust particles

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:90%
or water droplets.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Although many have
confused these

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
with real unexplained
phenomenon.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the forms, captured
only a few inches away

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
from the apple I
was throwing, looked

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.815 align:middle line:84%
like a pastel,
rainbow colored dove

00:23:03.815 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
made of some unknown and
smooth, shiny matter.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
The most intriguing
image captured by David

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
as I tossed my apple high
into the late afternoon sky

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
was of a small shape
inches from my face

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
which cast a distinct
shadow just near my mouth

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:90%
on the right side.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Light does not cast shadows.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Did this image confirm that
these light phenomena were not

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
life forms at all,
but actually solid,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:90%
three dimensional objects?

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Teodorani had written
about an object which

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be three
dimensional and also made

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:10%
of what he described as a
shiny alabaster like substance.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>>By studying videos and
from the high resolution

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:10%
photographs or so, the
luminosity distribution

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:10%
is not typical of
the plasma which

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:10%
should be Gaussian and
exponential in the wings

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:10%
of this plot, which is a three
dimensional plot, which we use

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:10%
to try to study how the
luminosity is distributed

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:10%
on the light surface.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:10%
We noticed that it
doesn't resemble

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:10%
at all a normal plasma,
like an star would be.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:10%
The light distribution
is very steep.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.205 align:middle line:10%
And it is typical of a uniformly
illuminated solid body.

00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:10%
>>After the successful
shoot with David Warth,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:10%
I felt that the journey into
the unknown was just beginning.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I contacted two friends, Byron
Bay jeweler Jacob Bravenboer,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.086 align:middle line:90%
and Peter Murphy.

00:24:37.086 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:84%
With his long flowing
beard, Peter himself

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
looked like a wizened
visitor from a hidden realm.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
While Jacob, melting gold
and silver at his anvil,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
always reminded me of an elvish
Middle Kingdom craftsman.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:10%
>>Since Mark showed
me the pictures

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:10%
he'd been taking of some
phenomena that were showing up

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.955 align:middle line:10%
as little lights on the film
at the beach and in the forest,

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:10%
I decided to have a go with
my own little digital camera.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:10%
And see what was
in our back yard.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:10%
On our very first go, I got
some amazing images of long,

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
almost like a
fluorescent rug type

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.195 align:middle line:10%
light that would appear
in several frames, three

00:25:16.195 --> 00:25:17.546 align:middle line:10%
consecutive frames.

00:25:17.546 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:10%
And almost looked like it had
some strange sort of propulsion

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:10%
device at the end of it once
you blow the picture up.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Since then, we've got some thin
rods coming down vertically

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:10%
and at 45 degrees.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And lots of round lights.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And has sort of
learned to see them

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
without having to use the
camera at times, and since then.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So, the spot in my little back
yard and the Arakwal National

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
park became a spot of
interest for both of us.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They're definitely nice
friendly, fairy-like feeling

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:90%
creatures.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:10%
I'd rather have
them there than not.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.895 align:middle line:10%
The little lights feel like
they have a life of their own.

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:10%
There's all sorts of
scientific possibilities

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.068 align:middle line:10%
as to what they could be
and what could be happening.

00:26:07.068 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's no reason
why it's impossible

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.165 align:middle line:10%
that a dimensional rift
of some sort is happening.

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:10%
I think that what we
call the fourth dimension

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:10%
is basically an interface
between incarnate beings

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.645 align:middle line:10%
and non incarnate beings.

00:26:22.645 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And that you can see the
bits of the interface

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:10%
show up sometimes.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.971 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's what
their little lights,

00:26:30.971 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:10%
orbs if you want to call
them, or that could be called

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.450 align:middle line:10%
portals.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:10%
They could be little
mini spaceships.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:10%
They could be little micro
creatures from either here

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:10%
or another planet.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
They could be-- I think
that life thrives absolutely

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.482 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious about that
in the most extreme conditions.

00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So I certainly don't
limit life to having

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
it be relying on water or oxygen
or any of those basic things.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.764 align:middle line:84%
And it just adds to the
wonder and marvel and beauty

00:26:59.764 --> 00:27:00.755 align:middle line:90%
of the uni verse.

00:27:00.755 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:10%
>>What were your feelings
when you looked at the images

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:10%
after we shot the
shoot and there's

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:10%
these lights near your head
and flashing around you?

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>How did Mark put
that on the film?

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.298 align:middle line:10%
>>You got the technology.

00:27:15.298 --> 00:27:18.626 align:middle line:10%
>>Well give me the technology.

00:27:18.626 --> 00:27:20.105 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.066 align:middle line:90%
We're ready.

00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.656 align:middle line:84%
>>For about half an hour, I
threw that apple up in the air.

00:27:29.656 --> 00:27:34.256 align:middle line:84%
Mark took video footage
as well as stills.

00:27:34.256 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>I sent the footage
to the scientist...

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.592 align:middle line:84%
to my friend Masinno
the scientist in Italy.

00:27:39.592 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote back and said,
definitely not insects.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Micro luminescence.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.195 align:middle line:90%
Intelligent plasma.

00:27:45.195 --> 00:28:14.515 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.515 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>They're everywhere.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere right now.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.325 align:middle line:90%
But they're small.

00:28:18.325 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
If we could just get
a massive huge one.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.606 align:middle line:84%
>>We went back and
sat in the car.

00:28:25.606 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And we went back
through the stills

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that he took and
rewound the footage.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:37.973 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.973 --> 00:28:41.917 align:middle line:10%
Those lights appeared
around my head.

00:28:41.917 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:10%
I don't know where
they came from.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:10%
There was nobody
there with torches

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:10%
or any lightening effects.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, that
stuff was just there.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:10%
The communication about
them is that they're

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:10%
intelligent plasma.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I can honestly
say that I've never

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:10%
been with an intelligent
plasma to my knowledge.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Mini universes, bubbling
inside, creating God knows what.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Havoc.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, sitting
on the outside,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
truly wondering whether it's
I who bring all this about.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Or whether there's
some peculiar reasons,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
it's just chemical interaction
that creates function.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.058 align:middle line:84%
Maybe those lifeforms are
just part of their function.

00:29:26.058 --> 00:29:28.448 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:47.048 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Methinks, when you're
feeling low and insignificant,

00:29:47.048 --> 00:29:49.294 align:middle line:10%
how amazing and
unlikely is your birth.

00:29:49.294 --> 00:29:53.006 align:middle line:84%
And as , Monty Python says,
let's hope there's intelligent

00:29:53.006 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:84%
life somewhere out in space,
cause it's bugger all down here

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:06.576 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:10.036 align:middle line:84%
>>Mark and I were taking
photos and videos on the beach.

00:30:10.036 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I was wearing this red
dress with all these circles

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.519 align:middle line:90%
and the symbols all over it.

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked at the
photographs afterwards,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
there was all these strange,
greenish, yellow shapes

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%
around my body.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.605 align:middle line:84%
And it was so strange cause
there was nothing on the beach.

00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Just like it is now.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Mark was shooting with a
still camera at the same time,

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and there were no
filters or attachments.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.435 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at the
images the next day.

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I was wearing this red dress.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Then Mark looked at the
circles and the symbols

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.924 align:middle line:84%
on my red dress, and then
at the images in the photos

00:31:07.924 --> 00:31:10.532 align:middle line:84%
with all these
circles around me.

00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:12.345 align:middle line:84%
And we realized they
were so similar.

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:22.783 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:24.158 align:middle line:84%
So then, he had
this inspiration.

00:31:24.158 --> 00:31:29.432 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.432 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Mark told me about
the other shoots

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:10%
where these unusual
small objects

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.220 align:middle line:10%
to be photographed that were
very similar to the movements

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:10%
of the people.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Mark had this idea
of me wearing a shirt

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.135 align:middle line:84%
with distinct different
shapes, and to shoot again

00:31:42.135 --> 00:31:43.812 align:middle line:84%
to see if shapes
like on the shirt

00:31:43.812 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
might appear in the photos.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We used bright, fluorescent
colors for shapes

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.978 align:middle line:84%
as the light energy seemed
to be attracted by them.

00:31:52.978 --> 00:31:55.186 align:middle line:84%
Mark drew this triangle
shape with the circle inside.

00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:59.522 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had the idea of two
more connected triangles.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:11.225 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:12.147 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:32:12.147 --> 00:32:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Well I followed Mark up
the trail to the beach.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped here and pointed
his camera into the forest,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and took a couple of pictures.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, there's
no lights or anything.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:10%
When we looked at
the photos later,

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:10%
there was this amazing
image of this thing being

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.712 align:middle line:10%
with eyes, arms, torso, legs.

00:32:32.712 --> 00:32:33.740 align:middle line:10%
And these triangles.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
For the beach shoot,
I wore the shirt

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.090 align:middle line:84%
with the triangles
painted on it.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The filming didn't start too
well because I actually lost

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%
the apple on the first throw.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.706 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't great,
because we had no more apples.

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It was really blowy and stormy,
and without any apple to throw,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.885 align:middle line:90%
we could've easily given up.

00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:90%
But I persevered.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.716 align:middle line:90%
And I found a rock instead.

00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:10%
It paid off hugely as some
of the most amazing captures

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:10%
on this journey were
about to happen.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:84%
The first video
sequence captured

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.276 align:middle line:84%
a light that moved around
me at super velocity

00:33:16.276 --> 00:33:17.168 align:middle line:90%
in an arc trajectory.

00:33:17.168 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.242 align:middle line:84%
There were other similar
lights captured too.

00:33:28.242 --> 00:33:31.958 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:10%
And when we looked at the
shots, this huge, enormous globe

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.115 align:middle line:10%
of light interconnected
triangles,

00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:10%
and circles appeared in the
most beautiful shapes and forms

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:10%
and I don't see and I've
never seen anything like it

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.326 align:middle line:10%
in my life.

00:33:45.326 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's just so beautiful.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.566 align:middle line:84%
The colors in the
fluorescent lifeform

00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:53.852 align:middle line:84%
were just the same as what
we painted on the shirt.

00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
The video that was shot at the
same time as the still photos

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:84%
showed these two forms that
appeared inches away from me.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
One looked to me like
an angel with wings,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and the other one was
an inverted triangle

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.049 align:middle line:84%
with multiple
spheres inside of it.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:84%
They both had
distinctive shapes,

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and were both evanescent.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Vanishing, and with two what
may be the same all similar

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
forms reappearing out of nothing
a fraction of a second later.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.159 align:middle line:84%
My feelings about
this is that when

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:84%
you hold a thought or
an object in your mind,

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:30.322 align:middle line:84%
these energies can
read your mind.

00:34:30.322 --> 00:34:33.504 align:middle line:84%
And because they're friendly
and very intelligent,

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and because we wanted to
have a reflection of what

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:84%
was on the t-shirt, that's
exactly what happened.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.807 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.807 --> 00:34:43.619 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they
are a part of God,

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:46.332 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
communicate with them,

00:34:46.332 --> 00:34:49.864 align:middle line:90%
but on a telepathic level.

00:34:49.864 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they are
friendly, and very very

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.445 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really understand
a lot about them as yet.

00:34:57.445 --> 00:35:00.265 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to
learn more about them.

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:03.981 align:middle line:84%
And they can help us
hugely in the future.

00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:10%
>>On a surf ship to Burleigh
Heads on Australia's Gold

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Coast, an hour north
of Byron in 2007,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.610 align:middle line:10%
while walking through the
forest above the surf,

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:10%
I accidentally captured a
bluish purplish light form.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:10%
Could it be possible
that Burleigh Heads,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:10%
like Byron Bay and
Hessdalen in Norway,

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.119 align:middle line:10%
was also a haven for mysterious
unexplained light phenomena?

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Burleigh Heads is where I set
up my first chiropractic clinic

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:84%
after graduating from
chiropractic college in the US.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the palm tree
lined white sand beaches

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of Cocoa Beach, Florida,
just south of Cape Canaveral

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
where the first space
shuttle blasted off in 1981.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I surfed the same Cocoa Beach
surf breaks as the modern day

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:90%
surfing's goodwill ambassador.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And winningest ever pro
surfer, Kelly Slater,

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
who like me, went to
Cocoa Beach High School.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Although Florida surf
can be good at times,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.330 align:middle line:84%
surfing the crystal
tubing caverns,

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Burleigh is renowned
for worldwide,

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.290 align:middle line:84%
it was like a surfing
nirvana for me.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I
wasn't floating along

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.752 align:middle line:84%
those winding tunnels on my
6' 6" channel bottom board,

00:36:19.752 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I was taking photos
from the water or land.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of
freelance photography

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:84%
for different magazines
and publications.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.390 align:middle line:84%
One of my Burleigh shots made
it as a double page spread

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.602 align:middle line:90%
on Surfer Magazine.

00:36:31.602 --> 00:36:34.087 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of being
enveloped by a tubular energy

00:36:34.087 --> 00:36:36.876 align:middle line:84%
vortex at Burleigh would
create a euphoric out

00:36:36.876 --> 00:36:40.806 align:middle line:84%
of body sensation that
would stay with me for days.

00:36:40.806 --> 00:36:42.722 align:middle line:84%
It could give you something
more than physical

00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
happening when a surfer
rides inside the hollows

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of a breaking wave.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.125 align:middle line:84%
When the wind is offshore,
and the swell was lined up

00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to the horizon,
the random energy,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:84%
which is so often what we see in
the ocean, has become in phase,

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.345 align:middle line:90%
it's in line like a laser.

00:36:58.345 --> 00:37:00.407 align:middle line:10%
And so you have these
powerful bands of energy.

00:37:00.407 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:10%
If you bounce light through
a chamber back and forth

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:10%
many, many times, that light
becomes coherent light.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:10%
It becomes in phase, like
waves lining up on a beach

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.023 align:middle line:10%
to the horizon.

00:37:12.023 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:10%
And you create of course
this very powerful energy,

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:10%
this laser, which can
do incredible things.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:84%
If one splits that laser beam
into two, an elimination beam

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and a reference beam,
the interference pattern

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:84%
created when the
two beams intersect

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
creates a pattern which is
imprinted on a recording

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:90%
medium, creating a hologram.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:84%
gram You take a
tiny little piece

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of that holographic image,
and you expand it up

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and it has the same
information as the original.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The interference pattern,
it's like an encoded version

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of the original scene
that one is photographing.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And this encoded version
requires a key to unlock it.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And that key is the
original light source.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:90%
What is reality, really?

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.400 align:middle line:10%
The holistic viewpoint
is that the human

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:10%
itself is holographic and
has vital energy centers

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.230 align:middle line:10%
known as the chakras,
vortices of energy

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:10%
from which the vital inner
essence is expressed through.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And that these holographic
forces can be enhanced

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:10%
or dampened in different ways,
especially through technology

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:10%
that we use.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:10%
I like to think of these super
high velocity light energy

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:10%
forms that I and others
are capturing on film

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.510 align:middle line:10%
has surface of the ether.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:39:24.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:10%
My Burleigh experiences
led to my lifelong focus

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:10%
on the study of what's
known as subtle energies,

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:10%
described by Dr. William
Tiller of Stanford University

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.210 align:middle line:10%
as all those energies
existing in the universe

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.660 align:middle line:10%
beyond the four known to
and accepted by present day

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.972 align:middle line:10%
science.

00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I love the Burleigh
rainforest, and would often

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:84%
go for runs under the
tall green canopy out

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of the hot Queensland
sun with my camera,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.050 align:middle line:84%
taking photos of forest
animals and the surf

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
from above the headland.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I could have ever
imagined that 20 years later, I

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:84%
would be in the same
forest on a very

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:84%
different photographic
journey with a camera that

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:03.070 align:middle line:84%
had a digital sensor
instead of film.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
the Sigma DP2 camera,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.890 align:middle line:84%
a unique three layered
silicone foveon sensor,

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
similar to the three layer
emulsion used in film cameras,

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.070 align:middle line:84%
providing digital images
free of digital artifacts,

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and with very high detail
and color rendition,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.695 align:middle line:90%
similar to 35 mil slide film.

00:40:22.695 --> 00:40:25.612 align:middle line:84%
All physical life on Earth as
we know it is carbon based,

00:40:25.612 --> 00:40:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and it has properties
that scientists associate

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.306 align:middle line:90%
with the element carbon.

00:40:31.306 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have been theorizing
about extraterrestrial life

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:84%
being non carbon based with
very different traits to what we

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.745 align:middle line:90%
normally think of as life.

00:40:38.745 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:84%
In 2007, the US National
Research Council

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.040 align:middle line:84%
published a paper recommending
that scientists search

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.340 align:middle line:90%
for non carbon based life forms.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:84%
The report emphasized
that no discovery

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
we can make in our exploration
of the solar system

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.750 align:middle line:84%
would have greater impact
on our view of our position

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos or be more
inspiring than the discovery

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.681 align:middle line:90%
of an alien life form.

00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:08.353 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.353 --> 00:41:10.936 align:middle line:84%
We may have come across a first
this morning here in Burleigh.

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:14.110 align:middle line:84%
It's full daylight, about
8:00 in the morning.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:20.916 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:23.421 align:middle line:90%
It's almost dark in light.

00:41:23.421 --> 00:41:25.796 align:middle line:84%
That's when I've been capturing
images of the life forms.

00:41:25.796 --> 00:41:28.455 align:middle line:10%
But this morning, I think
I may captured a life

00:41:28.455 --> 00:41:31.245 align:middle line:10%
form in full daylight.

00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:32.045 align:middle line:10%
Real first.

00:41:32.045 --> 00:41:40.148 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.148 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Right above that rock there.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I clambered up.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.688 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to do again now.

00:41:44.688 --> 00:41:47.560 align:middle line:90%


00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Clamber up here with the
camera and take the same shot

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:90%
with the same angle.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:59.200 align:middle line:10%
And see if there's
anything luminous that's

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.002 align:middle line:10%
visible that could explain
what we just captured here.

00:42:02.002 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:10%
The Burleigh light forms
captured on video and still,

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:10%
and on occasion, seen
with the naked eye

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:10%
definitely had a
character of their own

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.850 align:middle line:10%
with distinct
coloration and form.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:10%
To me, they seem bolder
than the Byron lights,

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.360 align:middle line:10%
appearing not for
just a brief flash,

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.638 align:middle line:10%
but as continuous streaks.

00:42:49.638 --> 00:42:53.090 align:middle line:10%
Like this one, I photographed
at night with an LED torch

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:10%
in front of himself very
confident Burleigh possum.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And in this full
daylight Burleigh capture

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.195 align:middle line:84%
in the bowl of an enormous
and ancient fig tree,

00:43:06.195 --> 00:43:08.650 align:middle line:84%
the light forms
weren't even flashing

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
at high velocity in and out
of the visible spectrum.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They were just sitting
there without moving

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.290 align:middle line:84%
as I photographed them
on video and still.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Stills were taken with the
Sigma DP2 set to burst capture

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:20.940 align:middle line:90%
at two frames a second.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So no flash could be
used, confirming again

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that these light forms
were emanating light.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.110 align:middle line:10%
Examining the different
photos and video

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:10%
stills of the Burleigh
light phenomenon

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:10%
showed very similar
fuchsia, pink,

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.980 align:middle line:10%
and teal blue green
colorations, as well as

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.265 align:middle line:10%
elongated flattened shapes.

00:43:39.265 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:10%
The images seemed to
show the same object

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.580 align:middle line:10%
or family of objects.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Could these light forms really
represent a newly discovered

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:84%
form of life, in
this stage anyway?

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:84%
One only theorized
by modern science?

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I wanted further confirmation of
the intelligent plasma theory.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I attended a packed
lecture by researcher Pane

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Andov in early 2011,
I asked him if he

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.276 align:middle line:84%
would be willing to give his
evaluation of the new material.

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Pane, born in Macedonia,
is an ex computer scientist

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:84%
who has become
internationally recognized

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.810 align:middle line:84%
for his work in the field
of esoteric science.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.890 align:middle line:84%
He is in demand as a speaker
at international conferences.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And his lectures on subjects
ranging from ancient prehistory

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, and
extraterrestrial Earth

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.450 align:middle line:84%
influences, to remote viewing,
telepathy and meditation

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
have intrigued and informed
thousands worldwide.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.460 align:middle line:10%
I met with Pane Andov
on the Gold Coast one

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.884 align:middle line:10%
late afternoon in early 2011
only minutes from where I

00:44:36.884 --> 00:44:38.175 align:middle line:10%
had filmed the Burleigh lights.

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
That you also have been
seeing and photographing

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:90%
unexplained light phenomenon.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, that's correct.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.775 align:middle line:10%
Look, you have
impressive footage there.

00:44:56.775 --> 00:45:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And what we're looking
at is a life form.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:05.402 align:middle line:10%
And it's producing
light on its own.

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
As you can see,
sometimes they're

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.675 align:middle line:84%
flashing sometimes
just static light.

00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time
they're moving very fast.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they can move
in the right angles.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:23.146 align:middle line:84%
You can see them in a split
of a second and they're gone.

00:45:23.146 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:84%
They can move inside the
rock and could get out

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.451 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:45:29.451 --> 00:45:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we even
record them how

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:90%
they are moving through walls--

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Through walls?

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>And apartments, buildings.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:10%
They are part of-- how should I
say-- hidden spectrum of life.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:47.246 align:middle line:10%
Which is existing partly
physically, partly etherically.

00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, ancient
cultures had names

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:54.690 align:middle line:84%
for other dimensional life,
such as fairies, angels, pixies,

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:90%
divas.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.450 align:middle line:10%
When you say a
biological organism,

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:10%
would you say that it's falling
into this type of category?

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, definitely.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's obvious
that inside the forests,

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:84%
there are plenty
of life that is not

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.846 align:middle line:84%
recognizable from us-- for us,
because we have limitations.

00:46:11.846 --> 00:46:13.497 align:middle line:90%
Five senses limitation.

00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:90%
We cannot perceive it, you know?

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in the blink
of an eye or something

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:17.875 align:middle line:90%
like that, you know?

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's very simple.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.445 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the sky,
there's nothing there.

00:46:22.445 --> 00:46:26.530 align:middle line:84%
No object, no extraterrestrial
activity, no rods activity,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:90%
if you do.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you introduced
technology,

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
you put infrared
cameras and night vision

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and similar technologies.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And you would start
to realize, you

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.469 align:middle line:84%
start to see
activities that are not

00:46:39.469 --> 00:46:41.500 align:middle line:90%
visible on the visible spectrum.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a book called
"The Cosmic Pulse of Life."

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It was written by a
man, Trevor Constable,

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:90%
an American researcher.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.242 align:middle line:84%
>>And I respect his
work very, very much.

00:46:49.242 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:10%
>>Saying exactly
what you're saying,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.660 align:middle line:10%
is that the UFO is not something
that necessarily just appears

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.780 align:middle line:10%
in our physical world
as an unusual object.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.593 align:middle line:84%
It's more that
something, as you just

00:47:01.593 --> 00:47:04.704 align:middle line:84%
described that's interacting
with us all the time.

00:47:04.704 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just that most of the
time, we can't pick it up

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.670 align:middle line:90%
with our senses.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>I will tell you just this,
when they launch exit space

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.044 align:middle line:84%
shuttles, they installed
very sensitive equipments.

00:47:13.044 --> 00:47:14.952 align:middle line:90%
>>We see two rings right there.

00:47:14.952 --> 00:47:17.814 align:middle line:10%
They're the ones we kinda
had the late tally ho on.

00:47:17.814 --> 00:47:19.404 align:middle line:10%
The one down at the
bottom was the one

00:47:19.404 --> 00:47:19.730 align:middle line:10%
we were able to pick up.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>>Equipment was able to pick
up the infrared spectra.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:10%
>>We do have an
unidentified flying object.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:31.773 align:middle line:90%


00:47:31.773 --> 00:47:34.723 align:middle line:10%
>>And when the infrared
spectra was running,

00:47:34.723 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:10%
scan actually in infrared they
found those huge bolt of light

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.220 align:middle line:10%
moving in front of the camera.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.900 align:middle line:10%
And there was nothing
visible from the window,

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:10%
the visible spectrum.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But those living creatures
that he's describing actually,

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they're real, and they're just
living in different dimension.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.175 align:middle line:10%
They penetrate, they
materialize from time to time.

00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:08.630 align:middle line:10%
They're visible here.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.111 align:middle line:10%
But most of the time, they
are on different dimension,

00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:12.069 align:middle line:10%
on different frequency.

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.872 align:middle line:84%
>>In our culture, such
concepts are usually

00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.218 align:middle line:90%
considered as science fiction.

00:48:25.218 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>And my perspective
is that we are actually

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:90%
infinite consciousness.

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.912 align:middle line:84%
And that infinite
consciousness escape

00:48:31.912 --> 00:48:34.546 align:middle line:84%
will have moved to
dimensional presence.

00:48:34.546 --> 00:48:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So, not just that escape will
move to dimensional present,

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:42.500 align:middle line:84%
but also possesses different
subtle bodies, if you will,

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that have different density and
different speed of vibration.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Aerial though subtle
bodies actually

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:51.750 align:middle line:84%
measures the density and
the speed of vibration

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.285 align:middle line:90%
of every dimension.

00:48:53.285 --> 00:48:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So when a person experience
out of the body experience

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:84%
or near-death experience, his
or her senses actually increase.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.244 align:middle line:84%
And they're able
to see things that

00:49:06.244 --> 00:49:07.910 align:middle line:84%
are on the invisible
spectrum, you know?

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
see those phenomenas

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:90%
that you have recorded, right?

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And you start to see
extraterrestrial presence there

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and you start to see
complete different life

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.790 align:middle line:90%
forms if you will, right?

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So, even when we go
to sleep every night,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.920 align:middle line:84%
because without food,
without liquid, we

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.180 align:middle line:84%
can sustain for a while,
let's say 15 to 20 days.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But without sleep, we are
dead actually physically,

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.300 align:middle line:84%
biologically after
three or four days,

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.620 align:middle line:84%
because we need the energy
that our consciousness actually

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:84%
generating through us, so
body won't actually-- we

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.880 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
the sleeping time.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.440 align:middle line:84%
When that is on the run, we're
already in that dimension

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.734 align:middle line:84%
where all those phenomena
that you are speaking about

00:49:50.734 --> 00:49:51.946 align:middle line:90%
are happening.

00:49:51.946 --> 00:49:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it in
case you are trained

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to wake up inside the dream.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.106 align:middle line:84%
Break the dream
program, if you will,

00:50:00.106 --> 00:50:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and gain complete control
of the astral body.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Soon after my talk with
Pane, on March 11, 2011,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:24.300 align:middle line:84%
a 9.0 earthquake struck the
Northeast coast of Japan.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The massive earthquake
triggered a tsunami which

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.471 align:middle line:90%
caused widespread devastation.

00:50:29.471 --> 00:50:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The earthquake and
tsunami shut down

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:34.496 align:middle line:84%
five nuclear reactors
at Fukushima,

00:50:34.496 --> 00:50:36.810 align:middle line:84%
leaving nuclear
fuel rods exposed.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:40.086 align:middle line:10%
>>Eight hours away from a
Chernobyl type scenario.

00:50:40.086 --> 00:50:44.054 align:middle line:84%
Temperatures in the reactors
are said to be soaring.

00:50:44.054 --> 00:50:46.490 align:middle line:10%
>>Footage of the tsunami
showed light spheres

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:10%
moving at high velocity,
similar to the videos captured

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.538 align:middle line:10%
at Hessdalen in Norway,
and at Byron Bay.

00:50:51.538 --> 00:50:57.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:01.090 align:middle line:10%
If other dimensions do exist,
as modern physics theorizes,

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.210 align:middle line:10%
and if intelligent life is a
possibility in parallel worlds,

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:07.850 align:middle line:10%
as plasma theorists relate,
could events such as a nuclear

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:11.510 align:middle line:10%
meltdown or melt through, as
happened in Fukushima on Earth,

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.200 align:middle line:10%
affect these hidden realms
and their inhabitants?

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.370 align:middle line:10%
>>And when we're dealing
with cesium, which is also

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:19.080 align:middle line:10%
released from nuclear
reactors, we're

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.760 align:middle line:10%
talking about needing 300
years for that all to go away,

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.410 align:middle line:10%
>>And now, radioactive
isotopes are already

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:27.770 align:middle line:10%
leaking into the sea?

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>If we have to have
a radioactive release,

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.160 align:middle line:84%
the best place for
it is in the sea,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's
immediately diluted out.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:40.156 align:middle line:10%
And that offers the greatest
protection to the population.

00:51:40.156 --> 00:51:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And it will find its
way into the food chain,

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if a
growth reminder issue.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:52:03.808 align:middle line:90%

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.584 align:middle line:90%
waters off of Byron Bay.

00:52:39.584 --> 00:52:44.066 align:middle line:84%
And Australia's east coast,
March 2011 this morning.

00:52:44.066 --> 00:52:47.054 align:middle line:84%
And as always, just to be
in the ocean environment's

00:52:47.054 --> 00:52:49.544 align:middle line:90%
so inspiring and rejuvenating.

00:52:49.544 --> 00:52:54.026 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.026 --> 00:52:56.267 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
other dimensions that

00:52:56.267 --> 00:52:58.327 align:middle line:84%
exist in the ocean
environment, I

00:52:58.327 --> 00:53:00.802 align:middle line:84%
believe inhabited by beings
that we don't normally can't

00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:03.030 align:middle line:90%
see with our senses.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.436 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard that news
report that radio nucleides are

00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:08.270 align:middle line:84%
being released into
the ocean, currents

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:84%
would undoubtedly carry
these particles of radiation

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.680 align:middle line:90%
across the entire globe.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And that the half life of
caesium, one of the elements

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.840 align:middle line:90%
released, is 300 years.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.920 align:middle line:10%
The generations to come
beyond our own, which

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:10%
are going to be affected by what
has been put in the ocean here.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:43.452 align:middle line:90%


00:53:43.452 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Fine for a surfer to pass
here in the afternoon.

00:53:49.535 --> 00:53:50.951 align:middle line:84%
When I came up out
of the water, I

00:53:50.951 --> 00:53:52.820 align:middle line:84%
saw Mathilde waiting
for me on the sand.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.178 align:middle line:90%
So I went up to her and said hi.

00:53:54.178 --> 00:53:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Up ahead, I saw this object.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It was about a foot in width.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was arc shaped
It was only there

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:84%
for a second, or maybe a
flash, and then it was gone.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.784 align:middle line:90%
But I definitely saw it.

00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The lights appear
at strange times,

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.710 align:middle line:84%
like when we were
talking about them.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:13.967 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.967 --> 00:54:17.680 align:middle line:10%
It was like this arc shape
with a central darker color,

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.782 align:middle line:10%
and the outer
surface was lighter.

00:54:19.782 --> 00:54:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me of the
three dimensional images

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've captured
in this area at dusk

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:84%
by accident or by purpose, but
not actually seen with the eye.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:41.435 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.435 --> 00:54:43.560 align:middle line:84%
On the way back from the
surface, up to the vantage

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.360 align:middle line:84%
point high above Byron
where we filmed the lights

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.160 align:middle line:90%
so many times.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And I remembered, I just had it
in my mind that image of that

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.405 align:middle line:10%
three dimensional form
with the red and green oval

00:54:57.405 --> 00:54:59.367 align:middle line:10%
shapes on the side
of that curve,

00:54:59.367 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:10%
and the y shape
attached from the end.

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:04.030 align:middle line:10%
That image that intrigued
me more than any other image

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.623 align:middle line:10%
that I've ever
captured in my life.

00:55:05.623 --> 00:55:08.180 align:middle line:90%


00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.027 align:middle line:84%
Well when I looked
at this few stills

00:55:10.027 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that I took cause it was almost
dark, I only got 10 shots off.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.068 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at
one of them, there

00:55:14.068 --> 00:55:16.440 align:middle line:84%
were these two orange
joined circles.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I know the lens
blur only happens

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
when you have a bright
light source, like you're

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.540 align:middle line:90%
shooting into the sun.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost dark,
the sun had set.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.498 align:middle line:84%
So this was a really
unusual image.

00:55:26.498 --> 00:55:29.064 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked carefully
at this other shot

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:90%
that I had taken.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.696 align:middle line:90%
This one, to my right.

00:55:33.696 --> 00:55:40.642 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.642 --> 00:55:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought, at first, that
it could be an insect

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and it was small.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
looked more closely,

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I could see it had distinct
geometries in form and shape.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:52.490 align:middle line:10%
And it had the same ruby red
and emerald green oval shapes

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:10%
on the side of it, and
even a third emerald shape

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.870 align:middle line:10%
on another corner of it.

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.912 align:middle line:10%
There's no question
in my mind that it

00:56:00.912 --> 00:56:03.480 align:middle line:10%
was either the same object
of the same family of objects

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.380 align:middle line:10%
as that incredible
capture on video

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:10%
and still from the
same spot a year ago.

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:15.799 align:middle line:90%


00:56:15.799 --> 00:56:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>It doesn't resemble
at all a normal plasma

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.720 align:middle line:90%
like a star would be.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.720 align:middle line:84%
The light distribution
is very steep.

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.782 align:middle line:84%
And it is typical of a uniformly
illuminated solid body.

00:56:28.782 --> 00:56:33.336 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.336 --> 00:56:36.085 align:middle line:84%
>>To me, it looks like a
key to some magical kingdom,

00:56:36.085 --> 00:56:38.560 align:middle line:84%
or to unlocking the
secrets of a lost science.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.138 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps tapping into the
ether, the bioresin energy.

00:56:42.138 --> 00:56:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>>Investigated in the modern
day as zero point and Vril.

00:56:46.210 --> 00:57:12.388 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Vril, based on the 19th century
novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton,

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.220 align:middle line:10%
described as the
all-prevailing latent

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.190 align:middle line:10%
energy utilized by the
pre-Deluvian Atlantian

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.090 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.210 align:middle line:10%
And that the understanding
of these forms

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.110 align:middle line:10%
could, as Dr. Teodorani and
the other Hessdalen scientists

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.702 align:middle line:10%
relate, bring freedom from
dependence on fossil fuel,

00:57:31.702 --> 00:57:35.200 align:middle line:10%
as well as from worldwide
nuclear cataclysm.

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.853 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps just
as more imporantly,

00:57:37.853 --> 00:57:40.040 align:middle line:10%
a way to solve an
interaction with what

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.810 align:middle line:10%
may be intelligence from outside
of our dimensional sphere.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Could trigger the quantum
consciousness jump,

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:51.050 align:middle line:84%
ushering in a new era if
the truly Eutopian vision.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:58:01.751 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:03.630 align:middle line:10%
>>If we would be
able to control it,

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:06.290 align:middle line:10%
then it would be very
fascinating and very nice.
