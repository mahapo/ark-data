It's not because it's trivial.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.659 align:middle line:84%
It's because the implications

elaborate descriptions of
"vimana" or "flying craft."

These texts are
thousands of years old.

It is also captured
in our ancestors' art,

as if it was plainly obvious

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
that ET vehicles
appeared in ancient skies.

It is a forgone conclusion
by most broad-minded people

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are not alone
in this universe.

The question is,
how close are they?

HODGES: And we all looked up
at once.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
an intelligence told us,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, look over here.
We're here."

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%

almost directly overhead.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I saw these things,
and I ran inside

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and got my brothers and sister.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It actually lifted up,
and it could actually turn.

I wasn't one who believed
that UFO's might exist,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
I was satisfied they exist.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
CARTER: They estimated
100 yards from the left wing

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
was this 100-foot disc.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the astronauts

that even if less than 1%
is true,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%

that the number of all minds
in the universe is one,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
this type of contact,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
a human could potentially access
that single inner consciousness

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:90%
through intense meditation

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and then visualize his location

down through the Milky Way

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to wherever he sits
under the stars.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
In theory, then,
any extraterrestrial passing by

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
would be able
to hear the broadcast

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:90%
and know exactly where to go

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:90%
if they choose to do so.

and refining them,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
then you can make contact
more quickly, more easily,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and be more of a asset
to the group.

I am Dr. Greer's

I also am their photographer.

AUMAN: Many of the craft
that are coming in

are trans dimensional

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and, the way I understand it,
not visible to the human eye,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's where this new
technology - the night vision -

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that's where that's
coming into play.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: With the advent of new
technology that's out there,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
it becomes easier and easier
for us to capture these beings

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and these celestial objects
on film.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
After you do the night vision,
it has a green hue, of course,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and after a while when you
get back to real life,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking,
"Why isn't everything green?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:90%
This can't be reality."

that happened

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is that I had about
40-50 people:

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:90%
"Let's go out on the beach."

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have
good cameras then,

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%

of how exciting it was

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:90%
having all these people,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%

three and then four ET craft

that are amplified
by our meditation.

GREER: Oh, here comes
a military plane. Right here.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a very fast military-

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It turned right to it, yeah.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
KEHOE: Literally,
my heart literally sunk

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
when the jet, you know,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
got to where the craft
had to phase out.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, to feel
all that love build

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and then to feel
that jet coming in

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was, like,
on a heart level,

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:90%
my heart literally sunk

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
when the jet crossed the path
where it had to be gone.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
KALEKA: So on the camera
that's what you got?

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You got, like,
this light traveling,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
'cause you can see
it's not like a satellite

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:90%
where it's got, like, a path.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's got like a, you know,
like a movement.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and then it's gone.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
When I was seventeen,
I injured myself.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It got so infected,
and at the time -

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was very poor and
I didn't have any healthcare,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I just laid there, and I got
sicker and sicker and sicker,

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and I had a near-death
experience.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I found myself
out in deep space,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was this experience
of complete oneness

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:90%
with the cosmos.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Not just with Earth
and life on Earth,

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:84%
but with the stars
and the infinity of creation.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It certainly altered the course
of what I would end up doing

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:84%
because I then
learned meditation.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually became very aware
of the power of the mind.

NARRATOR: This experience helped
guide the direction of his life.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Though Greer went on
to earn a medical degree

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and raise a family,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
he continued to study
consciousness and contact.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Decades later, it seems he would
be the doctor called upon first

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to examine
the very unusual body.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
GREER: This came to us
in the last couple of years,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and there is a man who runs
an institute in another country

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:90%
that I cannot talk about.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But he came into possession
of a little creature.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It is humanoid.
It does not look human.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:90%
We have acquired an EBE

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
- an extraterrestrial
biological entity.

We're flying over
to Europe soon

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to take some tissue samples
and do some DNA testing.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
GREER: This was found
in the Atacama Desert.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how it came about.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Here is a great view of the face
and cheekbone - very complex.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, there is a fracture here,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and behind this right ear
is caved in,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's how this ET being
was killed.

SMITH: We have the best
scientists in the US,

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
from Stanford, that are going to
be doing the testing itself

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
to see what this really is

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and also to rule out
what it's not.

NOLAN: The initial reaction
that I had is the same reaction

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that many of my colleagues
here at Stanford

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere have had,
when I've shown them is

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:90%
"Wow! What is this?"

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The question is important enough
in at least two ways.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:90%
The primary reason is that

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of claims
about specimens

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:90%
and claims about aliens.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's a lot of
ridicule associated with that,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:84%
so one of the best things
that we should be doing

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is bringing the best
scientific techniques to bare.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The techniques are available.
The techniques are cheap.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The answers are nearly absolute,
so let's do it.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:90%
[NOLAN TALKING TO GREER]

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
In setting up for this,
I'm going to be giving Steve

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
not only the tubes
that this should be going into,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also going to be sending
across the microscope

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that I feel they should be using
to do the analysis with.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Before we even get started
with some of the analysis,

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to be
important to rule out

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
some of the obvious critiques
that could come up,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and one of those critiques
is that this is

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:90%
a syndrome or a mutation;

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:90%
this is a bone dysplasia.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, here at Stanford,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
we happen to have literally
the world's expert

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
- the man who wrote the book on
bone dysplasias and syndromes -

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman by the name
of Dr. Ralph Lachman,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
who has kindly agreed
to look at the specimen,

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:84%
both pictures as well as
the CT scans and the X-rays,

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
to help determine whether or not

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
it's anything
that he's ever seen before.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that a dozen
or even 15 years ago,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
answering the question
of "What is this?"

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
would really not have been
possible because

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of technologies
were not available

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:90%
as are available today.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But really
the DNA tells the story,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and because we have
the computational techniques-

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to determine
in very sure order

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:90%
whether in fact this is human.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So this will be basically
an absolute level of proof

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
as to what this actually is.

proving that UFOs exist.

behind how they're getting here.

What scientists need to do
and normal people need to do

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:84%
is they need to look at

decide that- oh, my gosh-

You're interacting
with a charged matrix,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.750 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR:
New energy scientists today

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
are attempting to find new ways
to define the relationship

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:90%
between electricity, gravity,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.890 align:middle line:90%
magnetism, and propulsion.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:90%
But as history has shown,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
change does not always
come easy.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:90%
MURAD: It's like Newton.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:90%
"Why's that apple falling?"

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever asked
that question before

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:84%
or even tried to come up
with an answer,

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and Newton comes up
with something called

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Newton bucket
or Newton's problem.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The only guy that solves it
300 years later is Einstein,

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:84%
so, you know,
how smart can we be?

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:90%
[GRUNTS]

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:84%
If you look at everything normal
within the conventional wisdom,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to learn
anything new.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:90%
My name's Morgan Boardman.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I am the chief financial officer
of Morningstar Applied Physics.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:84%
My business partners
are Paul Murad

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
and Dr. John Brandenburg.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing,
like I said earlier,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
is we're using a magnetic field
that's rotating about the axis

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
with the hope of generating
a magnetic vortex.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:84%
In essence,
we are trying to start

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
a civilian advanced research
projects agency.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Ok. Alright, so basically
we have four options.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Option one is
a retarded potential.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Option two is
a lagging image, right?

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Option three is pointing vector
as a motive for propulsion.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That may be
what's happening, right?

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually taking
angular momentum

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and changing it into linear
momentum

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
if it's working the way
we want it to, right?

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Ok. And then the fourth one is

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that we are somehow
either generating

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and/or absorbing gravity waves.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:90%
-You got it.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
MURAD: Do we accept
Einstein's viewpoint

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that thou shall not go faster
than the speed of light?

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:90%
If you look at a black hole,

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
the comment is that gravity is
so strong that nothing leaves,

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
but it does have something
that leaves a black hole,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and that is gravity.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So does that imply
that gravity

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
moves faster than
the speed of light?

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Could be.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Gravity is another
one of those seemingly

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:90%
self-evident forces

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that has raised
a number of questions:

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:90%
How does it really work?

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
How can we use it
to our advantage?

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1920s,
T. Townsend Brown discovered

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that electric charge and
gravitational mass are coupled,

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and that by building devices

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that harness
these interactive forces,

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
we could create
advanced propulsion.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
At about the same time,
Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
won the Nobel prize in physics,
but both refused it.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was at the end of
a long career of inventing.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He had advanced technology
in the fields of X-ray,

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
radio waves,
internal combustion,

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
atmospheric electricity.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:84%
When everything
was said and done,

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:90%
he had earned 112 US patents.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.410 align:middle line:84%
He proved that electricity can
travel wirelessly in the air

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately died penniless.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:84%
However, his work
did influence many others,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
most notably Lester Hendershot
and Dr. T. Henry Moray.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Hendershot invented
a magnetronic generator

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
to energize an impossible
flight, if fueled by gas,

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that took Charles Lindberg
and the Spirit of St. Louis

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
from New York to Paris.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. T. Henry Moray
developed the Moray Valve,

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:84%
a device for extracting radiant
energy from the zero point field

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrated this device
hundreds of times

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
and had dozens
of signed affidavits

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:90%
supporting his science.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in the end, even these
two notable scientists

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:90%
were ignored and bullied.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moray's device
was hammered down

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and broken into pieces
by a competitor,

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and before he could
finish reconstruction,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:84%
he passed away
of natural causes.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:84%
Hendershot fled to Mexico
to continue work

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
but was found dead
at 61 years of age,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:90%
attributed to suicide.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of skullduggery

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:90%
that happened there.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think T. Henry Moray
ever got a decent chance

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:90%
to ever do anything with that.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely no question
that T. Henry Moray

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
had a system that produced
about 50 kilowatts

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:90%
out of a 55-pound box.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The conventional
electrodynamics model

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:90%
does not allow this to happen.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it doesn't allow you

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to extract excess energy
from the vacuum

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and use that to power your load.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It costs just as much to restore
it as what's used to destroy it,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so we've got to put in more than
we can ever get out in a load

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:90%
with such a squirrely circuit,

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only circuit
we've used in power systems

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:90%
since day one.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.350 align:middle line:90%
We're still building them.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We're still making power systems
that deliberately kill them

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:84%
so we pay the power company
to have a giant wrestling match

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:90%
inside this generator and lose.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
VALONE: In the 1950s, there were
some very provocative articles

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:90%
saying that electrogravitics

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is the best thing
since sliced bread,"

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
how all the aviation companies

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are now backing
electrogravitics.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
They're all doing
experiments on it.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, within a couple of years,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:90%
there was no news at all.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Once they figured out
that they could really

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:90%
control gravity,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:90%
1954, it all went black.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the boys
in the black projects

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:90%
have solved that problem?

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Because it sure sounds like it

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:84%
from what the witnesses
have told me.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't know.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, but I can't even
think about it.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I've seen so many things
in my life,

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:90%
it's just hard to say.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
REPORTER: A local inventor has
discovered a way, hear this,

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:90%
to use water to run your car!

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
What Stan shared with me
was interesting.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:84%
In order to run this engine
off of water,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
we've also had to learn
the ability to adjust

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.880 align:middle line:84%
the burn rate of hydrogen
to coequal the fossil fuels.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:90%
So he applies for a patent,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and then he gets a call from,
actually a visitation,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
by two guys from the Pentagon.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
REPORTER: The Pentagon flew a
Lieutenant Colonel in last week

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to look at Meyer's invention.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:84%
There's talk
of possibly using it

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in the Star Wars
defense program

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and to run army tanks.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But he asked that
this become public patent

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.610 align:middle line:84%
so that civilians
could benefit from it,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and he indicated
that if we don't do that,

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:90%
overseas people will.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.780 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: In 1996,
Meyer was sued by his investors,

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
who claimed the device
was not revolutionary,

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
despite verification
of the unique

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:90%
voltage intensifier circuit

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.120 align:middle line:90%
by the US patent office.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Meyer was brought to trial,

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but key evidence
was not allowed.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
His oral testimony
was not even recorded,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
due to an audio recorder
malfunction,

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and the judge recessed early
for vacation.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Later, Meyer made an appeal
that was denied.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:90%
He was found guilty of fraud

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and ordered to repay
his investors,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
putting an immediate dent on the
idea of funding new technology.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:90%
On March 20th, 1998,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Stanley joined his brother
and two NATO officials

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
for a dinner meeting.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Stan took a sip
of cranberry juice.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:84%
He grabbed his neck,
ran out of the restaurant,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and fell to the ground
saying, "They poisoned me!"

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:84%
He fell down after eating
at a restaurant nearby

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:90%
where he lived.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Fell down in the parking lot
and said, "I've been poisoned!"

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and collapsed.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's on the police report?
-Yeah.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The police report
confirms his words.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The cause of death
was written to be an aneurism.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Though he left behind
just enough materials

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
for others to piece together
his process,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
the full secrets of his device
died with him.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So, from this

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I began to do more work
with the administration -

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:84%
various people,
friends of the president,

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.680 align:middle line:90%
the Rockefeller family.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Laurance was the white hat
in that crowd

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:84%
who wanted us to bring
this information out.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Actually hosted us at the
Rockefeller ranch in the Tetons.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And one night he pulled me out
on the deck, and he said,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.650 align:middle line:84%
"Well, you know, we really
need you to do this."

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Laurance,
you're old, you're rich,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and you're a Rockefeller.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you want me to do?
I'm just a country doctor

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.160 align:middle line:84%
banging around in an ER
in North Carolina."

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.990 align:middle line:84%
He says, "No, no.
We want you to do this."

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I went, "Okay."
So I'm the throw-away guy.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm the guy you can throw away
'cause my life doesn't matter.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:84%
KING: We are back
in Rachel, Nevada,

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.750 align:middle line:84%
with our first two
distinguished guests.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer is
a North Carolina doctor.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:84%
He does a lot more
than watch the skies.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:90%
He fires off messages,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and he says that someone
or something is responding.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer is looking for close
encounters of the fifth kind.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
What, at this minute,
do you believe?

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Our assessment,
at this point,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there is at least one
extraterrestrial civilization,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
which has managed
to make its way

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:90%
to our corner of the universe,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and #2: that there's
no evidence at all

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that they have hostile
intentions towards this planet,

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and #3: that the priority,
at this point,

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.750 align:middle line:84%
must be trying to establish
some sort of a liaison to them,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:84%
some sort of a diplomatic
liaison to them,

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's
what we're working on.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Officer "X",
a high-ranking military veteran,

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:90%
joined forces with Dr. Greer

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to use his military
and government influence

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to gain access
to high-level officials.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer did indeed
mount an initiative

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and did go to Washington.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Did speak with high-level
government people.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I attended
and helped him with that.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
We briefed certain members
of Congress,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.700 align:middle line:90%
some of their staff,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.780 align:middle line:84%
some of the people
from the White House.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:84%
We talked with people
in the Pentagon.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
It led me to the belief

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:84%
that people
in high-level government

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.210 align:middle line:84%
have very, very little, if any
information - valid information.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.090 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: One of the most
important of all the meetings

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:84%
was with CIA Director
R. James Woolsey.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Here I fly up
to Washington.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
The cover story was
a dinner party.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:05.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I found
was that this CIA director

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:84%
wasn't lying
when he communicated to us

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that he had not had access
to these projects.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:90%
He was shaken to his core.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
We met for, not twenty minutes,
almost three hours,

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and by the end of it,
I handed him-

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:90%
my hands were shaking-

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I handed him this document,

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and it was a position paper
recommending executive orders

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:27.340 align:middle line:84%
in the things
the Clinton administration

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and he needed to do
to get control of this mess.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it,
and he looked at me.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Yes."

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:84%
He says,
"But how do we disclose

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that which we have
no access to?"

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I almost wept.
I went, "What?!"

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Dr. Greer
approached many DC officials

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
in an attempt to gain
an audience.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
who took him seriously

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.870 align:middle line:84%
was former CIA Director
Bill Colby.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.540 align:middle line:84%
COLBY: True,
if there's truth in it,

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.540 align:middle line:84%
there can be a danger
in that situation.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.170 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that happen
in other cases.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You have to consider
the possibility

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.170 align:middle line:90%
of some danger to,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
not only your reputation,
but to your person.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean there are-

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:84%
People do react rather violently
to some kinds of charges,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:90%
particularly if they're true."

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know
I'm a 30-some-year-old doctor

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:84%
with four kids,
a golden retriever,

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and a house in North Carolina,
so I'm going-

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:84%
This is down
the rabbit hole fast.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But that is the situation,
my friends,

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing with secrecy
that is criminal and illegal.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: In 1997,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:90%
in an effort to push his message

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.720 align:middle line:84%
deeper into Congress
and the White House,

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Greer headed to Phoenix
to prepare a video

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:84%
with his best evidence
to show in Washington, DC.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.820 align:middle line:84%
While he was
in the editing room,

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:84%
the biggest UFO-witnessed event
in history was about to happen.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:90%
KITEI: On March 13th, 1997,

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:84%
when the Hale-Bopp comet was
very clear in the northwest sky,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.670 align:middle line:84%
thousands of people were outside
trying to get a glimpse of it

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.300 align:middle line:84%
when they also caught
a glimpse of these orbs.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Giant orbs equidistant
in a V-formation

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of a mile to two-mile wide
in some very credible reports.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's
the particular area

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.980 align:middle line:84%
where these phenomena
keep popping up

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:90%
from my vantage point.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
living in the basin

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:84%
between the South Mountain
and the Estrellas

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
have told me that,
not only were they looking up

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:84%
at the Phoenix Lights
during the mass sighting,

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
but they've been looking up
at them for centuries.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.500 align:middle line:84%
DOVER: I live in
a community called Loop,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:84%
northeast of Flagstaff, on
the Navajo Indian Reservation.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to go back in time
one day before.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:23.300 align:middle line:84%
We saw six to seven lights that
were circling along the horizon.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.720 align:middle line:90%
The entire street came out.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
a block party.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Everybody turned off
their lights.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody sat
in their front yards,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and everybody watched
this unusual light show.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.160 align:middle line:84%
KITEI: I squeezed down
the best of what I found

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and finally came forward in 2004
with The Phoenix Lights:

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.330 align:middle line:84%
A Skeptic's Discovery
That We Are Not Alone.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.830 align:middle line:84%
SCHWARTZ: 10,000 people,
approximately, witnessed this -

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:54.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest experiences
of this sort ever recorded.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.340 align:middle line:84%
MITCHELL: The Phoenix Lights
phenomenon

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to be falsifiable
in any way.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It was being validated
by most everybody that saw it.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate,
shall we say, insult

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.810 align:middle line:84%
was the governor of the state
of Arizona, Fife Symington,

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.310 align:middle line:84%
finally calling
a news conference,

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:14.810 align:middle line:84%
saying that he has
finally got the answer

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.150 align:middle line:90%
to the Phoenix Lights,

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and he introduces
some staff member

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.820 align:middle line:90%
dressed up as a space alien.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:90%
People got very angry because

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.570 align:middle line:84%
here is the top elected official
of the state

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:29.080 align:middle line:84%
making fun of,
what I estimate to be,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.620 align:middle line:84%
close to probably
10,000 people saw this.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Under the watchful eye
of the public,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Symington retracted
his statement.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
If you had been here ten years
ago and standing out here

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and looking up there
at the lights and the view,

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:84%
you would have been astounded.
You would have been amazed.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:84%
CNN REPORTER: The so-called
Phoenix Lights

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.600 align:middle line:84%
were seen by many people
in 1997.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics say they were
military aircraft or flares,

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.940 align:middle line:90%
but not the former governor.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:84%
SYMINGTON: It was probably some
form of an alien spacecraft.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:90%
On our way to Barcelona!

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Barcelona!

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:90%
To retrieve the evidence.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.460 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Dr. Bravo.
- Hi there.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.960 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: Are you ready
for the trip?

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for the trip.
I'm so excited.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do some
very wonderful work,

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and I can't wait
to get the results.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.970 align:middle line:90%
SMITH: Upon arriving in Spain

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to look at the being
for the very first time,

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of skeptical.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely a game-changer
for my thought process

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to actually see it in person
than to see it on film.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we had to do
was go to the radiology lab

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:84%
'cause we needed X-rays and CAT
scans before we did anything.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The best we can get.
Do we understand...

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.600 align:middle line:84%
SMITH: The head radiologist
at the center saw the being

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and was quite impressed.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
she said was,

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.600 align:middle line:90%
"Wow! That looks like an alien."

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:24.480 align:middle line:90%
[LOW CHATTER]

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.040 align:middle line:84%
When the CAT scan images started
coming up on the computer,

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.960 align:middle line:90%
it was just profound.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I saw inside the bone.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw organs, bone material,
brain material.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this was not a hoax;
it was not fake.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:84%
That this was actually
some sort of living creature.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.310 align:middle line:84%
NOLAN: Right.
Well, if somebody made it,

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
they have a future
in microsurgery

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because they were
smart enough, then,

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:12.070 align:middle line:84%
to put in these millimeter-wide
bone holes

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:15.830 align:middle line:84%
where the arteries go in
to feed the bone marrow.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So, now the challenge is
to prove what it is, right?

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:84%
My interest, frankly,
is to disprove

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that it's anything unusual
or anything paranormal.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I would like to prove
that this is human.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I would like to prove that this
is just an interesting mutation,

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but obviously, if you leave
your mind open- or I should say

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.730 align:middle line:84%
if you leave your mind closed
to alternatives,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you'll never see what those
alternatives might actually be.

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In every situation
with scientists,

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.900 align:middle line:90%
your reputation's at stake.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have every
expectation that even doing this

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is going to lead to some ribbing
from some of my colleagues.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
that's perfectly acceptable

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.620 align:middle line:90%
because at the end of the day,

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:84%
who's going to validate
these things?

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.500 align:middle line:84%
If someone isn't willing to
step forward and do it right;

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.220 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to have it
sitting out there forever,

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.590 align:middle line:90%
hanging in limbo.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.720 align:middle line:84%
If you let other people
and their opinions

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.010 align:middle line:84%
stop you from believing
what you know to be true,

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:90%
then all you're doing is

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:84%
stopping the possibility
of progress.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Anytime anybody tries to study
this subject seriously,

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.190 align:middle line:90%
we're subject to ridicule.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm a full professor at
a relatively major university,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm certain that
my colleagues at the university

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.450 align:middle line:84%
laugh at me and hoot and holler
behind my back

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:84%
when they hear
that I have an interest

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
in studying
unidentified flying objects.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:84%
There's really a subtle kind
of suppression at play here.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't worry about
what the CEO of Enron thinks

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.470 align:middle line:90%
about what you say.

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:84%
You worry about
what your friends think.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You worry about what your
parents would think

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.300 align:middle line:84%
if you posted
whatever you care about

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.800 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook or something.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We take the risk
to appear to be a crackpot.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.230 align:middle line:84%
There may be people who are
going to be threatened by that

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.730 align:middle line:90%
for any number of reasons.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:84%
My feeling was that
I was involved

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.230 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of strange
activities,

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:90%
so I'd try to say to myself,

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.030 align:middle line:84%
"Lt's not look at this
with too much exposure"

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and mentioned it because there's
a question of credibility.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.410 align:middle line:90%
This should be the subject

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.950 align:middle line:84%
of rigorous
scientific investigation

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and not the subject
of rubbishing

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.210 align:middle line:90%
by tabloid newspapers.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.880 align:middle line:84%
HARZAN: MUFON is
the Mutual UFO Network,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was founded in 1969
by Walt Anders.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And our mission statement is
"The scientific study of UFOs

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.010 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of humanity."

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:84%
MUFON is the world's largest
UFO investigative organization.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We have approximately
3,000 members worldwide.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Approximately 500 of those
have their PhDs.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:84%
These are people who really
would like to delve deep into

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.320 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomenon
and try to figure out,

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.200 align:middle line:84%
not only what it is,
but how it's happening.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.200 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR:
Armed with what he thought

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.290 align:middle line:84%
was some of the best
available evidence,

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.210 align:middle line:90%
including the Phoenix Lights,

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Steve Greer organized
a Project Starlight briefing

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.500 align:middle line:84%
before several
Congress, Pentagon,

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and White House
staff members.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Things seemed to be on track for
disclosure.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:24.140 align:middle line:84%
GREER: We have the actual
schematic of the device

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and the internal,
all of it,

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.110 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of detail,
and this is a cutaway.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This was done and escaped
government control,

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:90%
whereas the Bentwaters case

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.830 align:middle line:84%
took twenty-some years
in England.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is in our possession
and not the Ministry of Defense

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Or it would never be found.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Where it would go into
a black hole.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.170 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: But then
the bad news came.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Shari Adamiak, Steve's partner
and long-time friend,

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:84%
along with Steve
and another team member

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:03.140 align:middle line:84%
were all suddenly diagnosed
with a malignant cancer.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.600 align:middle line:84%
GREER: I've had these
experiences

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.140 align:middle line:84%
since I was a child
or a young man,

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:84%
but to articulate them
so other people understand them,

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I need someone
with capacity to hear it.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.820 align:middle line:90%
She was that person.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:20.910 align:middle line:84%
GREER: I mean, it's been-
LODER: You can't resolve things.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:24.120 align:middle line:84%
-very hard for me
to get up every day.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, but...

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the last places
she wanted to come was here.

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So she asked that her ashes
be placed on the land,

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
so we put her ashes
around that tree.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't take anything
for granted, frankly,

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and so each time that I do
a presentation or lead a group,

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I think,
"This may be the last time."

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:84%
The thing that has
kept me going the most

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.770 align:middle line:90%
is not any external thing,

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:84%
but the experience of that
near-death experience

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:39.990 align:middle line:84%
where I know that there's an
aspect of us that doesn't die,

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that is why
I can go mano-a-mano

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:84%
with these elements
and not be afraid.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say "be afraid."
Not stand down.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has fear.
I've certainly had my fears.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you an anchor,
so that you can go forward.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.430 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: More than ever,

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer understood
what he had always sensed.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It was not the power of
a cosmic field or quantum vacuum

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that would propel us
into the new world.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It was the mind.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.400 align:middle line:90%
This really is the opening

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.370 align:middle line:84%
to an entirely new science
of consciousness.

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:28.910 align:middle line:84%
You can maybe
think of consciousness

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.580 align:middle line:90%
as a television set.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.950 align:middle line:90%
On the TV screen,

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.370 align:middle line:84%
you see pictures
and sounds and so forth.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you tried to find out
where that was coming from,

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and you looked inside
the television,

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:40.880 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to find it.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.050 align:middle line:84%
The signal is in
the radio waves around it,

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.550 align:middle line:90%
invisible to us,

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.590 align:middle line:84%
that's being interpreted
by the television

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:49.350 align:middle line:90%
as pictures and sounds.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is very much like
the state of how we understand

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:90%
the mind and consciousness.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.890 align:middle line:90%
GREER: Dr. John at Princeton

00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:00.320 align:middle line:84%
proved that putting
your awareness on a device

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that was a random number
generator would affect it.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have
this random number generator,

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's producing 50/50
ones and zeros.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you introduce
a person into the picture,

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and you tell them try
to affect it with their mind -

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.250 align:middle line:84%
to think more ones
or more zeros.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You measure that,
and sure enough what they found

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.420 align:middle line:84%
was that there are more ones
or more zeros being produced

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that correlate
to that person's intention.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:84%
You can see effects
being produced

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.760 align:middle line:84%
forwards and backwards in time,
which is really strange.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Distance doesn't seem
to matter as much.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You can get the same
strength of effects

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're right in front
of the RNG

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:36.640 align:middle line:84%
or if you're on the other side
of the planet.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
a non-local field,

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and it isn't limited
to your brain waves and body.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John had the opportunity
to ask the Dalai Lama

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.070 align:middle line:84%
if he thought the random
number generators themselves

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:52.120 align:middle line:90%
were conscious.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama
thought about it,

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and his reply was that
if you think they're conscious,

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.830 align:middle line:90%
then they're conscious.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:05.840 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Just like
consciousness can have

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.130 align:middle line:84%
positive effects
on the Zeitgeist or ether,

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.010 align:middle line:90%
it can also work the other way.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:17.100 align:middle line:84%
VALONE: Unfortunately, when you
start to deal with inventors

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.980 align:middle line:84%
who have anomalous results
that seem to be over unity,

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.440 align:middle line:84%
paranoia seems to accompany
that process.

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And John Searl's famous
for having

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:90%
a circular magnetic device

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that has both energy and
propulsion built into one unit.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:90%
MURAD: The electric company felt

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that this guy
was stealing money,

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.080 align:middle line:90%
took him to court,

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.460 align:middle line:90%
went to jail,

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.290 align:middle line:90%
his house caught fire,

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and all of his property
and all of his designs burned.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:50.180 align:middle line:84%
The concept of freedom,
this sort of idea

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.640 align:middle line:84%
of people having the liberty
to pursue happiness

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and to pursue abundance,

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:02.190 align:middle line:84%
this has been completely,
in a sense, turned upside down.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:04.270 align:middle line:90%
We actually reprinted

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:84%
a report on
the military involvement

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.490 align:middle line:84%
of the Department of Energy,
and it's so extensive.

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the major operation
that goes on there.

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.660 align:middle line:84%
LODER: There have been over
5,000 patents

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that have been sequestered by
the National Security State,

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.910 align:middle line:90%
taken out of the public domain.

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Many of them deal with
energy technologies.

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.040 align:middle line:90%
VALONE: It's a policy that

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.210 align:middle line:84%
the military seems to feel is
necessary for national security.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.050 align:middle line:90%
However, at this point,

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:34.890 align:middle line:84%
we often wondered 50 years after
World War II and the Cold War

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:37.560 align:middle line:84%
whether such sequestering
is necessary.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.600 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Suppression
of new technology

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.230 align:middle line:84%
would be an obvious
plague on the idea

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and strength
of a free market system.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it still seems to happen
right in front of our eyes.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is a huge controversy,

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest,
maybe most intense controversies

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.250 align:middle line:90%
in the history of science.

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:05.080 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing worse, I found,

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:84%
than suggesting to academic
physicists, in particular,

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.880 align:middle line:90%
and academics, in general,

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that they are, not only wrong,
but disastrously wrong.

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Catastrophically wrong.

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Cold fusion patents
have not been approved.

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.270 align:middle line:90%
They will not get through.

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.730 align:middle line:84%
American citizens
are being denied

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.520 align:middle line:90%
their constitutional rights.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I, inadvertently, was looking
through some piles of paper

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that had been given to me
in a casual manner

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.570 align:middle line:84%
by all these hot fusion
physicists

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:40.790 align:middle line:84%
as they were trying to do
their calorimetric repeat

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:43.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Pons-Fleischmann
experiment.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I was stunned. I couldn't
believe what I was seeing.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It looked like monkey business
to me at the time,

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and it has turned out
to be exactly that.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It was represented as a negative
result when it was positive.

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that data is scientific
fraud, as far as I'm concerned.

00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It's been referred to legal
authorities in the government.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I asked for a review at MIT,
got nowhere.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If this type of manipulation
had occurred

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in any "legitimate"
research area,

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.280 align:middle line:84%
such as cancer research,
AIDS research,

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.150 align:middle line:90%
global warming research -

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:18.280 align:middle line:84%
anything that's accepted
as reasonable to be researching,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.990 align:middle line:90%
people would lose their jobs.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't be in science.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And yet these people today,

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:25.100 align:middle line:84%
their data is used today -
year 2000

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and all before
to reject patents.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is serious
criminal activity going on

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately
must be rooted out.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It became very clear to me

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, you kind of had
a tiger by the tail here

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
and that this was serious.

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.540 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: For a moment,

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer considered
shutting everything down.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
He had been threatened and
swindled far too many times.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Shari was gone.

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
He had no office,
no staff, no money.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Back in 1998,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I was given information
by a friend

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Greer was
having a conference.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Literally the month
that Shari Adamiak passed away,

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
within thirty days,
I have this scheduled event.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:39.740 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the conference

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and learned some things
and listened.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.870 align:middle line:90%
So she just on a lark came,

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and she's an emergency doctor
like I am.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And what really
grabbed my attention was

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
he was getting
all this information

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.710 align:middle line:90%
from military witnesses.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1998.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
By 2000, when we were planning
and storyboarding

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and working the whole
Disclosure Project event out

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and pulling together
all these hundreds of witnesses,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.970 align:middle line:84%
we didn't really have
the funding to do it.

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But she got so supportive
and involved that

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that she lived very modestly and
took all of her excess income

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and donated it.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.070 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I want to acknowledge some
amazing people that are here:

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Jan Bravo,

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
without whom we would not have
the Disclosure Project.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just the funding
she's provided.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the moral support
and the encouragement

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and the friendship.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And so she's become
a very key person.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's sort of
metaphysical and odd

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
that literally the month
that Shari Adamiak passed away,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
within thirty days,
I have this scheduled event.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.810 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Not alone anymore,

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
with the support
of a loyal team,

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer grew his witness list
from a couple dozen

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:55.730 align:middle line:90%
to over 200.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.030 align:middle line:90%
CALLAHAN: See that little...

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that little dot right in,
that dot don't belong there.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm one of those,
what you would call...

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
the high government official
in the FAA.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I was the division chief.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I was only three or four down
from the admiral.

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I was awarded the Air Force
Guided Missile Insignia.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I was the first photographic
officer in the Air Force

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to get the- they called it
the missile badge.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So I forgot
who it was that called,

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
but he says,
"We got a problem here."

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
"What's the problem?"

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Well, it's that UFO."

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We weren't launching
real nuclear weapons.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We were launching
the dummy warheads.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
They were the exact size, shape,
and dimension, and weight.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.160 align:middle line:84%
That we were looking down
southwest,

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and the missile popped up
through the fog.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It was just beautiful.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Then I hollered, "There it is!"

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Then our guys
on our M-45 tracking mount,

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
with 180-inch lenses on it,
got it.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
We sent the film back down
to Vandenberg.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
CALLAHAN: A Japanese airline 747
was coming from the northwest,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
going across
the Alaskan territory.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
He called and asked
the controller

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
if the controller had
any traffic at his altitude.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
His radar is picking up
a target.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
He sees this target
with his eye,

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and the target,
the way he described it...

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
A huge ball
with lights running around it,

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and I think he said it was like
four times as big as a 747.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
JACOBS: I was called into
Major Mansmann's office

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
at the First Strategic Aerospace
Division Headquarters,

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.529 align:middle line:84%
and Major Mansmann said,
"Watch this."

01:05:04.529 --> 01:05:08.529 align:middle line:84%
There was the launch from
a day or two before at Big Sur.

01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.029 align:middle line:90%
We watched that stage burn out.

01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We watched the second stage
burn out.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We watched the third stage
burn out.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's going like this,

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and into the frame
came something else.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It flew into the frame
like this.

01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It shot a beam of light
at the warhead.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Fires another beam of light.

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Goes around like this.
We're going like this.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Fires another beam of light.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Goes down like this.
Fires another beam of light.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And then flies out
the way it came in.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The warhead tumbles
out of space.

CALLAHAN: They brought in
three people from the FBI,

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%
three people from the CIA,

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and three people from
Reagan's scientific study team,

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know who
the rest of the people were.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.279 align:middle line:90%
When they got done,

01:05:47.279 --> 01:05:52.529 align:middle line:84%
they actually swore
all these other guys into-

01:05:52.529 --> 01:05:54.330 align:middle line:90%
that this never took place.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the guys
from the CIA.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, I saw that.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't give a goddamn what
anybody else says about it.

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.840 align:middle line:90%

Phil Klass can kiss my ass.
He wasn't there. I was.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
He said this is
the first time they ever had

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
thirty minutes of radar data
on a UFO.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You are never
to speak of this again.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
As far as you're concerned,
this never happened."

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "Yes, sir."
and walked out,

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and that was the last I talked
about it for 18 years.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I had the original video
that I took,

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.380 align:middle line:90%
and I had the pilot's report,

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and I had the FAA's
first report.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
That was all downstairs
on my table.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ask for that,
so I didn't give it to them.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
There are things I know about
that I did in the service

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that I won't talk to you about
now because they're top secret,

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and I could get my ass in
trouble for talking about them.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%

Major Mansmann said, he said,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
"You're to say
this never happened."

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not classified
or top secret, is it?

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was a part of a
United States Air Force cover-up

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%
for 18 years.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%

What we photographed up there

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
affected me
for the rest of my life,

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and made a huge impact on
my understanding of the universe

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and of governmental manipulation
of our minds.

Dr. Greer had the firepower
to attack Washington again.

CBS REPORTER: We are not alone.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
a group of pilot scientists

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and former government officials
want Congress to hear.

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
21 members of that group already
have testified in Washington

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
for what's known as
the Disclosure Project.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
GREER: And we had all volunteers
who organized that whole event,

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.090 align:middle line:90%
and there was no paid staff.

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So when people look at
that whole period,

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:22.220 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have an office,

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%

and one paid staff person,

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.729 align:middle line:90%

over our WSA,

fired pencil-thin beams of light
into them,

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and adversely affected
the ordnance possibly.

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
There were bodies
that were involved

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%

also some were alive.

QUIJANO: What do members plan
to do with their information?

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They hope Congress and
President Bush take notice.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
GREER: We are asking
for the US Congress

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and for President Bush

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to move towards
an official inquiry

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and disclosure
on this subject.

"Will you testify, in detail,

NARRATOR: The number of people
Dr. Greer

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.729 align:middle line:84%
had managed to get behind him
was monumental.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.190 align:middle line:84%
In a perfect world,
an event of this proportion,

01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:00.820 align:middle line:90%
with that amount of coverage,

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
would have been enough to start

the question
on some people's minds

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%

about space-based weapons.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
First, the Russians
were the enemy

against whom we're going

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%

GREER: Ninety-nine percent
of all the information

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
out in the public
on this subject

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
is well-crafted disinformation
designed to scare people

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to support the next phase
in global warfare.

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%
This kind of corruption

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is why the only things that are
being made on this subject

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
are things that read down
to paranoia and fear

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and the military
industrial complex.

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.630 align:middle line:84%
REAGAN: I occasionally think
how quickly

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
our differences worldwide
would vanish

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
if we were facing
an alien threat

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.180 align:middle line:90%
from outside this world.

01:13:57.809 --> 01:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
we're moving forward

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:01.770 align:middle line:90%
if we trade, you know,

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.110 align:middle line:90%
factional and ideological war

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
from one ethnic or religious
or economic system

01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:08.820 align:middle line:90%
into an interplanetary conflict

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's
A-- not survivable

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
and B-- would be even worse

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:15.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
galvanizing the world

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:19.040 align:middle line:90%
around a military structure.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That has been the central
organizing principle

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:23.830 align:middle line:90%
of our society

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
for a few thousand years,
actually.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: It is hard
to concretely prove

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that 9/11 was
a false flag attack

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.140 align:middle line:90%
because the people behind it

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
are so good
at covering their tracks,

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
especially with the compliance
of the mainstream media.

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
If you had trillions of dollars,
you'd be pretty good at it, too.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
RUMSFELD: The adversary's
closer to home.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:52.610 align:middle line:90%
According to some estimates,

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
we cannot track
$2.3 trillion in transactions.

01:14:56.490 --> 01:15:00.410 align:middle line:84%
(ECHO) $2.3 trillion
in transactions.

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
According to the Comptroller
General of the United States,

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
there are serious financial
management problems

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:08.090 align:middle line:90%
at the Pentagon.

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal year 1999:
$2.3 trillion missing.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Fiscal year 2000:
$1.1 trillion missing,

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and the D.O.D.
is the number one reason

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
why the government
can't balance its checkbook.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
I would like for you to respond

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to the questions that
I've put to you today.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten what
the second question was.

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: There are
two main types

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.720 align:middle line:90%
of Special Access Programs:

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged and
unacknowledged, or USAPS.

01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Certain USAPS
are waived

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and also completely managed
and controlled

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
by private contractors,

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
so they enjoy
the secrecy protections

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
only afforded
to private corporations.

01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
There's virtually no high-level
government oversight

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:28.420 align:middle line:90%
for these types of USAPS.

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
In many cases
no elected official,

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:31.750 align:middle line:90%
including even the president,

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
have knowledge
a particular USAP even exists.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Between 1947 and 1949,

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
the government passed
the National Security Act

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and the CIA Act.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
These laws allowed
the intelligence community

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to withdraw money
from any agency

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
without disclosure.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, money could be
stolen from any program,

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and no elected official
would ever know about it.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Um, great view
of the eye socket.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Very different eye socket.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing that
the scientist who looked at this

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:13.840 align:middle line:90%
at Stanford have commented on.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
If you look at this creature,

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the cranial vault,

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.430 align:middle line:90%
how large it is.

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:21.510 align:middle line:90%
That the size from the eyes up

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
is at least three times that
of a human.

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:28.350 align:middle line:84%
NOLAN: One of the first things
that Dr. Lachman

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
immediately remarked upon

01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
was the shape of the head
and the skull.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It was not something that
he is accustomed to seeing,

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and it was quite interesting
and, in some ways, exciting

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that the associated features
that you would expect

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:45.200 align:middle line:84%
from a syndrome of that nature
were not found.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
This specimen does not fall
under any known, to me,

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
class of disorders
or syndromes.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
In many respects,
the proportions of the spine

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.809 align:middle line:90%
and extremities are normal.

01:18:05.809 --> 01:18:07.559 align:middle line:84%
The major abnormalities
appear to be

01:18:07.559 --> 01:18:11.480 align:middle line:84%
1-- the size of the specimen,
mid-face hypoplasia,

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.520 align:middle line:90%
and underdevelopment of the jaw,

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and that the specimen
has only ten ribs.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Humans normally have twelve,
rarely eleven.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the most remarkable
aspects of this

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
is when we came down to study
the actual bone density.

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the features of fetuses
that a specialist looks at

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
is the so called "growth plates"
or the epiphyseal joint,

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
say of the knees.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The shock, I think,
and the surprise was

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and the absolute certainty
that Dr. Lachman had

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.640 align:middle line:90%
was that this specimen is

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
between the age of
six to eight years old.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
The shock was that this specimen
was clearly not fetal.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
how something six inches tall

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:04.160 align:middle line:90%
survived to any length of time

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
that would allow for it
to survive

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.410 align:middle line:90%
100 or 1,000 years ago?

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
LODER: And what amazes me
is the media,

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
while they're so compromised
in this,

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.850 align:middle line:84%
they don't dare do anything but
follow the company line, right?

01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The company line being
a series of lies.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a document talking about
the current program at the CIA,

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and it says that the PAO -
Public Affairs Office -

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
has relationships
with reporters

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
from every underlying
major wire service,

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
newspaper, news weekly,

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and television network
in the nation.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
In many instances,
we have persuaded reporters

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to postpone, change, hold,
or even scrap stories

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that could have adversely
affected national security.

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's the purpose of this?

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The CIA has no mandate
for anything domestic.

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The FBI is domestic.
What the hell is this?

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.760 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Where are we now?

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.720 align:middle line:90%
We are in a bread and circus.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a phrase used
to describe the creation

01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.270 align:middle line:90%
of public approval,

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
not through excellent
public policy,

01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
but rather through diversion
and distraction.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not doing that.
I'm sorry.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
You are driving me nuts.

01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
GREER: Keep people fat,
keep them happy,

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
keep them diverted,
and keep them entertained

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
with dribble and shock
and nonsense.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
That's, unfortunately,
the sort of thing

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
that has taken the place
of news and information.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
WILCOCK: So that
what we're seeing today

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is a world in which perception
is being managed

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:51.600 align:middle line:84%
by as little as five major
media corporations

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.680 align:middle line:90%
who collectively control

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.309 align:middle line:90%
magazines, newspapers,

01:20:56.309 --> 01:20:58.480 align:middle line:90%
corporate news websites,

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.190 align:middle line:90%
television stations,

01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:02.320 align:middle line:90%
movies, documentaries.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.780 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Who are these people?

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Who could be behind the curtain?

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Who could possibly be
controlling us so effectively?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
A shadowy government

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
with its own Air Force,
its own Navy,

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:22.880 align:middle line:90%
its own fundraising mechanism,

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to pursue
its own ideas

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
of the national interest,

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
free from all checks
and balances

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and free from the law itself.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
MITCHELL: Whatever activity
is going on

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.540 align:middle line:90%
to the extent that it is -

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.550 align:middle line:90%
the clandestine group,

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.840 align:middle line:90%
the quasi-government group,

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
a quasi-private group -

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:16.809 align:middle line:84%
it is without any type,
as far as I can tell,

01:22:16.809 --> 01:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of high-level
government oversight,

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and that is a great concern.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%
[RADIO STATIC]

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.030 align:middle line:84%
the very word "secrecy"
is repugnant

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:32.610 align:middle line:90%
in a free and open society,

01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and there is very grave danger,

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:38.160 align:middle line:84%
for we are opposed
around the world

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
by a monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%

01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:01.120 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: It seems to be

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
it only takes one person
to make contact,

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
but hundreds of voices
worldwide

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is a call
that can't be missed.

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.470 align:middle line:90%
And likewise with innovation,

01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:13.340 align:middle line:90%
the more heads in the game,

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
the more likely we are
to find a solution.

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:18.059 align:middle line:84%
LODER: There's many, many
technologies

01:31:18.059 --> 01:31:20.430 align:middle line:90%
that people have talked about.

01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Many ways to the mountaintop.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
We have so many modes
of converting

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.230 align:middle line:84%
quantum vacuum energy
or zero point energy.

01:31:27.230 --> 01:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
they know how to do it.

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Okay, fine.

01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it theoretically,
that's one thing.

01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But then you've got to do it
experimentally,

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and that's the hard part.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Those opposed
to new energy technologies

01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
can tie the hands
of hundreds of inventors,

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
but how will they ever fare

01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:47.880 align:middle line:90%
against tens of thousands?

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.090 align:middle line:84%
NUNEZ: The output milliamperage
is more

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:54.430 align:middle line:90%
than the input milliamperage.

01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a clear indicator
of over unity.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
When you oscillate
or vibrate magnetic fields,

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
there's an effect
in the gravity field.

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And how to do that linkage

01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is what you're trying to get at,
as I understand it.

01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Maxwell's Equations
are in that term right there.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
What happens is if you're gonna
have a gravitational effect,

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.080 align:middle line:90%
it's gonna happen over there.

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:17.380 align:middle line:84%
BOARDMAN: This channel here
represents

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.800 align:middle line:90%
revolutions per minute.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
These are representing

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
weight that we're measuring
on the load cells.

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Full steam ahead.

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:43.700 align:middle line:90%
MURAD: When we look at our data,

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.700 align:middle line:90%
we lost seven percent of weight.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.210 align:middle line:90%
We move this thing,

01:33:48.210 --> 01:33:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and it loses weight.

01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I must be generating
gravity waves.

01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
BOARDMAN: Though the device
maintains its shape and size

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.210 align:middle line:90%
in terms of dimension,

01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:59.840 align:middle line:84%
it is losing mass,
if that's a possibility.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.300 align:middle line:90%
If it is losing mass,

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
then certainly it would
also be affecting time

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.510 align:middle line:90%
in a very localized manner.

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:08.100 align:middle line:84%
MURAD: By looking
at new technology,

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you could break through
new commercial aspects

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to improve our society.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
BOARDMAN: We should be looking
for a disruptive breakthrough

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in this technology
within the next ten years.

01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We're on the brink
of developing any number

01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:24.950 align:middle line:90%
of potential propulsion systems

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:26.990 align:middle line:84%
which would take us
out of the solar system.

01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
beat NASA to the mark.

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
HARZAN: So I graduated from
the UCLA School of Engineering

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in 1976.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I got a flyer from
the School of Engineering

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
inviting me to a lecture
by Ben Rich.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.590 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR:
Ben Rich was the director

01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
of Lockheed Skunkworks
for sixteen years.

01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:45.139 align:middle line:90%
He oversaw a number of USAPS

01:34:45.139 --> 01:34:47.559 align:middle line:84%
that were secretly managed
at the Skunkworks,

01:34:47.559 --> 01:34:49.480 align:middle line:90%
including most notably

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.309 align:middle line:84%
the development of
the F117 stealth fighter.

01:34:53.309 --> 01:34:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Ben shared a slide set

01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of about forty slides
of different things,

01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:58.980 align:middle line:90%
starting with the U2 spy plane

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
going all the way up
to the stealth fighter,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.700 align:middle line:84%
mentioning that he couldn't talk
about the other secret stuff.

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.580 align:middle line:90%
But when he ended his talk,

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:10.830 align:middle line:84%
he had a slide of a black disc
zipping off into outer space.

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And he ended this talk
with these words:

01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
"We now have the technology
to take ET home."

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:20.590 align:middle line:84%
MURAD: So you have
to have vision

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:22.219 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
the guts and the courage

01:35:22.219 --> 01:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
to go out past the steps
and do something of any value,

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and we have to go past
our grasp.

01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And we asked him questions:
What did you mean when you said

01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.940 align:middle line:84%
we have the technology
to take ET home?

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Ben shared three major things

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that I think are worthy
of research

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.780 align:middle line:84%
by researchers worldwide
at this point in time.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The first was
we've somehow figured out

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
how to do interstellar
travel already; it's known.

01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:49.200 align:middle line:90%
The second point he made was

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that there was an error
in the equations.

01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:53.330 align:middle line:90%
My suspicion is it's probably

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Maxwell's Equations
for Electromagnetic Theory.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The third thing he said was,
"How does ESP work?"

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
kind of startled

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
'cause I didn't know what
to say, but I blurted out,

01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
"I don't know. All points in
time and space are connected."

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me back
in the eye, and he said,

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.680 align:middle line:90%
"That's how it works."

01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:17.770 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: History has taught us

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
that to simply innovate
new technology

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.070 align:middle line:90%
may not be enough.

01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:25.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to find a way
to get past the suppression.

01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We've already now
had a breakthrough

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
just a couple months ago
of the tritium battery.

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Finally a company
has come up with

01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:34.620 align:middle line:84%
an actual
commercializable unit,

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's very small.

01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:41.090 align:middle line:84%
It's designed for an IC
or some small circuit component.

01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:42.920 align:middle line:90%
So this is a good sign

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
because it shows the way to
introduce a free energy device

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.340 align:middle line:84%
is to introduce
a small version of it.

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:50.219 align:middle line:84%
If you have a revolutionary
energy device,

01:36:50.219 --> 01:36:52.059 align:middle line:90%
it has to be introduced in a way

01:36:52.059 --> 01:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't look like
it's a revolution.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.980 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE WHIRRING]

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Science is always changing.
Even back in the 1960s,

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
they thought that biofeedback,
for example, was impossible.

01:37:09.370 --> 01:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But now we know that that itself
is an absurd statement

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
as we have even
toys on the market

01:37:14.290 --> 01:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that allow people to, you know,
play with biofeedback.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
These sciences have been around
for decades.

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.420 align:middle line:84%
They have been ruthlessly
kept secret

01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:31.719 align:middle line:84%
because of the kleptocracy of
what I call the petro fascists,

01:37:31.719 --> 01:37:34.309 align:middle line:84%
the people who are hell-bent
on maintaining

01:37:34.309 --> 01:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
the power of
a centralized petrodollar,

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.230 align:middle line:90%
oil, gas, coal system.

01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So that does create scarcity
because that is a zero-sum game,

01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but when you take us
off that system

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.360 align:middle line:90%
onto this new system,

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.950 align:middle line:84%
it's an entirely new
macroeconomic order

01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and scarcity becomes
nonexistent.

NARRATOR: After years
of disappointments,

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Greer and his team
are now attempting to build

01:37:59.210 --> 01:38:01.710 align:middle line:84%
an energy research lab
in Virginia

01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
where scientists and inventors
with working prototypes

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:09.170 align:middle line:90%
will have a safe haven to build.

01:38:12.469 --> 01:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
NOLAN: So this is an example
of how the analysis is done

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.270 align:middle line:84%
using what's called
a genome browser,

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and it's more or less

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
a schematic representation
of the chromosomes

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and at a very high level
of resolution.

01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence that we got
from the mitochondria

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
tells us with extremely
high confidence

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that the mother was
an indigenous Indian

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.500 align:middle line:90%
from the Chilean area,

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.380 align:middle line:90%
and the haplotype is called B2A.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, the other thing that

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:50.760 align:middle line:84%
immediately fell out of the
analysis is that it's male.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It has so-called
Y-chromosome material.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's got
a full Y-chromosome.

01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It probably died
in the last century

01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:59.139 align:middle line:90%
if I were to make a guess.

01:38:59.139 --> 01:39:01.139 align:middle line:84%
I can say
with absolute certainty

01:39:01.139 --> 01:39:03.770 align:middle line:90%
that it is not a monkey.

01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Right. It is human,
or as close to human,

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.240 align:middle line:84%
closer to human
than chimpanzees would be.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.320 align:middle line:90%
But when you count up

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the number of mutations
that we're observing,

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.700 align:middle line:90%
what we're seeing is more

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
than what we would expect to be
caused by simple cell division.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
When the sequencer is creating
or making these reads,

01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
it's doing it more or less
at random.

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So what does
the computer program do

01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that people have written
and designed?

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It takes every one
of the little sequences

01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and tries to match it
against the known,

01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:42.059 align:middle line:84%
and then anything
that doesn't match,

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it puts in a little side file
and says, "This is unknown."

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:50.570 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
when enough knowns are matched,

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I can feel comfortable saying,
"Ah, this is human," right?

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.620 align:middle line:90%
But if I'm not careful,

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and I don't pay attention
to what's in the garbage can,

01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:01.910 align:middle line:84%
what the computer program
is throwing away,

01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I could be throwing the baby out
with the bath water.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
What we've done
is we've scaled back,

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing
several chromosomes

01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and pieces of chromosomes
across the top,

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
which basically leaves us
with a very strange conundrum.

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:19.389 align:middle line:84%
Right. Here you've got
this six-inch-tall

01:40:19.389 --> 01:40:20.969 align:middle line:90%
let's call it human, right,

01:40:20.969 --> 01:40:23.889 align:middle line:84%
because the DNA says
that so far it's human,

01:40:23.889 --> 01:40:26.190 align:middle line:84%
at least the way
that we're looking at it.

01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:28.190 align:middle line:90%
This gene PCNT,

01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:31.980 align:middle line:84%
which is known to be associated
with primordial dwarfism,

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't have
any mutations here.

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It lived to the age of
six to eight.

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it was breathing,
it was eating,

01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:42.830 align:middle line:90%
it was metabolizing,

01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't living
in an environment

01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:48.290 align:middle line:84%
where there was a lot of
advanced medical attention

01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:49.880 align:middle line:90%
that was given to it

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to allow it to live to that age.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Calls into question how big
the thing might have been

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.800 align:middle line:90%
when it was born.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.969 align:middle line:84%
So genetically
you might explain that

01:40:58.969 --> 01:41:03.469 align:middle line:84%
by saying that there's some
advanced aging mutation,

01:41:03.469 --> 01:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
something that caused the bone
to age anomalously quickly.

01:41:08.190 --> 01:41:11.980 align:middle line:84%
A gene that's known to be
associated with progeria,

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that also- no changes there.

01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So the next problem,
of course, is the ribs

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and the number of ribs
in the specimen:

01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:24.040 align:middle line:84%
only ten whereas there's
supposed to be twelve.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So there are no mutations

01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.100 align:middle line:84%
which are associated with
that kind of phenomenon

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's rarely,
if ever, seen.

01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:33.300 align:middle line:90%
The digits are all correct.

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.340 align:middle line:90%
The hands are all correct.

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.630 align:middle line:84%
There are problems
with the face.

01:41:37.630 --> 01:41:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's a mid-face
hypoplasia,

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the larger skull.

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:45.139 align:middle line:90%
So again, I think, in summary,

01:41:45.139 --> 01:41:49.350 align:middle line:84%
there are genes associated
with any one or two

01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of the anomalies that we see
in the specimen,

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%
but there is no mutation
which is known

01:41:56.030 --> 01:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate or call
for all of the mutations.

01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Even with the things
that we know

01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:05.200 align:middle line:84%
could be assigned to one
or more of the anomalies,

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't find them in
the genetics of this specimen.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.920 align:middle line:90%
That leaves open the question:

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.710 align:middle line:84%
what genetics is causing the
anomalies that we are observing?

01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So although I answered this
thinking DNA was the answer,

01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.800 align:middle line:90%
it made me realize

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that in the context
of the bigger biology questions,

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are
other levels of control

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that need to be understood
and answered:

01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:34.690 align:middle line:84%
the non-coding RNA,
epigenetics, etcetera,

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and things that we probably
haven't even thought of yet.

01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So if I just look at this
base pair 19,800,000 or so

01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:45.530 align:middle line:90%
at this edge of the open region.

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:46.950 align:middle line:90%
I can go all the way over here,

01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm at 21,000 or 22,000.

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
So the answer's not finished,

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's not as easy as,
actually, frankly,

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going to be
at the beginning.

01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
2,000,000 base pairs of DNA

01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:04.090 align:middle line:90%
where nothing seems to sit.

01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the way
societies do things.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.770 align:middle line:90%
They try to fit things in boxes.

01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:11.600 align:middle line:84%
We have written a computer
program that does exactly that,

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.850 align:middle line:90%
tries to fit it into the box.

01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't seem very efficient,

01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:17.940 align:middle line:84%
so on that basis
people would call it junk,

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.320 align:middle line:90%
but I think we now know

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.660 align:middle line:84%
that there's any of a number
of other features

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of what DNA's doing in there.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It is expressed,

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and so we need to be careful,
obviously,

01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that we don't let our instincts

01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:36.500 align:middle line:84%
or the programs that we write
to match our instincts

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.000 align:middle line:90%
make the decisions for us.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.630 align:middle line:90%
No matter what, for me,

01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:45.139 align:middle line:84%
this has been a fascinating,
more than an exercise.

01:43:45.139 --> 01:43:47.389 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I've collated
this information

01:43:47.389 --> 01:43:51.480 align:middle line:84%
into a form that other people
can take advantage of

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.809 align:middle line:84%
and it's accepted for
publication,

01:43:54.809 --> 01:43:56.309 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to put it
out on the web.

01:43:56.309 --> 01:43:59.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't have
the resources

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to study and follow down
every single angle

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that this opens up,
but you know,

01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe there is
a listener out there

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.080 align:middle line:84%
who will be sufficiently
intrigued by this

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to do the analyses themselves.

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they'll find something
that I missed. Great.

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:18.920 align:middle line:90%
If additional samples

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.760 align:middle line:90%
or examples are seen of this,

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll be the first in line
to want to sequence it

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.389 align:middle line:90%
because then all bets are off.

01:44:28.389 --> 01:44:30.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to say other things here,

01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:34.639 align:middle line:84%
but I also don't want
to open myself up for,

01:44:34.639 --> 01:44:37.020 align:middle line:90%
you know, attack.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.860 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: This search
may have uncovered

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:44.240 align:middle line:84%
a major finding about
life in the universe

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and its origins.

01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:50.370 align:middle line:90%
What is this being?

01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Could it be a missing link
in evolution?

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Could it be
an entirely new species

01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:03.420 align:middle line:84%
or simply a disease
we have never seen before?

01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Or could this be
an extraterrestrial being

01:45:09.850 --> 01:45:12.389 align:middle line:90%
from another world?

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the case may be,

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:27.820 align:middle line:84%
this challenges the boundaries
of human scientific knowledge.

01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Garry Nolan
has set a new precedent

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:36.200 align:middle line:84%
for scientific investigation
and rigor

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:41.040 align:middle line:84%

4,000 cases

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680 align:middle line:90%
that have landed,

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.430 align:middle line:90%
3,500 pilot cases,

of pages of documents

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:06.650 align:middle line:84%
from fourteen countries
that have opened their files

01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:10.820 align:middle line:84%
since the Disclosure Project
was launched eleven years ago.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And yet...

01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And yet...

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.450 align:middle line:90%
this isn't on CNN every night.

01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably
the most important thing

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.000 align:middle line:84%
going on in this planet today,
and yet nobody talks about it.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If we don't explore what to do,
we're going to miss the boat.

NARRATOR: And that could be why
Eisenhower's final message

wasn't just doom and gloom.

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a charge to the people

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.180 align:middle line:90%
to spit out the bread,

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.270 align:middle line:90%
look away from the circus,

01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and take some responsibility.

01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Only an alert
and knowledgeable citizenry

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:48.570 align:middle line:90%
can compel the proper meshing

of the huge industrial and
military machinery of defense

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.120 align:middle line:84%

The United States
is not yet among them.

GREER: What we have to do

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is pave the way
for these leaders

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:36.240 align:middle line:84%
because if the people will lead,
the leaders will follow.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.870 align:middle line:90%
They'll have to.

01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't about
overthrowing the Pentagon.

01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about leaving it behind.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.920 align:middle line:90%
My goal, when I started this,

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.590 align:middle line:84%
was to make this so that
I wasn't important at all in it,

01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:51.969 align:middle line:84%
that there would be
enough people

01:47:51.969 --> 01:47:53.590 align:middle line:90%
that they'd go on without me,

01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:56.389 align:middle line:84%

as a people,

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.809 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to find

01:48:06.809 --> 01:48:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us
working together

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.780 align:middle line:90%
are going to be able to create

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:12.990 align:middle line:90%
a world that is amazing.

01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:15.200 align:middle line:90%
If every single one of us

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.870 align:middle line:90%
told everyone we know

01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're being visited
by intelligent life,

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that the sciences are here
to give us a new civilization,

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:26.540 align:middle line:84%
we're liberated from
that macroeconomic slavery.

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the destiny of humanity.

01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much.
God bless you all.

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.590 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.570 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: What we've
come to learn is this:

01:48:57.570 --> 01:49:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We are standing at the precipice
of a new age.

01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:04.250 align:middle line:90%
There is power in the many,

01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
but only when
they're acting as one.

01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:09.670 align:middle line:90%
That's when resonance happens,

01:49:09.670 --> 01:49:12.670 align:middle line:84%
whether joining together
as a responsible citizenry

01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:16.219 align:middle line:84%
against the forces standing
to divide us...

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.600 align:middle line:84%
or joining consciousness
to unite with the beings,

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.850 align:middle line:84%
who are prepared
to communicate with us.

01:49:32.650 --> 01:49:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In order to succeed
in this endeavor called life...

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.370 align:middle line:90%
we must come together as one.
