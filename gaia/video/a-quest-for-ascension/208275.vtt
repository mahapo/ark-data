00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up in the country.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a brother
three years older,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and we played all day
every time we were free.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was wonderful, until
I was almost six years old,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and my brother and
I were in the house,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
listening to Gene
Autry on the radio.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was an
interruption, and the voice

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
said that Pearl Harbor
had been bombed.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something
terrible had happened,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't understand what.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I asked questions about that.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean, war?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw there
in the news of killing

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
was something that grew in
me for a very long time of,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:90%
what is this emptiness?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
What is this kind of world that
the adults seem to be living?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that really
ultimately directed my life

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and what I studied.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I had the deepest need
to try to understand,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was there really meaning
anywhere in the world,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
or was this dreadful worldview
that our science had taught me,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that everything
is simply matter?

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There is no meaning
and no purpose.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We're a fluke of nature,
an accident they just

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.665 align:middle line:90%
happened to happen.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And when
we're dead, we're dead.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
"You are dust, and to
dust you will return."

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I found limitations in both
religion and the science story,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
so I had to sort of
trek out on my own

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and see what my ancestors
had experienced.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Did they know something that
my culture, Western culture,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
did not know or had forgotten?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
We have to know how we got here.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:18.043 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is William Henry.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm an investigative
mythologist, author,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and researcher.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I've written 18 books on the
subject of ancient history

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and mythology and especially
human transformation.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Today we are suffering
a global malaise.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
We have especially
so many young people

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that are literally depressed.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:90%
They're frustrated.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They're on the
verge of wondering,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
how do we continue
in this world?

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
of this existence?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we've been called,
we're a species with amnesia.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:90%
What have we forgotten?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have forgotten
our true spiritual nature.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we've also lost touch

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:90%
with our true inner power.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I am not surprised in the
least that we have so much

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
mental illness and
so much addiction.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We do have all of these
things in the outer world

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and the meaninglessness
of it all.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So the point of studying
ancient civilizations

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is to discover
whether or not they

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
knew something that
we don't, something

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're capable of, but
that we have forgotten.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
These people had made
discoveries about nature

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
in their own bodies that we
couldn't even have imagined.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And they developed
techniques to open to that,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
another dimension of reality.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Each of us dies to
our old self when

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
we take the journey to
discover the higher self.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Rahelio.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a spiritual guide in Sedona.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself an
American-born Toltec.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:90%
My ancestry comes out of Mexico.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So coming into Sedona, people
drive in and see these red rock

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:90%
mountains.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:90%
It makes people open.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:90%
They're touched by the spirit.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
The red rock country
has especially

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
been sacred to Native people.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
In the rocks, you can see the
faces of the ancestor spirits.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Sedona is one of the major
power spots here on the planet.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And for the Native people, the
Mother Earth is their religion.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The Sky Father is
their religion.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:90%
The whole universe is alive.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is a
living, sentient being.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
She has an energy life system.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:90%
She has vital organs.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
She has an acupuncture
meridian grid system.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
You see that when you look
at the Native American dream

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:90%
catcher with the spider web.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It is the acupuncture
of the Earth.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's making a grid
all over the Earth.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And these power places
are acupuncture points.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as a living
Mother Earth, we're

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
mirroring the human being.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And like in a
medicine wheel, you

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
have an eastern pole
and a western pole.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The east pole of the planet is
the world's highest and largest

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:90%
plateau.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the plateau of Tibet.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So they have their
four sacred mountains.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The male plateau, the highest
pinnacle in the world,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:90%
is Mount Everest.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the west
pole of the planet,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.825 align:middle line:84%
the second largest plateau,
this is the Colorado plateau.

00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Colorado plateau,
the Indigenous people

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.498 align:middle line:84%
have their four sacred
mountains here also.

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
There are shrines
in those mountains,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and they make pilgrimages there.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So their work is to hold
the balance of the planet.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Canyon is like the
womb, the womb of the mother.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:90%
The water is flowing.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So where is the largest
canyon in the world?

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It is the Grand Canyon,
the Colorado River.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And so Mount Everest,
Grand Canyon, yin and yang.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
These are two major
hubs of the world.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
So Sedona is a part of this.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
This is an emanation of
the Mother Earth's soul.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And quite often, we can
be in delayed evolution.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:90%
We can be stagnant.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So we make pilgrimages to these
places on the dream catcher

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
grid of the Mother Earth,
pilgrimages to these places

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:90%
that will quicken the awakening.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And we as human
beings, we think we're

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
contained in our own little
minds and our brain here.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But when we step beyond the
box of our own consciousness

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and open ourselves, we become
one with the whole planet.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:90%
We become one with the sky.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We have the sky
wisdom within us,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and we have the Earth
wisdom within us.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So we come to these
power places to remember

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
who we are, that we are
connected to the greater.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There's quite a
science about that,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
about places on the Earth where
the electromagnetic energy is

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
greater.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So temples were
built on these spots

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to trigger these
potentials within us.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It existed in Egypt.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Egypt was very much a part
of that ancient culture,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
or it was a recreation
of it, perhaps.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the High
Middle Ages in Europe

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Renaissance of
these ancient traditions,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
much of this information
just exploded into culture.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
There were so many
cathedrals that

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%
were built during that time.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that 22,
I think, of the cathedrals

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
did have a labyrinth
on the floor

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that was a symbol of the journey
that we all take in life.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:90%
You have the question.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
You enter the labyrinth, and
you walk around and around

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and down until you come to the
center, which is the deepest

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:90%
part of who we are.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:10%
At that spot, you confront the
divine, the universal mind,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:10%
the all, not as
other, but as self.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was the secret
of these cathedrals.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And of the cathedrals
in France, someone

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
pointed out that
they're really built

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
on the pattern of the star
constellation of Virgo.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever seen the
star constellation of Orion?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Researchers stumbled on the
idea that Orion, the three belt

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
stars were the Great Pyramid of
Egypt, the next large pyramid,

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and the third small pyramid.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So they documented
and said, wow.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Orion is laid over Egypt.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Other researchers
here in the Southwest

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:84%
have looked at this
Orion constellation.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The three belt stars of Orion
are the three Hopi Mesas.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
These three belt stars
are also in Mexico.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacan, the
City of the Gods.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:10%
And so Native
people here and also

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:10%
other places around the world
put the stars on the Earth

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:10%
with standing stones and
pyramids and other shrines.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people today are
talking about the concept

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:90%
of ascension.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.730 align:middle line:10%
In many ancient
ascension stories,

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:10%
we learn of a hero who
transforms and then ascends

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:10%
or journeys to a
higher heavenly realm.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Call it Heaven.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Call it the Garden of Eden.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Call it whatever term you like.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists call
it the Pure Land.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But part of the
idea of ascension

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is that ascension
is also a quest

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
for wholeness while on Earth.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Numerous ancient
spiritual traditions,

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
including the Christian and
the Tibetan and the Egyptian,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:84%
tell us that within us
is this light being.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not something we go get.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It is something
that we already are.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And every experience
in our life is

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
designed to help us to uncover
this divine nature within,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
as happened in the
story of Jesus.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.902 align:middle line:84%
It's also exemplified in the
story of the Tibetan guru

00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Padmasambhava.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
once we have connected

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
with that aspect of
ourselves, we now

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
are in possession of
true spiritual power,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
true spiritual understanding.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the hidden tradition
that Jesus taught was

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the ancient tradition of how
to go inward and experience

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:90%
the Christ within.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
That is, to experience cosmic
or Christ consciousness.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Nag Hammadi
texts were text

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of those early
centuries in which Jesus

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:90%
talked about going inward.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
been destroyed,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
but the monks at Nag
Hammadi buried them,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't found
until after the war in 1945,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that the
Dead Sea Scrolls were only

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:90%
found in 1945 as well.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We see Jesus saying, I
did not come to save you.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I came to remind
you of who you are.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
You have forgotten that we
all come from the light.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you drink from my
mouth, you and I are one.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
This was the hidden
tradition of Jesus.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
He was someone who had
achieved that ability

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to experience
cosmic consciousness

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:84%
or universal mind, and he
wanted us to know that we all

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:90%
have that ability too.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In its original form,
Christianity was not about

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
people becoming Christians.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:10%
It was about people activating
the Christ or the light within.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes referred
to themselves

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:90%
as perfect light humans.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
That word perfect
and perfection means

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
to become more whole,
more holy, more complete,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
more compassionate.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Humans could
transform into angels.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians described
their god of resurrection,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Osiris, as the perfect one.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:10%
In Tibet, they
speak of dissolving

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:10%
the body, the physical
flesh and blood

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:10%
body, into five-colored
rainbow light,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:10%
or what they call the
rainbow light body.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
The term that the Tibetans
use for this teaching

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:90%
is the great perfection.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars of Southern
France maintain

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that they were reincarnations
of the Essenes.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:84%
They refer to themselves as the
perfecti, or the perfect ones.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
has been lost in church dogma.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:10%
Now my family wasn't
particularly religious.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:10%
We went to church on
Christmas and Easter.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a
wonderful school here

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
in Nashville called
Belmont College.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And because this college was
a Southern Baptist college,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
one had to take
Bible study classes.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And our professor
assigned us to review

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
a book whose implications
would impact Christianity.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So off I go to the
local bookstore,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's a brand new
international bestseller

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that's on the shelf.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
The book is called
"Holy Blood Holy Grail."

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:10%
20 years later, this
would be the book

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:10%
that inspired Dan Brown to
write "The Da Vinci Code."

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But back then, it was
very unknown material.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And this book had
caused a bombshell,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
because its premise,
based on French history

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and French legend, said that
the crucifixion of Jesus

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
was a hoax, that he
survived the crucifixion,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and that after the
crucifixion, Jesus and Mary

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene and their
proposed family

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
moved to Southern France.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And they left their
most coveted secrets,

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
their cherished
secrets of original

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or what they call primitive
Christianity in Southern

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
France.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's David Lorimer.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.695 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking from the
Cathar region of France.

00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Cathars were a
group of people, a movement,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
who regarded themselves
as the true Christians.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:84%
They tried to follow the
original teaching of Jesus.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They also believed in this
inner light and the inner life.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the great
heresy of the time.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And if the Roman Catholic
Church of the day

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
represented the
law and the letter,

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
then the Cathars represented the
spirit, and indeed the heart.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
The Consolamentum was one of the
main sacraments of the Cathars.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point
was for people

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to experience that they
essentially were immortal.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It went back, I think,
to an early transmission

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity with
the legend or history

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that Mary Magdalene
came to this area

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and preached in Languedoc
for 20 or so years.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:10%
This tradition of
Mary Magdalene that

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:10%
is the divine feminine,
the partner of Jesus,

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:10%
is very alive around here.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This tradition
sees Mary Magdalene

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
as an initiate who was, in
fact, the successor of Jesus

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:90%
after his death.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Her ascension teachings
became hugely influential

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to the Cathars and others
on the Gnostic trail.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that
possessed those codes.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that
possessed this knowledge.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's through her
lineage that all of us

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
ultimately are given sort of
a golden string, if you will,

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that can take us directly back
to Jesus and his ascension

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the Grail
story was exactly that.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the male going
out into the woods,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:90%
the place of the unknown.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the labyrinth.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And everyone and everything
he meets on the way

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
allows him to learn
something about himself

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and about nature and
life and its purpose.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Grail is the
finding of the soul,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of that higher consciousness,
the meaning and purpose

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it would mean the masculine
and feminine coming together.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a story that
ignited all of Europe,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:90%
you might say, at that time.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Grail is still
a sacred symbol today,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
because we are
still missing that.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What's relevant for our
time is precisely this gnosis

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:90%
or deeper experience of oneness.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It's realizing your
divinity as a human being.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And the religious
institutions, they

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:84%
regard themselves as
the intermediaries

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:90%
between humans and Heaven.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But they can't
necessarily provide

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the kind of deep meaning that
we're talking about here,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's something which
is personal and experiential.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
people are looking for.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
direct experience.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
just for ideas.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That is the difference.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
In our ancient traditions, we
could experience who we are.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we did experience that,
we knew there is no death.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We knew that life is continuous,
that consciousness continues.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
We also know we're
divine and that we

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
have evolved to be
co-creative with the universe.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How can we have
faith if we don't know?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:90%
How do we have faith in Heaven?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.597 align:middle line:84%
How do we have faith in the
lords of light, the divine ones

00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
that are here to guide us?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
How do we have faith in that
when people are channeling.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Are they delusional, or are they
in alignment with the truth?

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:84%
People say, I need to
experience for myself.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.015 align:middle line:90%
I need to know for myself.

00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
You have to knock and
the door shall be open.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Seek and we shall find.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We have to go out
on a vision quest.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I am Ravi Ravindra,
born in India.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was only
about 18 years old,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
suddenly something is
saying to me, Ravi,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
why you were born.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize that you
didn't create yourself?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, this
resonated so deeply in me

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that I just wanted to find
some understanding of what

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:90%
the great sages have said.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
What has created me or
created the universe, and why

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:90%
am I here?

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose
of my existence?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the main call in
the spiritual teachings

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
is really a radical
transformation

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
of the whole of
my being so that I

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
can come closer and closer to
the level of Krishna, Buddha,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Christ, God.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you go to one
of the non-canonical gospels,

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
gospel of Thomas, kingdom of God
is within you and without you.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
If you would know God,
you must know yourself.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in every
serious teaching,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
there is a great deal of
emphasis on self-inquiry.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the Yoga
Sutras or in the Bhagavad Gita,

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
the word that is used
in Sanskrit, svadhyaya,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:90%
self-study.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:10%
That's almost one of
the practices of yoga,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:10%
to search for why the
universe has been created,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:10%
why I have been created.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
What will happen when I die?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Is that the end of
everything in me?

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
See, according to all
the religious teachings,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
death of the body is not
the death of the person,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
as if the person is
something in the body,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
but not wholly the body.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Then one wonders, what
happens when the body dies?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that does not
die, something that is eternal?

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the mid-20th century,
spiritualists have begun

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the
near-death experience.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:84%
More and more, we're
hearing of this experience

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
where people are
dying for a time,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
they're traveling to a
higher frequency realm,

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
they're engaging
with loved ones who

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
have already deceased
or angelic-type beings.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They're returning to
their body, and they're

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:90%
coming back to life.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
This experience has been
reported by millions of people.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's so
important, because it

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:10%
validates the existence
of a spiritual reality

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:10%
beyond our world.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
The near-death
experience is helping

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
us to prove that we continue
to exist into the afterlife,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
that we go on and on and on.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Classically as an example,
let's say your heart stops.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Then everything flatlines.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Your brain activity stops.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's what
happens or what is

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
reported to happen during that
period of unconsciousness.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the
normal neurophysiological

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
brain and consciousness,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
then no experience
should happen at all.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
It should be absolutely blank.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet it does
happen, which suggests

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that there is something more
to the brain-consciousness

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
relationship than is currently
understood by neuroscience.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But for years,
anyone who had a vision,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:90%
it was called a hallucination.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It was even listed as that.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
This has always been, if
we haven't experienced it,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:90%
we have no idea.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:90%
We can't imagine.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But when we're there, we know
that consciousness is eternal,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and that we are born into
many lives in matter.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a miracle
death is, that whatever

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
we identify as self steps out of
the body and is then in spirit.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think also today, many
people, as I and my husband

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
did too, experience the
consciousness of someone

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
we love after the
death of that person.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And we did experience our son's
consciousness in detailed ways

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:90%
for long periods of time.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
He wanted us to remember
that death is not the end.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can have faith that
there is a good place for us.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
If you've died and come back,
you have no fear of dying.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You have no fear
of these things,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.395 align:middle line:84%
because this world
is only an illusion.

00:21:57.395 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a school ground for us
to learn the mastery of love.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This is so important, because
if more and more people can

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
eliminate the fear of death and
have that true understanding

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that our existence on Earth
is temporary and that we have

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
a more permanent or eternal
existence in the afterlife,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and we eliminate
the fear of death,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that completely
transforms our world.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That is also one way
of realizing how little we

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:90%
actually know.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Any great sage will
say, more they know,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
more they realize
how little they know.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So I need to have
kind of an open mind

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that I could learn something
that may surprise me.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, one of the leading
philosophies in our world is

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
also one of what I think of as
the darkest philosophies ever

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
conceived, and this
is called materialism.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Materialists believe
that you and I are just

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
matter, that we are
just energy and motion.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We are just molecules,
that there is nothing

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
spiritual dwelling within
or animating our bodies.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's true that the
brain produces consciousness

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is entirely
localized, then telepathy,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
survival of death, experience
of other dimensions,

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
that just can't happen.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what these
people come up against

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:90%
is what I call impossible facts.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is really the crunch.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
If something has
happened, it's happened.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And your theory needs to address
and explain what's happened

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:90%
rather than explain it away.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient wisdom tradition
says that the soul manifests

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the body as a vehicle for
incarnation, for exploration,

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to work out spiritual
goals, or for karma.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the
ancients believed

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that our soul is the
animating force that

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
manifests our physical body
on this physical plane.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is what today's
culture has to remember.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> To a large extent, we
exist in a spiritual vacuum.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And what it goes
back to, I think,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is the denial of a transcendent
reality, the denial

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of a divine dimension and the
spiritual dimension to life,

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
which began to gather
pace in the 18th century

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and continued in
the 19th century

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%
when Nietzsche said "God is
dead," and a lot of people

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
seemed to agree with him.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So science was from
the get-go in the West

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily limited.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't, of course,
until the last century

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
with the development
of quantum physics

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:90%
that it came full circle.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And we finally
now have a science

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that is becoming
worthy of the universe.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting to realize

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that the mystics talk
about the quantum field

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, except
they call it spirit.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And the
physicists will say,

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field
is a vast ocean

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of light and consciousness,
and it records everything

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the mystics would
add, yes, it is infinite.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we do
is recorded in spirit,

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is a vast ocean
of consciousness,

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and they would add
of love and light.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's very similar.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
What the mystic has
experienced is now

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:84%
being identified by
the quantum physicist.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Max Planck gave an
interview to "The Observer"

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:84%
in 1931 in which he
made a famous remark,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that he regarded
consciousness as fundamental,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and that the mind is the
matrix of all matter.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what this
does is this puts him

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in the category of
people who believe

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that the mind in a
sense comes first,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and the mind is primary
as a shaping force.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> As spiritual beings, we
have to connect with our base

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
reality, with our true reality
which exists beyond this realm.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Call it the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Call it the Pure Land.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Beings are coming and going from
these higher frequency realms

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:90%
into our world.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have to keep
that connection alive

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and infuse this world with
the light of that realm.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think science
actually can address these

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:84%
inner questions, because science
by and large looks at phenomena

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:84%
from the third person,
from the outside.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
But purpose only
comes from the inside,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's a realization
that we come to.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality or mysticism
is the complementary of this,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.770 align:middle line:84%
because spirituality deals
with the inner, the subjective,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and at some point,
the transcendent

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and then what goes beyond what
we immediately understand.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So spiritual mysteries
always remain occupation

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of an individual who wishes
to relate with the real.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Just because the Buddha
related with the real,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that now
I don't have to do it.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, what has
happened-- largely,

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:84%
this actually began with
the Scientific Revolution--

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
the emphasis there is that only
the reason can lead to truth.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, ultimately only
science can lead to truth.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Musicians can go to hell.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They don't do anything.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Poets, painters, none
of this has any truth.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Truth is only
because of science.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Whereas even the greatest
scientist will tell you--

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I will quote one actually from
Pascal, a very highly regarded

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
scientist.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Heart has reasons
that reason does not know."

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a symbolic mind and
we also have a conceptual mind.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The symbolic mind has a
poetic logic of its own.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:10%
But both are
necessary for the mind

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:10%
to experience its own wholeness.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And intuition is
a great gift, you

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
might say that we have,
is that ability to think

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
with the heart, feel, intuit.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about a divine
masculine and a divine

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
feminine.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:84%
These are actually aspects
of our consciousness.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:10%
The masculine and feminine
that we're speaking about

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:10%
is within us.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
We all have an inner male
and an inner female side.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We might think of them
as our logical side

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
being our masculine side and
our more intuitive, nurturing,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual side
being the feminine side.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The key thing is that when we
have both sides of ourselves,

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the inner male and
the inner female

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
both saying yes
to the same thing,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that's when real
positive momentum occurs

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and when transformation suddenly
just becomes really easy

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:90%
and starts to flow.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what I recommend
that we want to get the male

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and the female saying
yes to is to becoming

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
more whole, more holy, more
complete, more compassionate.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything I've been
sharing is about awakening

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.590 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is the yin
and yang, mind and heart.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
healing this duality, the male

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and the female sides of us.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We've been in a patriarchal
system, and in this time now

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.568 align:middle line:84%
there's this trying to bring
fair play back to the feminine,

00:29:23.568 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
because we've all been wounded.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We all have a little
anger and rage within us.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have to heal the
inner feminine within us,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the inner feminine
and find balance,

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
because we all had
made our mistakes.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:10%
And so if we embrace the
Hawaiian term ho'oponopono--

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, please forgive
me, I love you, thank you--

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:10%
you do it for those
around you, not as

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:10%
if you're trying to heal them.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But you're healing them
that's inside of you,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because their woundedness is
your woundedness, because we

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.460 align:middle line:90%
are all wounded that way.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, please forgive
me, I love you, thank you.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You heal the wounded male,
female, child within you.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You can heal the wounded male,
female, child outside of us.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:84%
All true traditions
have this teaching.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, "Forgive
us our trespasses

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
as we forgive those who
trespass against us."

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Ho'oponopono.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists are having
chants and mantras, healing,

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:90%
loving, and forgiveness.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Love and forgiveness.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We all have to love and forgive,
because this world will pass,

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.700 align:middle line:90%
but the Heaven realms will not.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We want to bring
Heaven down here.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And so as me learn to love
and forgive ourselves,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
the sacred marriage
of male-female

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:90%
can take place within us.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Ego is a good servant
but a bad master.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:84%
If this occupies the
whole of my life,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not really attending to
why this element of the spirit

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.480 align:middle line:90%
has taken his place in me.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So in every serious teaching,
there is always this call

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
that I need to leave my usual
ego-oriented self, which is

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:90%
just occupied with me, me, me.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Power, wealth, pleasure.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Self-occupation.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So unless I can be a
little free of that,

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
there is no way I
can come to God.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we incorporate some
of these concepts in our daily

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:90%
What are things that we can do?

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, first and
foremost, we always

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
have to recognize the
power of our thoughts

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and the powers of our emotions.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to transcend
our lower nature.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The key is to see
ourselves already having

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
attained our highest spiritual
functioning and our highest

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
spiritual abilities,
and to begin

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:90%
to live from that perspective.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge then is
to go into your imagination

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and think, OK.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:84%
When I'm at this
higher frequency,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I will be maybe eating different
foods, reading different books,

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:90%
meditating more perhaps.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I will be traveling
to certain places.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:84%
We need to get really
specific and come up

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
with a to-do list of 20,
25, 30 different, new things

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that you'll enjoy doing
mentally, physically,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, and
emotionally when you're

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:90%
at that higher frequency.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step is to
start doing those things.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And automatically,
your belief will

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
change because you are
changing what you're doing.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know what
you believe about anything,

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:90%
look what you're doing.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We have no idea
what we're capable of.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:84%
How do we operate this
incredible beingness

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:90%
that we're born in?

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the ancients used
dance, music, isolation,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:90%
fasting, long meditation.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
I think those are ways.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, sacred plants,
but used in a very sacred way.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Many Indigenous people
knew our potential

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:90%
to be in two places at once.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
We hear that.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't believe it.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But there were many, many
things that we are told

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:90%
from these ancient cultures.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're true.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
pretty powerful.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
If we can go within with
the intention of what

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.250 align:middle line:84%
we want to achieve,
we can get pretty far.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And we can get even farther
if we work together on it.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiritual practice is central
to all spiritual traditions.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There are prayers, exercises
with formulas, meditation

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:84%
practices and
breathing practices.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And it requires will
to persist in doing

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
these exercises every day.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It's easier to stay in bed.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The body is meant to be
the instrument to assist

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of the soul.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes I use
another expression.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.480 align:middle line:90%
This is actually from St. Paul.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Body is the temple
of the spirit.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:84%
One can get so occupied
with the temple

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that one is not paying
attention to the spirit that

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:90%
might descend.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, there is no
reason to be against the temple

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
if the temple is right,
quiet, et cetera,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
so the spirit can
actually descend.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Truth is something
that has to be lived.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're always
looking for our roots.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to be
defined by a story that

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't serve our true self.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so Toltec wisdom
has been passed down.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:84%
There have been very
secret lineages.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I met Don Miguel Ruiz,
and I saw his writings

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
about the Four Agreements.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:10%
And these four agreements,
simple as they are,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.340 align:middle line:10%
are very difficult for
people to practice.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.489 align:middle line:84%
The first agreement is to be
impeccable with your word,

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because your word
makes manifest.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.225 align:middle line:90%
So we speak our reality.

00:34:52.225 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:90%
It is like abracadabra.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I speak it into manifestation.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It all begins with the power
being impeccable with our word,

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that we don't speak in a way
that sabotages our reality,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that we don't speak in a way
that sabotages those around us.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So this also connects to what
I call the four attributes

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual warrior that
comes from Toltec wisdom,

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and that is it begins with
the power of prayerful intent.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The second agreement is
don't take things personal,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:90%
because people begin to--

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.300 align:middle line:84%
they're in their own healing
process, their own growth

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't take it personal,
because people

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.610 align:middle line:90%
are projecting their shadows.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take their
negative energy in personally,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
you can get sabotaged by
becoming too wounded by that.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:84%
The second attribute of
the spiritual warrior

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is compassion,
compassion for yourself,

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:90%
compassion for others.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The third agreement is
don't make assumptions.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're
talking to somebody.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You can make assumptions
that they mean,

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:90%
this is their intention.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really know
until you look within

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and look at what's going on
and investigate for yourself

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.650 align:middle line:90%
what the truth is.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's the third attribute
of the spiritual warrior.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Use your intelligence
to understand.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:84%
What is my silent wisdom
telling me is the truth?

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:84%
We have our authentic
voice within us,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and we have this rational mind
that will rationalize and lie

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like, put that thing quiet.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:10%
Look within and sense
your inner silence.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.580 align:middle line:10%
And the fourth agreement
is do your best

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:10%
and don't be
attached to results.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to
the fourth attribute

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual warrior,
and that's patience.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.320 align:middle line:10%
So when we do our best and
surrender our attachment,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:10%
because we're surrendering
to the will of Heaven,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.600 align:middle line:10%
that takes us back to the first
attribute, prayerful intent,

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:10%
that we are aligned
with the will of Heaven.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
All positive and good
things are coming to me.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.440 align:middle line:84%
All positive and good
things are here for me now.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This journey of
transformation has many stages.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the radical transformation
of the whole of my being.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is called by
Christ as having a new birth.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to be born again, born
of the spirit, born from above.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So how can I become an
instrument of God's will?

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:90%
That is the call.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I am an aficionado
of sacred art.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:84%
For over 20 years, I have been
studying the ancient belief

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that art is actually a portal
or a gateway into higher realms.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I first started learning
about this in ancient Egypt

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:84%
where the temple
walls were literally

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:90%
considered to be alive.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:84%
In the early Christian
world, they used icons

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:90%
as an open-eye meditation.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're taught that the icon
was literally a sacred mirror.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
A part of you was actually
feeling that vibration

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of transfiguration as you
were looking at the image,

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
because the image was considered
to be a sacred mirror,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:90%
a portal, or indeed, a gateway.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.830 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans teach that
Padmasambhava as an avatar

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:10%
can transmit the codes or
vibrations of the rainbow light

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.210 align:middle line:10%
body through that image.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Modern-day artists
like Nicholas Roerich

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.660 align:middle line:84%
have also shown us through
their works images that

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:84%
can guide us into deep
states of meditation

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and help us to connect
with our light body.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a very key
meditation technique

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that is taught in
numerous traditions,

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and one we can use today.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You can find an image
of the transfiguration

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:84%
or of the rainbow
light body and remember

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.950 align:middle line:84%
that this is my
true spiritual self,

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and use that image as
a point of connection

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
between your earthly self
and your transcendent self.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the things that
sometimes people get as if they

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:84%
need to be rid of their body
and just only connect with

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:90%
the spirit.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:84%
That the world can go to hell,
I will just go to a monastery

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
or I go to the Himalayas, and
I will meditate and become free

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:90%
or liberated.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
completely contrary to most

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual teachings.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:84%
After all, if God has created
this world, this universe,

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:90%
why should we be against it?

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I often remind people
that we are-- each one of us

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is a child of both
Heaven and Earth.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Both need to be honored.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The spirituality
isn't an escape hatch.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's engaging fully
with the world,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:84%
but not being of the
world in the sense

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that one belongs to
something larger.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Be in the world, but not of it.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The common denominator among
all these spiritual traditions

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.610 align:middle line:10%
is that they're ultimately
talking about alchemy.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And the mission of those
on the light body path

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.040 align:middle line:84%
is to perfect the Earth plane,
to raise the entire planet

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
into a higher state
of perfection.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.850 align:middle line:10%
That is the goal of the awakened
who are on the light body path.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately not to
leave Earth and migrate

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:16.980 align:middle line:90%
to another planet.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not ascension.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.140 align:middle line:84%
That's just moving from one
physical plane to another one.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Ascension is more a
spiritualization of our planet,

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:84%
of transforming it into a
planet where light and love are

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the base frequency instead of
fear as the base frequency,

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.270 align:middle line:84%
as many of us
experience it today.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Golden rule says that what we
put out is what we get back.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we're tending to
focus our energy on fear

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and negative
emotions, then that's

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
what the world is going
to mirror back to us.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> One understanding of the
so-called dualism of Cathars

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
would be to say that they see
the world as an arena where

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
light and darkness are
competing in some way.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the spirit represents
the light and the darkness

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
is represented by the
prince of the world,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
by evil, broadly speaking,
but also love of power,

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
love of money, love of
influence, love of control.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a remark of
the famous Sufi sage Rumi.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:84%
If you have not yet seen the
devil, go look in the mirror.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole external
universe in principle can be

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.245 align:middle line:84%
mirrored inside us,
including the devil.

00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:84%
This is important
to keep in mind,

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
because if everything
in the universe

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:84%
can be mirrored inside
me, why not the devil?

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:84%
After all, he is also
part of the universe.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Even the devil has
his proper place.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.720 align:middle line:84%
After all, the devil
is also a son of God.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:90%
He didn't create himself.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.370 align:middle line:90%
He's also created by God.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And he is, in any case,
the head examiner.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:90%
He's always testing everybody.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:10%
You can certainly
see this in the Bible

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:10%
or you can see this in
the story of the Buddha.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can be
enlightened or be allowed

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to come to God or to
Heaven unless they

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:90%
have been tested by the devil.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:90%
What is the test?

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Usually, what is it that
is driving the whole world?

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:84%
More pleasure, more
wealth, more power.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there anybody among
my whole audience who

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:90%
is not driven by these forces?

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I am certainly.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally ask
myself honestly,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:34.820 align:middle line:10%
how many million dollars would
take me to betray something?

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.950 align:middle line:84%
People need to ask
this quite genuinely,

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.900 align:middle line:90%
personally to really inquire.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And then if that doesn't work,
then the other side is fear.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:90%
How can I be free of this?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Love heals fear, but people
speak of the word love all

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:84%
the time, but they can't
heal themself by themself,

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.960 align:middle line:84%
because it's wounded
as their child.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to recover
our inner child

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.640 align:middle line:84%
so that the wisdom
of that inner child

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.840 align:middle line:84%
can blossom into a
spiritual warrior.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.930 align:middle line:84%
If we make amends
for our mistakes,

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.990 align:middle line:84%
take total responsibility
for what we are creating--

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry for my
mistakes, great spirit.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry for my shortcomings.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Please show me the way.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Help me to awaken on my path.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Today, this day, show
me what I need to learn,

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and that you may speak
through me as you wish,

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that I may be a clear
conduit for your wisdom.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Knock, ask, you shall receive.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to have faith
in the higher power.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And who we were the year
before, we may have successes.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We may have had
spiritual realizations.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But we have to drop it and
start brand new fresh today.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It's time for you to wake
up, remember, and learn.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think of the
Kogi, for example.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.830 align:middle line:84%
These people in Colombia,
high in the Sierra Mountains,

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.230 align:middle line:84%
they know so much about
science and the cosmos.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And they actually talk to
the masters of the universe,

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
they tell us.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But they say this, and
that's why I bring them up,

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and that is that mind creates
the scaffolding for matter.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I think that's brilliant.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.560 align:middle line:84%
They knew that it
is consciousness

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that creates matter, which we
only know with quantum physics,

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
primary and creates matter.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And they took the
responsibility to try

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to hold the world in order.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And they do the meditation and
the talking with the spirit

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:84%
world to try to
keep us balanced.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:90%
But they're saying, we can't.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:84%
There's too much destruction
and too much sorrow.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And they say that we are dumbing
down the universe because

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:90%
of our thoughts.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're not only
dangerous for ourselves.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We are destroying matter,
according to the Kogi.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> People ask me all the time,
can we really ascend during

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:90%
our time?

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It's getting so dark out there.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And my answer to that
is this is the time

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.360 align:middle line:84%
when we most need to have
these ascension teachings.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:84%
When you think about the
Essenes and the Cathars,

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:84%
they met some of the most
darkest and oppressive forces

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
on the planet and were
able, indeed, to overcome.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Individuals on their own can
make an enormous difference.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.070 align:middle line:84%
If they decide
that they are going

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to focus on love over
fear, focus on power

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:28.240 align:middle line:84%
rather than disempowerment,
that has a ripple effect.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:90%
That has an exponential effect.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So if our world
continues to go darker--

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's starting
to move into the light.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.720 align:middle line:84%
As we all know, the night
is darkest just before dawn.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the time
now where we've got

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to redouble our efforts
to control our thoughts,

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to control our emotions, and
especially to keep ourselves

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.460 align:middle line:84%
in the most loving
possible space,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because this is the only way
that we're going to bring

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.640 align:middle line:90%
the light into our world.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
that will leave you

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
in connection with your
true divine nature.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate
purpose of our time.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:84%
We are being
challenged, and we have

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to rise as champions
on this occasion.

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The light shined
in the darkness,

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and never shall the
darkness overcome it.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> What we are up against now
is the result of all of these

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.570 align:middle line:90%
centuries of suppression.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
There are four periods
of Renaissance in Europe

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in which this ancient tradition
of who we are emerged.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Each of those periods
was suppressed

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and repressed violently
by the powers that be.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.820 align:middle line:90%
This is the fifth period.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
It has emerged today
I think full force.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So many more people
know about it.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.880 align:middle line:84%
This period is an exciting
period with quantum physics,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.800 align:middle line:84%
with near-death experiencers,
with visionaries of all kinds.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the fifth Renaissance.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't see what
could happen to us

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.160 align:middle line:90%
if we don't make it this time.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that we can
really survive on the Earth,

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:84%
meaningfully for
sure, unless we allow

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:90%
this awakening to take place.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take the
wholeness of the human mind

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:84%
to confront it and allow
itself to be transformed.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I do have hope, but I have
kind of what I call conditional

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.720 align:middle line:90%
hope.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Hope has to be enacted.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have to move
in the direction of your hopes

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to take the necessary
action to be

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.500 align:middle line:90%
part of a movement for change.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen all by itself.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We are at a critical
juncture of our evolution.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we go along with the
reckless advance of technology

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.590 align:middle line:84%
without considering
its implications,

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:52.400 align:middle line:84%
then I think we're on
the destructive path.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a very good
quote from EF Schumacher.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
He said that humanity is
now "too clever to survive

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.540 align:middle line:90%
without wisdom."

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think there also
is a huge potential

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.210 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual awakening.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.280 align:middle line:84%
There's an old
Chinese proverb, which

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I think applies to our time.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Rather "light a candle
than curse the darkness."

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> A question that is more
and more on people's lips is,

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.380 align:middle line:90%
are we living in the end times?

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, I believe we are
in a version of the end times.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe based on my research
that the Book of Revelation

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is the script that we are
following at this moment.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I have studied prophecy
extensively from all

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the Hopi people,
their prophecies

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.860 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the
Maya prophecies,

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the Christian
prophecies, the Buddhist

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:90%
prophecy.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there's going to be
a great awakening coming.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.110 align:middle line:84%
They speak of this time of the
Earth as going out of balance

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.710 align:middle line:84%
now, because the age
is coming to an end

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.600 align:middle line:84%
as we're getting ready to
begin into a new cycle.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So they speak, and
prophecy and visions

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:84%
have been had about
what can go wrong.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.608 align:middle line:84%
We can see the waters
of the ocean turn black.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
What's been happening
in the last 20 years?

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Oil spills.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And people speak of the
black snake, these pipelines,

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.500 align:middle line:90%
and they're breaking also.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they speak
of this time where

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:90%
the cycle's coming to an end.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Our world is going
out of balance

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.830 align:middle line:84%
now because we are
living in disharmony

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.930 align:middle line:84%
with the natural
order of things.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.780 align:middle line:10%
The greater cycle is
coming to a quickening.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.420 align:middle line:84%
How the future
unfolds for us depends

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.260 align:middle line:84%
on how much human beings
awaken to the divine.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Also today, a lot
of the scientists

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.180 align:middle line:84%
are talking about the solar
flares coming in, that we

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:90%
have the Carrington Event.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Happened late 1800s.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
In the past, they've
discovered that there

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.930 align:middle line:84%
have been solar flares
that have hit the planet.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:48.730 align:middle line:84%
No problem, because
we had no technology.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But today, we are dependent on
technology or electrical grids.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.870 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
worst case scenario.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the galaxy's
pulsing waves of energy.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The more energy
comes from the sun,

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.900 align:middle line:90%
the more people get activated.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.020 align:middle line:84%
There's agitation, so much
energy that people cannot

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.610 align:middle line:90%
assimilate it.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.750 align:middle line:84%
We are not living
in balance with it.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So we are needing a
divine intervention.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.800 align:middle line:84%
We are needing a return
of the Maitreya Buddha.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:84%
We are needing a
return of Jesus Christ.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We are needing return
of Quetzalcoatl.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We are needing a return of
the sacred divine feminine.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:29.110 align:middle line:84%
The return of the divine
is coming, is already here.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to have faith and
know that they are here,

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:84%
waiting for us to wake
up, and guiding us.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We are destined for
Heaven on Earth.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:42.790 align:middle line:84%
As we awaken, those of the
light are coming to help us.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have to help ourselves
first by doing the work.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.170 align:middle line:10%
There's a woman named Dolores
Cannon, her hypnosis subjects

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:53.860 align:middle line:10%
in the '80s talking about this
new Earth and the volunteers,

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.750 align:middle line:10%
the three waves of
volunteers who came in

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:10%
to bring in a frequency of love,
forgiveness, and creativity,

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:10%
and solutions to problems.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So the time of the great
awakening is coming.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, everybody says,
what's my mission?

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:09.540 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:10.755 align:middle line:90%
What am I here for?

00:51:10.755 --> 00:51:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It is to bring love and
positive frequency no matter

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.752 align:middle line:90%
what you do.

00:51:14.752 --> 00:51:16.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
something important.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:84%
The simplest things,
all we've got to do

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.955 align:middle line:84%
is be present as
whole human beings

00:51:20.955 --> 00:51:22.400 align:middle line:90%
and walk the Mother Earth.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And as this time of
split comes, choosing

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.975 align:middle line:90%
to go in the natural sacred way.

00:51:27.975 --> 00:51:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that doesn't
mean our technology

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is bad, because it can
be used in a good way.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember
to put the spirit first,

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to awaken spiritually,
use it for the spiritual.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we are at a
very great opportunity.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
As we have this
chaos upon us now.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The order is awakening
within us when

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.900 align:middle line:84%
we turn away from attachment
to the outer drama

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and begin to awaken to
Heaven on Earth here

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and now, Heaven within me.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The power of our faith
creates miracles.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is why we have to
stick to the spiritual laws

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.320 align:middle line:90%
that actually work.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
The golden rule is the
number one spiritual law,

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that what we put out
is what we get back.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.790 align:middle line:90%
You can call that karma.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:90%
You can call it the golden rule.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Love your neighbor as yourself.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.210 align:middle line:84%
That is quantum entanglement
in a spiritual law.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that is
the path forward.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Love with all your heart, all
your mind, and all your soul,

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and love your
neighbor as yourself,

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:36.580 align:middle line:84%
because we are
ultimately all one.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Your neighbor is your self.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So as you treat
your neighbor, you

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.900 align:middle line:84%
are now setting up how you
want to be treated yourself.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't like how
the world's treating you,

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:49.420 align:middle line:84%
change how you're
treating the world.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:53.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate
spiritual message.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:57.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And it was in Bulgaria that
a sage called Peter Deunov

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.310 align:middle line:10%
appeared.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:02.060 align:middle line:84%
He described himself as the
prophet of a culture of love.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the main
formulas is the disciple

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.480 align:middle line:84%
must have a heart as
pure as a crystal,

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.270 align:middle line:84%
a mind as bright as the sun, a
soul as vast as the universe,

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and a spirit as powerful
as God and one with God.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The destination may
be God or enlightenment.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But whatever I know
about God is very much

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.780 align:middle line:90%
conditioned by my mind.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But truth is not
stuck in one language

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.260 align:middle line:90%
or in one culture or one nation.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom, great insights are
transreligious, transcultural.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, the labels
vary, whether it

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is called God or Allah or
Brahma or sometimes simply

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.960 align:middle line:84%
absolute, or simply
that, because it's

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.030 align:middle line:90%
difficult to label it.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.060 align:middle line:84%
All the sages have said
that they can't really

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:58.990 align:middle line:84%
describe its real nature, that
the language is not sufficient.

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So gradually, one begins to
be a little less occupied

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
with the destination,
more concerned

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:09.490 align:middle line:90%
with the journey itself.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Then one sometimes have one
step forward, one step back,

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.040 align:middle line:90%
or one step sideways.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But the search
becomes interesting.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Just have faith and trust
that greater powers are

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.360 align:middle line:90%
at play.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.330 align:middle line:84%
His representatives
are here to guide us

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
if we listen to the silence of
our inner knowing, the higher

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.270 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And that wisdom is like an ocean
of bliss, of love, of light.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Many mystics have
encountered it.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And so as we turn to the
wisdom of the great teachers,

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.730 align:middle line:90%
we also can know that as love.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's through the power
of grace that we are liberated.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Beyond this appearance,
beyond these gods,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.440 align:middle line:84%
beyond phenomena, beyond
to the great mystery god,

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I bow to thee.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.565 align:middle line:90%
I'm in ecstasy.

00:55:01.565 --> 00:55:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a very famous
remark of the Buddha.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Look within.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.470 align:middle line:90%
You are the Buddha.

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Or in the Hindu tradition,
especially from the Rigveda

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.620 align:middle line:90%
to Upanishads, I am Brahma.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Something deep down in me
is identically the same

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.950 align:middle line:90%
as Brahma, the highest reality.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Which is why the call is to
look within rather than looking

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:34.550 align:middle line:84%
outside, because we also need to
remember this remark of Christ.

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:84%
"My kingdom is not
of this world."

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Every level of the universe is
trying to evolve, to come back

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:48.300 align:middle line:90%
to the source, to return home.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a little like a
drop of water separated

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.040 align:middle line:90%
from the whole ocean of being.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And then miraculously,
occasionally there

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:90%
is this connection.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And when it takes place, it's
not going to be my decision.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It has to be from the
other side, which is

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.680 align:middle line:90%
very important to understand.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I need to become more and
more receptive for this ocean

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.970 align:middle line:84%
to take over, but I cannot
demand this to take place.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I can be receptive,
welcoming, inviting.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.860 align:middle line:84%
In my judgment, that's the
whole meaning of prayer.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:33.460 align:middle line:90%
I can welcome God to take over.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>> At a certain point--

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and this applies in all
of our spiritual paths--

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.350 align:middle line:84%
there's a moment to
surrender to the process.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So to listen and be silent is
to make yourself receptive so

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.750 align:middle line:90%
that teachings can come in.

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:52.960 align:middle line:84%
People get this sense
of experience of being

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:90%
not separate, of being one.

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:59.170 align:middle line:84%
They are the one expressing
itself through the many

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.640 align:middle line:90%
or through the individual.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It was gnosis entering that
vast consciousness and laughing

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:13.130 align:middle line:84%
when you realize that you are
the spirits, the mountain,

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.930 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We know it like we've
always known it.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:90%
We remember it.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the great
spiritual mystery?

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.560 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Why have I been created?

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And any answer to that always
remains a great mystery.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.400 align:middle line:84%
We had a very famous poet in
India, Rabindranath Tagore.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So Rabindranath
Tagore wrote a poem

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.780 align:middle line:90%
just 13 days before his death.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:90%
This is his poem.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:41.370 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning of my
life with the first rays

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:46.140 align:middle line:84%
of the rising sun,
I asked, who am I?

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Now at the end of my life with
the last rays of the setting

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:54.390 align:middle line:90%
sun, I ask, who am I?"

We are one as a
