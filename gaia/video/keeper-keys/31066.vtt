Pete is a great

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:90%

The key is to realign with
your original, authentic passion

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and then commit to it, and
don't accept anything that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support the real you.

to see together.

-No.

It's a documentary about seven
keys that can change your life.

to make a better life?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.067 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- ah-- I don't think
I can see that on movie night.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
I'd rather shoot

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
myself in the head with a rubber
bullet than see that movie.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, a negative reaction.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.831 align:middle line:90%
What a surprise.

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:55.065 align:middle line:90%
What's that supposed to mean?

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%

to our relationship,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:90%
you make fun of me.

Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't think

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm alone when I
say there have been

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
countless books and
movies all claiming

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to have the secret to life.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.453 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got "The
Four Contracts,"

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
"The Seven Positive Laws,"
"The Nine Prerogatives."

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.086 align:middle line:84%
You know the guy who wrote
"The Nine Prerogatives" lives

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in a hut on a beach in Kauai?
-Sounds amazing.

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't need all
nine prerogatives.

with three or four.

00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And then years later, a
new edition comes out.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly there's five contracts,
there's eight positive laws.

who bought the first edition?

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:90%

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write my
own self-help book.

It's going to be 750 pages long.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Page one, it's going to say
do what you can then stop.

I'd love to.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing this whole
thing about a formula called

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
e plus r equals o, that
there are events that occur

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
in your life, and then you
have a response to that event,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and then you get an outcome.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And what most people do when
they don't get the outcome

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
they want is they
blame the event.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They blame the government,
the weather, their parents

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
were alcoholics, their boss
is a jerk, whatever it is.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing is that people

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
need to realize that the only
thing that's going to produce

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
a better outcome, more
of what you want in life,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is by changing your response,
because the event's not

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:90%
going to change.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
change our thinking.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to change the
pictures we hold in our head.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
our beliefs, and we

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:90%
have to change our behaviors.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
then we can start

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
producing different outcomes.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:90%
You're used to failing.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's comfortable
to fail for you.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:90%

possible to create a success

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
is that people who
are happiest, people

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
who are living their best
lives, they have one belief,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to ask you to try
this one on for just a minute.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The belief is that we live
in a friendly universe.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said that
the most important

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.155 align:middle line:84%
question you could
ever ask yourself

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:90%
is is this a friendly universe?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
that in fact it is,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is on your side

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
that's happening to you

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is happening actually
for a reason,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
it's happening to support
you, I'm going to ask you

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:90%
to ask yourself this question.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
If this were happening
for a higher purpose,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.393 align:middle line:90%
what would that purpose be?

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to mow the
lawn or pay for date night.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is put here on
this planet for a reason.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident
that you're here.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you're here to
do is uniquely yours,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and it'll look
different than mine.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It'll look different
than everybody else's.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And you know, for a long time, I
thought that all I need in life

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
was to have success
and then I'd be happy.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had
five things I thought

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I needed to be successful.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a great career,
I'll have a wonderful family,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll have loving friends,
I'll have a comfortable home,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have the equivalent
of Halle Berry's body.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got four
out of the five.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't have Halle Berry's
body, but I got a great career,

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
fabulous home, wonderful
partner, great friends,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and healthy body.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I found that at the height
of all of the success in life,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:90%
it still wasn't enough.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I had three books in the "New
York Times" bestseller list.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I had just given a
talk to 8,000 people.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I had signed 5,432 books.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I remember that night
going up to my hotel room.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It was the penthouse suite.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I plopped onto the bed
and I burst out into tears

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
because I realized
that even though I had

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
everything that I
thought I wanted in life,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
I felt an emptiness inside.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
You think that getting
all of these things

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or having all of this
success is what's

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
going to do it, make
you happy inside,

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%
you've got it backwards.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
When you raise your
happiness level,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
when you feel
better inside, when

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:84%
you raise your
energetic vibration,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
you create an entirely
different world around you.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The success that
you want is going

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to come from inside
first, and then

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:90%
the outer world will follow.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you to
do an exercise with me, OK?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, can we.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Too intense.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you how
you can move from the stress

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
response, which is what
you're in right now--

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling pretty stressed
out-- into what science

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:90%
calls the love response.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's three steps.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:90%
First step is very simple.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
You put the palm of your
hand over your heart.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
That simple act
starts the release

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
of a chemical called oxytocin.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is called
the love hormone.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's what helps us feel
more love and bonding

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
but you can feel

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
it yourself just by putting
your hand over your heart area.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:90%
That's step number one.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Here's step number two.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
breathing in and out through
the center of your heart.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Just picture or feel
that your breath

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is coming in and out through
the center of your heart.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And then the third step.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
On each in breath, I
want you to imagine

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.346 align:middle line:90%
that you're breathing in love.

00:16:07.346 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing in ease.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing in compassion.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can exhale
normally, but just

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
inhale, breathing in ease
and love and compassion,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and exhale normally.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, doing this
takes about a minute.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And doing it one time, you
may feel a little bit better

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:90%
But here's the real trick.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Do this three,
four, or five times

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
today, and do this
that way every day

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
for the next couple
weeks, and you

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
will notice that you'll be
more and more in the habit

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:90%
of being in the love response.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:90%
You think, oh, that's so easy.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.285 align:middle line:84%
That couldn't possibly do
anything, but it's powerful.

00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I want you to try
it out every day

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
for the next few weeks,
three, four times a day,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and just see how you feel.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Do it is an experiment and
you'll lift your love response.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So are Jack and
Marci dreaming too?

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's their
essence which they

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:90%
consciously projected outward.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Your inner search has
drawn their energy

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
here to this vortex, which
stands outside of time itself.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
you're talking about, none.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not important
that you understand.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Just know they're
here to help you.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Relationships are ending
every day, and people pick up.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They make their lives
better as a result of it.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:84%
When a relationship ends,
you want to look at how

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
you contributed to it ending.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And how do you know that?

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you're certainly
doing the best you can.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:90%
What did your partner tell you?

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
There's always some truth.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Where there's
smoke, there's fire.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
If she says you're too
negative, you're too negative.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:90%
You need to look at that.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You need to look at how
am I being too negative?

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And you probably feel
you're just being yourself.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, for that person,
you're too negative.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you might
think, well, everybody's

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
going to think
you're too negative,

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to
make some adjustments.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
adjust who you are.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to adjust how you
communicate who you are.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
When you feel angry
inside, you have

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to realize if you express
that anger to someone,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
they'll take it as rejection.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:90%
They may become afraid.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:90%
They may feel abandoned.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
They may be scared.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what reaction
you're having, but if you're

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
getting a negative reaction
to expressing your anger,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:84%
then you need to learn how
to express it in a way that

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:90%
doesn't create that reaction.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
You can be angry, but
how do you communicate

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:90%
how you feel to another person?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
In terms of rebuilding
a relationship,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:90%
there may be no chance.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you've lost trust, it's
often hard to rebuild it.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It does happen, though.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can look and do an
inventory of yourself--

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
how have I contributed to the
problems in this relationship,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
how have I not heard my
partner-- that doesn't

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:90%
mean you're completely wrong.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There's always two
sides to every issue.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
take responsibility

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to attract her back, to
create that relationship,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
or to create a better
relationship in the future,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at how you
communicated what you feel

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and the absence of
your positive feelings.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Look at how to communicate
your positive feelings.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
That's going to draw
the best in another.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
These pictures represent
others in the dream state

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
who wish to interact with you.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL: What do
you mean represent?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.735 align:middle line:90%
ELIZABETH: Take a closer look.

00:19:19.735 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:90%
He looks kind of sensitive.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.492 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you shouldn't scare him.
-OK.

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:28.589 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:29.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:19:29.555 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.925 align:middle line:84%
I'm trapped in a "Harry
Potter" knockoff.

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE]
OK.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's go past the wall
of talking pictures.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm just better one on one.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I was
working 16 hours a day.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I was failing in my business.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, I was missing
all the time with my wife

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and with my children.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is, when
I was spending time with them,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:84%
many years later they
would say to me Dad,

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:90%
do you remember this?

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Dad, do you remember that?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And you said this,
and we said that.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't remember,
because even when I did have

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:90%
time with them, I wasn't there.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:21.727 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't in the room.

00:20:21.727 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhere else
thinking about work

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
or to pay those bills.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the tragedy of
not being your true self.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
When you're your true self, you
can remember all the moments

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and you can have more of them.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
My clients were
running me ragged.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:90%
They were abusing me.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.525 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one night,
I was so tired

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
driving home I
nearly killed myself

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.535 align:middle line:90%
crashing on the motor way.

00:20:38.535 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And after 18 years in
business, I wasn't depressed,

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
but I was clinically unhappy.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Very late one night,
I'm in my office.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about quarter
to 10:00 at night

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the security guard came
into the office to lock up,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and I said, just give
me 10 more minutes.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, Derek, what time
did you get in this morning?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I just said, well,
8:00, 8:00 AM.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.164 align:middle line:84%
And as he walked away, my
words just hung in the air.

00:21:00.164 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hand on the
top of the filing cabinet

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and I slammed the door, and
I said, I just had enough,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and in that moment
is when I changed.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, I set
about setting new standards

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
for the whole of my life.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I made a decision to use
the key of appreciation

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and to look at all
areas of my life

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and set new, higher standards
for all of those areas

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and commit to living
at those high standards

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:90%
from that point onwards.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
In England, I'm known
as the standards guy.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I set really high
standards for myself,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and I stick at those standards.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:84%
How I changed my life was
that I used to set goals.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I set goals for 18 years.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But until that
night in the office,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I was a failure on every level.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
See, this guy makes
sense to me because it's

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%
not some mystical process.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not a five day retreat.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:90%
He just made a decision.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Bang, it's done.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%
That's all it takes.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
When I set standards, my
life changed overnight.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.965 align:middle line:84%
Within three years, I
become a millionaire.

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERING) Millionaire.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
In the following year, I made
$1 million in just that year,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and I did it by
working half the time.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
You can start by
setting standards

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
in all the areas of your life
that you're unhappy with,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
or even angry with, and
decide how you really

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:90%
want to feel in those areas.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And just one day at a time,
just stick at that standard.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:90%
See, it's like a goal.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying do this
for the rest of your life.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Just do it for
today, for one day,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.425 align:middle line:90%
and stick at your standard.

00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I got a piece of paper and I
wrote out my weekly timetable,

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and at the start of
every single day,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.995 align:middle line:84%
it would say dad taking
children to school.

00:22:28.995 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And every day would
finish differently.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And three days a week, it
was dad picking children up

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
from school and have client
time, non-client time,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.107 align:middle line:90%
weekends, and family time.

00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I worked out this
whole week schedule

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and I actually laminated
it, and I gave one

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to each member of the
family, to each child,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to my wife, and the last copy,
I put with a fridge magnet

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
onto the fridge so everyone
would know this is the new dad.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.027 align:middle line:90%
This is his new standards.

00:22:51.027 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
when you set standards

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the people
around you in the world

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
will try and judge you or see
you at your old standards.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And what you have to do
is be patient with them

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and let them know that this is
the new you, the new standards,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and let them catch up
with where you are.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Once I set standards,
I discovered

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and appreciated my true self.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And as my true self, I changed.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.995 align:middle line:84%
And when I changed,
everything changed for me.

00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
That's Derek Mills.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:90%
I love this guy.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
He's so stylish and
perfect, though.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I can
do what he's doing.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I do want to be him in
my next life, though.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) I'm going
to stick at my standards.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.555 align:middle line:84%
Shall we?
Stick at our standards.

00:23:28.555 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:10%
Go on.
Say it five times fast.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.841 align:middle line:10%
I dare you.
-Stick to your standards?

00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:10%
You should stick
to your standards.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.007 align:middle line:10%
But say it fast.
Stick your standards.

00:23:35.007 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Stick to your standards.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Stick to your standards.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Stick to your standards.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Stick to your standards.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Stick to your standards.
-That's all right.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.647 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry I asked.

00:23:41.647 --> 00:23:43.179 align:middle line:84%
-Stick to your standards.
-I got it.

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:84%
OK. (WHISPERING)
What was I thinking?

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.139 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, one the
secrets I've learned

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
for being successful
in life is to come

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:90%
from a place of appreciation.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What I've found is when you
start appreciating what you

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
already have, then you're
creating a vibration

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation and
the universe sends you

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:90%
more to be appreciative for.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:84%
What most people focus on
is what they don't have,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you get more
of what you don't want.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
People talk about I don't
want this to happen.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.009 align:middle line:84%
I wish that wasn't happening.
I don't have this.

00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:09.764 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that.

00:24:09.764 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
getting more of that,

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and if you take what you've
got and start appreciating it,

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
literally life gets
very, very magical.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Just as you want
to be appreciated,

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel when
you're appreciated?

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
You just want to give
more and more and more.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.550 align:middle line:84%
That's how women will feel
when you appreciate them,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and we men are the worst
at appreciating women.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We don't appreciate each other.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:90%
We're competing with each other.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize why we
love women so much is

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that women have that
ability to delight

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:90%
in all the little things we do.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
the ability to be

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
upset about the little
things we don't do.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a given.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize, we, we're
just sort of like cool, calm,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about
it, no big deal,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it's not that,
it's not important.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
In dealing with
a woman, you just

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
have to amp it up
a little bit more

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and point out the little things.
Oh, you did that?

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so glad you did that.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you did this?

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
can't amp it up too

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
much because you're a guy,
what you can do is ask

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:90%
what did she do?

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.125 align:middle line:84%
What did she-- you
know, what's going on?

00:25:07.125 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And she will take
that opportunity

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to tell you all the
things that she did,

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and she'll often be
frustrated about it.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you wonder, OK,
what am I supposed to say?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:90%
This is the magic thing to say.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
You listen.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:90%
You say, really?

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Tell me more.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when she seems
to be done, then you say--

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.420 align:middle line:84%
--you give so much
to so many people.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hug.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.181 align:middle line:84%
And you give her a hug, and
she will feel appreciated.

00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL: Genius.
What was the phrase?

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
You give so much
to so many people.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hug.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Somebody sees me.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody knows what
I'm going through.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes a
woman feel appreciated.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Give it a try.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You give so much love
to so many people.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
instant critique.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.615 align:middle line:84%
Well, you got to put a
little more feeling into it.

00:26:03.615 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
You give so much
to so many people.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.064 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hug.

00:26:07.064 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
-Say it like you really mean it.
-OK.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
All right.
Jeez.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Tone of voice is everything.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.202 align:middle line:84%
You give so much
to so many people.

00:26:16.202 --> 00:26:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you a hug.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Simple phrases, I love you.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize what
a difference it makes.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Just before my 30th
birthday, I found myself going

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%
through a major depression.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at all my friends.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:90%
They were married.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:90%
They drove nice cars.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:90%
They lived in beautiful houses.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:90%
They had adorable kids.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.915 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective, it
looked like they had it all.

00:26:37.915 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I, on the other hand,
was in a relationship

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
that was going nowhere.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I was renting a
house, leasing a car.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.294 align:middle line:84%
I was living with my four cats.
-Four cats.

00:26:46.294 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I like the four cats part.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get four cats.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I have no job, no home, no
income, but I have four cats.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.850 align:middle line:90%
What a babe magnet.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to name them
Harmony, Courage, Faith,

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and Cheerios for the last one.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.855 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Just so everyone can ask
what's up with Cheerios?

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.065 align:middle line:84%
Then I came home
from work one day,

00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting on the
sofa reading a great book,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
picking through a box
of imported chocolates,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and I started thinking about
the things that I did have

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and that I didn't have
the heavy responsibilities

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that all my friends had.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I could do whatever I wanted
to whenever I wanted to do it.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
By writing down the
things that I did have,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the universe started to
provide for me in ways that I

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
could not have even imagined.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm married to
the love of my life

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and it just keeps
getting better.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy to
practice gratitude

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
when everything's going
really well in your life.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
You just received a new job,
you met the love of your life.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The challenge comes when
things are not going so well.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I have gotten in the habit of
a daily practice of gratitude

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
for the last several years,
and it has really helped me

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
recently as my father suffered
a stroke, one on the left side

00:27:54.910 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of his brain, that has affected
his ability to talk, and think,

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and reason.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And to look at a situation
like that with a father

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
that I absolutely
adore and watching

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:84%
him go through the pain and
frustration of knowing what he

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:84%
wants to say and not
being able to communicate

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:90%
it is heartbreaking.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I challenge myself
to find gratitude even

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:90%
within these circumstances.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Even though my father
does not have command

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
of his entire language,
there are a couple

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:84%
of phrases that he says
over and over again

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:90%
every day I go to visit him.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And he says thank you every
day I go to visit him.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I just want to let
you know how much I love you.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Every day, he shares
his love with me.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Any time anything tragic
happens in a person's life,

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:84%
something good always
comes out of it.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The key to creating harmony
in your relationships

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is always taking
that first step.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
How did I contribute
to this problem?

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And generally speaking, how
anyone contributes to a problem

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is lack of understanding
what the other person's

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:90%
going through.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And as a man, the
most important thing

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that you're missing
in this relationship

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:90%
is you don't feel appreciated.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel acknowledged.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the bottom line for every
man, because we're out there,

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.810 align:middle line:84%
we're struggling,
we're doing what

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
we think is the right thing.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And then we come home, and
she's got a list of problems.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, how can you
focus on all those problems

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:90%
when look what I've just done.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, give me a break.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate me for
what I've done.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be appreciated
in a relationship,

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to help
her appreciate you.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I've got to help
her appreciate me?

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.722 align:middle line:90%
I should just be appreciated.

00:30:05.722 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And what men don't realize is
that we think if I do something

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
big, I should get a whole
lot of appreciation,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and if I do something
little, I should

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:90%
get just a little appreciation.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But the way women operate
is if you give them

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
a little gift of love
or a big gift of love,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.720 align:middle line:90%
it has the same effect.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you're working
really, really hard,

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:90%
that's one point in her world.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.681 align:middle line:90%
One point.

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:90%
One point I get for working.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:84%
If you do one rose,
that's one point.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If you give 24 roses, you're
thinking that's 24 points.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:90%
But really, it's just one point.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So men are always thinking I
give so much, I give so much.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And look at this, she feels
like she doesn't appreciate me.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What are those little one roses
that you're missing out on?

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:84%
If you listen a little bit
longer and ask what else,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.460 align:middle line:84%
what else when she's talking,
each time you say what else,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:90%
you get another point.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You come home and you give her
a hug, you get another point.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You look her in the eyes and
give her a compliment, oh

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
my gosh, you've got two points.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
You looked at her and you
gave her a compliment.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
You plan a date six
days in advance--

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.929 align:middle line:90%
Six days in advance?

00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:09.695 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to know what
I want to do in six days?

00:31:09.695 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of waiting till
Friday night to say, hey,

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:84%
what do you want to
do tonight, and you're

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
both tired and exhausted, you
decide to stay home and watch

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:90%
TV, you get no points.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But a week in advance
you say, hey, let's

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:90%
go out on a date next weekend.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.450 align:middle line:90%
How about this or this or this?

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And she says, oh, this.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And you go great, let's do that.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
She'll be telling all her
friends, oh, I'm going to see

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:90%
this concert with my husband.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Every time she brags about
you, you get a point.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.685 align:middle line:84%
Wait, I get a point?
I like points.

00:31:33.685 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I get a point?
-Mm-hmm.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's three or
four points every day.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
You're cashing in the
points and you think, hey,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I should be getting all
the points because I'm

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:90%
working really hard.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Working hard is good,
but it's just one point.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Hey, can I apply for credit?

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
For all that you've
done in the past,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
those efforts will
be appreciated

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
if you can come back and start
focusing on the little things

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and let her know
that you ignored

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
her, that you
neglected her, that you

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:90%
forgot to do those things.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:90%
You forgot what was important.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you let her know
that you lost your way,

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:84%
her heart starts
to open and then

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
she also starts to remember
all that you've done.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get that credit,
but to keep her heart open,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
it's the little
things that count.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to play a game?

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't really like games.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Here's $1,000.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, let's play.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Every time you voice
a negative thought,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to give
me back $100 bill.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the game?

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the game.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:84%
That's-- sounds like a
wonderful and exciting

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:90%
game filled with festivity.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:90%
So can I ask you something?

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole people talking
in the pictures thing,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
is that to test me?

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.931 align:middle line:84%
-Is it to test you?
-Come on.

00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me.
Is that a test?

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:90%
You think so?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.619 align:middle line:84%
I'm already
moderately skeptical

00:32:48.619 --> 00:32:49.952 align:middle line:84%
about the whole subject
matter, and then

00:32:49.952 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
with the whole low rent
"Harry Potter" delivery,

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
it's just bugging me.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is it bugging you?

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to answer every
question with a question?

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.992 align:middle line:90%
Am I?

00:32:58.992 --> 00:33:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hell.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.268 align:middle line:84%
Somebody wake me up.
Somebody--

00:33:03.268 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I started developing a
technique called Aqua Motion

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:84%
where I would do body work along
with the floating in the water

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to relieve any aches and pains.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
In today's society, we
don't get touched enough.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:90%
We hardly ever get touched.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
even like to be touched

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:90%
or to touch others.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's been proven
through studies that we

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:90%
can die from the lack of touch.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I got to-- I got to
ask you something.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.771 align:middle line:84%
Is what she's
talking about legal?

00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.567 align:middle line:84%
There's no funds
exchanged of any kind?

00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:50.968 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:50.968 --> 00:33:53.303 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:53.303 --> 00:33:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking something bad.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.847 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, we just had
to discuss something.

00:34:01.847 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: Kathleen,
would you please

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.841 align:middle line:84%
share how your journey began?
-Sure.

00:34:04.841 --> 00:34:06.539 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: I think it'll help.
-Yeah.

00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:84%
Water therapy is where people
who cannot tolerate dry

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.090 align:middle line:90%
land therapy go into the pool.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
So there was one
lady who came to me,

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and she was a massage
therapist as well

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:84%
but had never had massage
work done in the water.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Her husband, who had been
affected and depressed

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.570 align:middle line:84%
by the downturn of the economy,
decided to take his own life.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then just several months
later, one of her sisters

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.770 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with cancer
and died shortly thereafter.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:84%
I could see those
emotional things

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:90%
being released into the water.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a sense of
calmness that came over her.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see
it in their bodies,

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
the way they start
off stiffly and then

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:90%
start to move like in a dance.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we emerged
from the water,

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:54.100 align:middle line:84%
she was sobbing uncontrollably
and did for several minutes

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
until she could
regain her composure.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I received a letter from
her a few days later stating

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that her husband and her sister
had come to her to let her know

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that they were fine
and that they wanted

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.870 align:middle line:90%
her to move on with her life.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So she said that
at that session,

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:84%
her emotional traumas had
been completely released

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and she felt like she could
move forward for the first time

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:90%
in several years.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
We never know from time
to time, from session

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to session, what will happen.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But just being touched
is so important,

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and being in a
space where you can

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
allow your emotions
to completely let go,

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
it's a sacred space.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration of the water
just heals on all levels.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Michael, when your
reality is not the reality

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:84%
you want to experience,
whether at home,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
at work, in your
relationships, you

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:84%
can begin to change that reality
by changing your language.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Really think before you speak.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I would even say think
about what you're thinking.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.525 align:middle line:90%
Think before you think.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Think before you speak.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Think before you act.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done that since 1985.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.869 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: And where
has that gotten you?

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:11.184 align:middle line:90%
Loserville.

00:36:11.184 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Improving the
dialogue you have with

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
yourself will change
your reality in ways

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:90%
that you cannot now imagine.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:84%
For the last 15 years of
my grandmother's life,

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:90%
she suffered from dementia.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
For the first three
of those 15 years,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather was able
to take care of her.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:84%
He would take her into the homes
where he would tune pianos,

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and she would sit there
quietly, watching and listening.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But then her condition
progressively got worse.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
She became combative.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:84%
She resisted every effort
that my grandfather

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:90%
made to take care of her.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.650 align:middle line:90%
She began to run away from him.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking
with my grandfather

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:84%
as he wrestled with the decision
to put her in a nursing home.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:90%
He anguished over that.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But I also realized
that wasn't just

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:90%
anguishing over that decision.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It was because he was being
confronted with the brevity

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of life and the realization
that all good things

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.330 align:middle line:84%
must come to an end, even a
great marriage of 68 years.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
He cried as he said, it's
all over too quick, Ken.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.820 align:middle line:84%
For the next 12 years, he
made the round trip, 20 miles,

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:90%
to visit Grandma every day.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Grandma eventually forgot
everything from her past.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:90%
She forgot how to speak.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:90%
She forgot my mother.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:90%
She forgot me.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:84%
She forgot Grandpa, but
Grandpa did not forget her.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I overheard one day
someone ask him,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
why do you go see your
wife every single day?

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:84%
She's not the same
woman she once was.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.106 align:middle line:84%
Why, she doesn't even
know who you are.

00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And Grandpa said, that's true.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know who I am.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:90%
But I know who I am.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm the same man who
68 years ago told her

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that I would love
her, honor her,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and keep her in sickness and in
health till death do us part.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I love her more now than
I did when I said I do.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, in order
to be successful,

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.551 align:middle line:84%
you have to find out
something that lights you up,

00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
something that gives
you excitement,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.905 align:middle line:84%
that makes you want to get
out of bed in the morning.

00:38:13.905 --> 00:38:15.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
was younger, someone

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
had me sit down and write a
list of 20 things I love to do,

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and it was a broad list.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I loved to go to war movies.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I loved to open my mail.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I loved to solve problems.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I loved to have high
level conversations.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I loved to make a
difference in the world.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, find
a way to make money

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.990 align:middle line:90%
doing that which you love.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine is a surfer.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The woman who surfs,
she loves surfing.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So how do you make
money surfing?

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.630 align:middle line:84%
She takes women executives on
her boat in Hawaii for a week

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and she teaches
them how to surf,

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and what she notices is
whatever that shows up

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in their fear of
approaching surfing

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
or how they approach it
is the same thing that

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:84%
shows up in the boardroom
and in their offices.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.295 align:middle line:84%
And she charges like
$5,000 or $10,000 a person,

00:38:53.295 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and she makes $50,000 or $60,000
a month doing what she loves.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So Michael, find out
what it is you love

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to do and then ask
yourself, how could I

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:90%
make a living doing that?

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And you may have to
experiment with a number

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
of different things, but if
you stick with it long enough,

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a way to live
your life with passion.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Friend of mine said, when your
vocation feels like a vacation,

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you have arrived, and that's
possible for everybody.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.431 align:middle line:84%
So you're familiar
with Jack's work?

00:39:17.431 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Anne loves his "Chicken
Soup for the Soul" series.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
She's read, like,
nine of his books.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.594 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream that
Jack Canfield and I were

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.270 align:middle line:90%
working on a book together.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Chicken Soup
for the Jaded Old Bastard."

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So the key to
living your passion

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.810 align:middle line:84%
is to be completely
open to following what

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.911 align:middle line:84%
your heart tells you to do that
is uniquely yours on the planet

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.360 align:middle line:84%
All right, but what if my heart
tells me to lay on the couch,

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.780 align:middle line:84%
eat a lot of bad
junk food, and watch

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.404 align:middle line:90%
reruns of "Sanford and Son"?

00:39:46.404 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:90%
You ever seen "Sanford and Son"?

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's funny, really funny.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is actually not
telling you to lay on the couch

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and eat a whole bunch of bad
food and watch bad movies.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:90%
That is probably from your fear.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.910 align:middle line:84%
If you were to go deeper and
really say, OK, what am I here

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
for, your heart would tell you
something completely different.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's your heart
when you feel inspired by it,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
when it opens you up,
when you feel expanded.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I love seeing what I
can accomplish and know

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that I can do anything because
I have such strong passion

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:90%
for everything that I do.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.780 align:middle line:84%
At 10, I became a
level 10 gymnast.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
At 13, I had published
my second book.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:84%
At 16, I graduated valedictorian
from my high school class.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was 18,
I had three books published

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and was hosting my
own television show.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I have more cable channels
than anybody on my block.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a great accomplishment.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.590 align:middle line:84%
An outsider may look
at my accomplishments

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and say that I must have
a lot of discipline.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Discipline often comes
with the connotation

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.280 align:middle line:90%
of making a lot of sacrifices.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.582 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
someone who merely acts out

00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of discipline and someone
who owns the key to passion

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.760 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're
engaged in your passion,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:84%
the joy of self expression is
brought to a whole new level.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:84%
This is why when you're
engaged in your passion,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.740 align:middle line:84%
it's often called
the labor of love.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:90%
There's the labor part.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you love
what you're doing,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:90%
it hardly feels like work.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Michael, Raven said she felt
she was put on this Earth

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to do great things.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever feel like you
were put on this Earth

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.316 align:middle line:90%
to do great things?

00:41:19.316 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Hmm.
Yeah, no.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.466 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:41:23.466 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:90%
No, sorry.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I love Napoleon Hill.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
He once said, no one
is richer than those

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:84%
who have found
their labor of love

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and are busily engaged
in performing it.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest form of
our expression of desire.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the forerunner
of all human progress.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, my life
has often felt

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:84%
like an 18 wheeler going
downhill through the mountains

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:90%
without any breaks.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I've created,
closed, and currently

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.650 align:middle line:90%
operate multiple businesses.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been on the
brink of foreclosure

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.755 align:middle line:90%
not once, but twice.

00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So by 2008, life was
going really well.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Business was great, kids
were getting so big, the wife

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and I had just
celebrated 11 plus years.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I got the
call, and it was my mom.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:84%
She told me that my
stepfather, who had raised

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:90%
me since I was 10, lay dying.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I went there immediately.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The illness that had
consumed his body for years

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.800 align:middle line:90%
had finally taken its toll.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And as I held his hand,
I had a profound vision

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:26.440 align:middle line:84%
that really shook me to my core,
a vision of my own funeral.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I lay in the casket,
I could hear the words

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.540 align:middle line:90%
being spoken graveside.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Here lies Steve Olsher.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.630 align:middle line:10%
He dedicated his life to
chasing the almighty dollar.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that was said.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly feel
like my stepfather

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.020 align:middle line:84%
spoke to me through that
physical connection,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:90%
holding his hand.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
He was saying to me, this
is your inevitable fate

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:90%
if you do not change course.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was imploring me
to do something about it.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately began
to reinvent my life.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I had to rid myself
of the anchors

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:05.410 align:middle line:84%
that were dragging me down, both
the people and the activities.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
I really had

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:90%
to honor who I inherently am.

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.880 align:middle line:84%
See, I believe that
we each have one very

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.330 align:middle line:84%
specific powerful gift to share,
and I call that gift your what.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.885 align:middle line:84%
So the question I have for
you is what is your what?

00:43:20.885 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:90%
What is my what what?

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
-What is My what?
-What?

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.358 align:middle line:90%
What is your what?

00:43:24.358 --> 00:43:25.194 align:middle line:90%
What is my what what?

00:43:25.194 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:90%
What is your what?

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What is the one thing that
your soul is compelled to do?

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:84%
The one thing you
were meant to do.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And once you can answer
that question, I promise you,

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
everything else will
fall into place.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin pursuing
your what with reckless abandon,

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing what happens.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Things that used to bother you
will carry a lot less weight.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll be fired up to jump
out of bed every morning,

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and there just won't be
enough hours in the day

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish your objectives.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:84%
There's really only
two types of people--

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
those who meander through life
and never really get to where

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:84%
they were predestined
to go, and those who

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:90%
choose to live their passion.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And choosing to live a
life filled with passion

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:84%
is your key to shifting from
being awake to being alive.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:84%
At those times in our life
when nothing is coming together,

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.390 align:middle line:84%
where we're scared,
where we're sad,

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling very much alone,
no one understands what we're

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.900 align:middle line:84%
going through,
during these times,

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:84%
it seems to take all our energy,
all our will, just to survive.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Amen, sister.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.790 align:middle line:84%
At this point, a
better quality of life

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:90%
seems next to impossible.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Yet, if we could focus even
the smallest amount of energy

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and intention on what it
is that we really want,

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:84%
we'll begin to recognize
that the key to living

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that fulfilling life
is by connecting

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:90%
and engaging with our passion.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It takes being
willing to acknowledge

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that we want something
better and expressing it

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:57.910 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I want something better.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a good start.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.902 align:middle line:90%
I want something better.

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:05.706 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:90%
That's all I got to do?

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I want something.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm fed up, and I
want something better.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL: Am I taking the advice?

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.814 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing it right?

00:45:13.814 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:90%
ELIZABETH: You're getting there.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I want something better.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Really good.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:24.481 align:middle line:84%
I'm mad as hell, and I
want something better.

00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Felt sort of Chayefsky
there, didn't I?

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I speak about doing
what it takes and passion

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.320 align:middle line:90%
from my own experience.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I was the youngest
woman in the '80s

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to buy a seat on the American
Stock Exchange and build a firm

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:37.550 align:middle line:90%
and go global.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, a
clerk made a mistake,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and everything I built up
came unraveled in a moment.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could
have so easily gotten

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.210 align:middle line:90%
caught in the blame game.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I focused my
attention, my energy,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:84%
on what it was that I
wanted, and I went to work

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and I rebuilt everything.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.440 align:middle line:10%
10 years later, I lived on
Wall Street, had an office

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.100 align:middle line:10%
in the World Trade Center.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the tragedy of
September 11th occurred.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a standing appointment
on Tuesday mornings

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.870 align:middle line:84%
in my office at
the Trade Center.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And Monday September 10,
at 4:30 in the afternoon,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:90%
that appointment was canceled.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.080 align:middle line:10%
I went in early,
dropped my stuff,

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and headed to the Upper
West Side of Manhattan.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:10%
For so many people, if you
were doing what you were doing

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.630 align:middle line:10%
and didn't have
access to TV or radio

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:10%
or were just in a room with
people, you had no idea.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.600 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have any idea.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I left to go, and the
person I'd been meeting with

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
came running out after
me and said something

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:90%
had happened downtown.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Challenges do make us stronger
and then help us to grow.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.680 align:middle line:84%
When the economy was
hit, so many people

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.640 align:middle line:90%
went through such tough times.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I was no exception.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Yet my passion to live a
quality life and to be happy

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.550 align:middle line:84%
was a key for me to be
appreciative, to be happy.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.880 align:middle line:84%
If you want more out
of life and you're not

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.010 align:middle line:84%
willing to give yourself
permission to go for what

00:46:55.010 --> 00:47:00.290 align:middle line:90%
you want, then pause, stop.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Go outside.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Check out a sunrise or
look up at the stars.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Take 20 minutes and
watch some children play.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Talk to someone 20, 30
years older than you

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and ask them what they would do
if they were suddenly your age.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Pausing to take in
the world around us

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:84%
can really give us
a fresh perspective.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful reminder that
the time to begin is now.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.870 align:middle line:90%
The time to act is right now.

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:28.290 align:middle line:84%
It takes courage to
connect with our passion,

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and our passion actually
fuels our courage.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Even though it might not be
recognizable at the time,

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:84%
we do what we need to
do because we love life.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.560 align:middle line:90%
We want a quality of life.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
A part of us never
wants to settle.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Yet that often seems easier.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, it
takes a lot of energy

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:90%
to suffer and not be happy.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Choose to engage
with your passion.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Choose today.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Choose now to live your
best life in this lifetime.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I promise, you have the
resources and the capacity

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.782 align:middle line:90%
to have it be.

00:47:59.782 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:84%
There's really two levels
of faith as I see it.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
faith in yourself,

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have faith
in the universe, source, God,

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:17.620 align:middle line:84%
however you call that, because
you have to act as if you

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.190 align:middle line:90%
can do what you want to do.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's born
with the talents

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that they need to fulfill
the dreams that they have.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
You cannot dream a dream
that you don't have

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:90%
the capacity to fulfill.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be
allowed to experience

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.290 align:middle line:90%
that dream inside of yourself.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no special
people on the planet.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's born with the
same kinds of talents.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Different talents,
but we all have them.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
that and act as if

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and lean into that, what
you're going to find

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is that this will
start to show up.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing is to believe

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that if you take the
first step toward that,

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.024 align:middle line:84%
the universe is going to
take a step back to you.

00:48:51.024 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Or You can have the faith that
there's going to be support,

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that opportunities and resources
will appear in your path,

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.450 align:middle line:90%
but only when you start to move.

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have to
take an action to get

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.920 align:middle line:90%
feedback from the universe.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to take an
action to be supported.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The universe can't support
what it doesn't see happening,

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.010 align:middle line:84%
so you've got to take
that first step in faith.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The secret to having
faith is to recognize

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.210 align:middle line:84%
you are responsible
for creating your life.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:19.650 align:middle line:84%
As long as you depend on others
to create your life, then

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.650 align:middle line:90%
you're not believing.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You're not believing in
yourself and in your power

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to create what you want.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:84%
The key of faith
lies in believing

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in the people around us.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.530 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
in eighth grade,

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I was really
interested in horses.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Picture me, young
teenager, typical teenager.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But I had all these tutors to
help me get through school.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I had braces on my
teeth for five years.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.950 align:middle line:90%
I mistrusted myself.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who I was.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I challenged
everything that I did,

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and I was pretty frustrated.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.200 align:middle line:84%
One day, my dad brought
home a picture, a portrait

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of a beautiful horse, and
he hung it on my wall,

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and then he turned
to me and he said,

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.390 align:middle line:90%
this was a very small horse.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:90%
He had bad knees.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Nobody thought he
could ever win a race.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:90%
But his trainer did.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.080 align:middle line:90%
His trainer believed in him.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:09.865 align:middle line:84%
And Seabiscuit won the
greatest race ever.

00:50:09.865 --> 00:50:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Carolyn,
that happened the year

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:13.090 align:middle line:90%
you were born.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:17.600 align:middle line:84%
If a horse can overcome his
challenges, you can too.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That day, my dad gave
me the key to faith

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:84%
because he shared with me
that he truly believed in me,

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.325 align:middle line:90%
and I never lost it.

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I love that
movie, "Seabiscuit."

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous, horse.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous movie.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:33.502 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:33.502 --> 00:50:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Just because a horse is
broken down a little bit

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:38.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you put
him out to pasture.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Chris Cooper won the
Oscar with that one line.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:90%
But think about the message.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Just because you're
broken down a little bit

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.000 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it's over.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Why are you looking at
me when you say that?

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
My family was on vacation in
Lake Chautauqua in New York

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.860 align:middle line:84%
State, and we are all
around the television

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:84%
watching our little black and
white TV of the moon landing.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And my thoughts just went
to, I want to do that.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.975 align:middle line:84%
And I applied for the NASA
teacher in space program.

00:51:06.975 --> 00:51:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear
that there would

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:11.420 align:middle line:84%
be one teacher, one
teacher that would

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.370 align:middle line:90%
be invited to go into space.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.995 align:middle line:84%
It was a long, written
essay application,

00:51:17.995 --> 00:51:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and I made it through
the first cut,

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and then waited for
the second round

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and made it through
the second cut.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.920 align:middle line:84%
After the second cut,
it just confirmed

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.920 align:middle line:90%
for me that this was my path.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So when I failed to
make the third cut,

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I was sure that NASA
and divine intelligence

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:90%
had made huge mistakes.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:84%
About a year later, I remember
watching the Challenger launch

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.370 align:middle line:84%
with my students and other
teachers, this space shuttle

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that carried Christa McAuliffe,
the sacred vessel that was

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.085 align:middle line:90%
going to carry her into space.

00:51:52.085 --> 00:51:54.600 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:10%
When we watched and we
noticed that something

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.880 align:middle line:10%
was going terribly wrong,

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.240 align:middle line:10%
I remember just my
legs became weak.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle line:10%
This could not be happening.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting how we
work to manifest things

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're so sure that
we control our destiny.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there's this partnership
with infinite intelligence

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that I found important
to put into place.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Without this partnership,
we're sort of this vessel

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.570 align:middle line:90%
that's floating on the sea.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say this was a
pivotal point for me.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
This was a point at which I
faced this thing called faith.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.650 align:middle line:84%
In my culture, sons were
favored over daughters.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So when I was born,
my parents were

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
excited to have
their first child,

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and they were also disappointed
that I wasn't a boy.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:10%
I have two younger
sisters and no brothers,

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:10%
so my dad always calls me his
substitute son, and I hated it,

00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:01.230 align:middle line:10%
I hated it with passion, because
it just meant that I wasn't

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:04.200 align:middle line:10%
good enough for him, and I
would never be good enough

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.640 align:middle line:10%
for him because I wasn't a son.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Now my mom, on the
other hand, told me

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that for a girl to be happy,
she must find a good husband.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
A girl must be
beautiful, she said,

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.610 align:middle line:84%
or she has to come
from a rich family,

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:22.350 align:middle line:90%
or she has a great education.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Then she looked at me and said,
Hueina, you are not pretty

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and we are not rich, so
you better study hard.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I became an overachiever,
people pleaser, perfectionist,

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and excelled in
everything I did.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how
much I achieved,

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I never felt good enough.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.980 align:middle line:84%
My relationships with men was
one disaster after another

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.400 align:middle line:84%
until I made one decision
that saved my life.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s, and I just
move from Asia to the US

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.960 align:middle line:84%
far away from all my
friends and family.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I had dated three men in
a row who cheated on me

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.360 align:middle line:90%
and I completely fell apart.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I was so stressed out,
depressed, and suicidal

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:11.710 align:middle line:90%
until one morning, I woke up.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really woke
up, and I got angry.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Those men were not
worthy of my love,

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I
deserve so much more.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I made one decision
that morning.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:31.530 align:middle line:84%
If nobody in the world would
love me, I would love myself.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:84%
If I couldn't fit in
or blend in anywhere,

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I would stand out and be myself.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:41.830 align:middle line:84%
If I were to have a chance
at success with happiness,

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I must learn to believe in
myself and do it my way.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That one decision
changed everything.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.460 align:middle line:10%
I finally realized that my
parents, even though they

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.170 align:middle line:10%
didn't love me the way I
wanted them to love me,

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.900 align:middle line:10%
they were doing their best.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that whatever
happened in my life was just

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:08.200 align:middle line:84%
training me to become
who I'm meant to be,

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and I actually learned to
be grateful for my parents.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I say that in my book
too, and I wrote that it's

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.190 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to my parents.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I am who I
am today because of you,

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:21.920 align:middle line:90%
and I meant that.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.160 align:middle line:84%
If I could go back in time
and talk to my younger self,

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I would say to her that you are
already perfect just the way

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you are, even though
you might feel

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that you are different
from everybody else,

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:39.390 align:middle line:84%
you are beautiful and
powerful, and don't let anybody

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:90%
else tell you otherwise.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
compare yourself.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
compete with others.

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.440 align:middle line:90%
No apologies.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Just you, whatever you want.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:56:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, the greatest skill
you can learn in terms of being

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.550 align:middle line:84%
successful is to learn to manage
your internal emotional states.

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And by that, we mean
creating a vibrational field.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We talk about love,
we talk about harmony,

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.930 align:middle line:84%
we talk about gratitude
and appreciation, joy.

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You can actually generate
those states internally.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.100 align:middle line:84%
There are skills that
you can learn to do that.

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn to do
that, what's going to happen

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is you won't be dependent on
other people outside of you

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.100 align:middle line:90%
to feel good.

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to generate
your feel good inside of you.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:33.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything in
the universe is energy,

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and love is the highest
energetic vibration

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.430 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The reason that we all feel
so good when we fall in love

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is because it's uplifting us.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing us to this other
energy vibration of love.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But the real key is
to actually experience

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.830 align:middle line:90%
that love from inside first.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're raising what I
call your love set point.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you've got
a certain ceiling,

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's the love
you're familiar with.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.570 align:middle line:84%
What we can do, though, is we
can show you how you can raise

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.920 align:middle line:84%
your energetic vibration so that
you're carrying around a higher

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.320 align:middle line:84%
love set point, and then
you feel more love inside

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and you draw more
love to you from that.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:11.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis
of creating greater

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.560 align:middle line:90%
harmony in every relationship.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Negative emotions and
positive emotions both

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:19.450 align:middle line:84%
create a vibration, and
we can become addicted

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:22.175 align:middle line:84%
to the vibration
of those emotions,

00:57:22.175 --> 00:57:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and I know this because
it happened to me.

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:27.960 align:middle line:84%
My son John died
of a drug overdose

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.190 align:middle line:84%
just shortly after
a head injury.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.830 align:middle line:84%
He was a beautiful musician,
very, very talented.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It was the most important
thing in his life.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And after he died, I
was able to pretend

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.600 align:middle line:90%
that life was perfectly normal.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I got up every day, showed
up at work, and functioned,

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.230 align:middle line:90%
but the truth is that I was not.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I used every opportunity that
I could find to be alone,

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.480 align:middle line:90%
to cry, and to grieve.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I would start in the morning.

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I would drive my
grandchildren to school

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:01.420 align:middle line:84%
so that I could be alone
for 40 minutes in the car

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and listen to his music.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end of the day,
I would go on the boat,

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:08.590 align:middle line:84%
but then it was OK for me to
have a glass of wine and cry.

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But what nobody knew
was that I would

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:14.240 align:middle line:84%
go to my office every day,
and I would close the door,

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and I would open up all
the DVDs of John's life.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I would put them into the
computer one after another,

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:26.190 align:middle line:84%
day after day, and sit
there alone secretly crying.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:29.030 align:middle line:90%
One day, I started my ritual.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I put the DVD in.

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:32.610 align:middle line:90%
First one, didn't work.

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Second one, didn't work.

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I went all the way through
to about the 15th DVD

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.700 align:middle line:90%
thinking something has to work.

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.180 align:middle line:90%
This can't be true.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.680 align:middle line:90%
All these videos can't not work.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I put
the last one in.

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now on this video, there happens
to be a clip of John practicing

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:55.590 align:middle line:84%
for a talent contest
with his sister Michelle,

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and they absolutely
hated when I filmed them.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:01.940 align:middle line:84%
When John saw me at the
top of the stairs filming,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:84%
he looked up and he screamed,
Mom, turn the damn thing off.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I put
that last video in,

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.660 align:middle line:84%
it didn't start
at the beginning.

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It went right to that one line--
Mom, turn the damn thing off.

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, I took it out, I
cleaned it, I put it back in.

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Mom, turn the damn thing off.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.870 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:25.770 align:middle line:84%
That's like "Paranormal
Activity" right there.

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:30.320 align:middle line:84%
On about the fifth time,
it was an awakening for me.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.060 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to
get through to tell

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.570 align:middle line:84%
me that I was so
addicted to grieving him

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to stop.

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.960 align:middle line:90%
This was my awakening.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I made a decision
right there right then

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to stop watching his videos.

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.880 align:middle line:84%
By doing that, it
allowed the space

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.160 align:middle line:84%
for me to become accepting
of what happened in life.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.670 align:middle line:84%
John was my teacher
from the moment

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.560 align:middle line:84%
he was born because they
took him away from me

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and they put him
in an incubator.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He was tied down naked
and under a sun lamp

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.110 align:middle line:90%
because of a liver problem.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.110 align:middle line:84%
For almost 12 days,
I was unable to have

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.310 align:middle line:84%
any eye contact with him at
all because of the blindfold.

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:15.840 align:middle line:84%
He was unable to feel my
touch, to hear my voice,

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or even feel the heartbeat
that all babies get to feel.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
When I brought him home, he
was a really difficult child.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that what happened
to him in the incubator

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.350 align:middle line:84%
may have had something
to do with that.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But when he was 11, I let
him have guitar lessons,

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that the
vibrations from the strings

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.380 align:middle line:90%
calmed him down.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
From that moment on, he had a
guitar, a mandolin, or ukulele

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.460 align:middle line:90%
in his hand all the time.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
That early birth trauma
can cause a lot of problems

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.820 align:middle line:90%
emotionally for children.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Vibration can really help that.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I teamed up with an expert
in the field of vibration

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and a behavioral psychologist,
and we created something

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
called Project Heartbeat

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
These are musical prescriptions
that include the mother's

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
heartbeat and the
sound of her voice

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that can be placed in an iPod
and put into an incubator.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
This way, when the child is
taken away from the mother,

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it's never separated from her
vibration, from her voice,

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
or from her heartbeat.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.380 align:middle line:10%
Although John's
life was cut short,

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.930 align:middle line:10%
I understood his purpose,
and his purpose gave

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.608 align:middle line:10%
me the courage to fulfill mine.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%


01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
A banker client of
mine got caught right

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.730 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the recession.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
The stock market plummeted,
and many of his clients

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
lost significant
amounts of money.

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:45.310 align:middle line:10%
And while he still had a job,
he lost a lot of sleepless

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.510 align:middle line:10%
nights like so many
of his colleagues

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:48.700 align:middle line:10%
worried about losing it.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
The reduced paycheck
along with the strain

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of losing other people's money
also affected his marriage.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
His wife was ready to walk
and his kids were avoiding him

01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
as he became increasingly
moody and depressed,

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and he desperately tried
to avoid that little voice

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
inside that said somehow,
he may have participated

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:07.200 align:middle line:90%
in creating this situation.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.340 align:middle line:84%
First, he learned
how to meditate,

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
which enabled them to
remain emotionally centered,

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
sleep better, and even open
up to some of his clients.

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Meditation also strengthened
his thought force

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
by aligning his thoughts with
the powerful laws of nature,

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and life began to flow a little.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Second, he stopped complaining,
and this immediately

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
elevated the depressed
vibrations that he

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.480 align:middle line:90%
was putting out into the world.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.407 align:middle line:90%
And third, he took action.

01:02:32.407 --> 01:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just
sitting around being

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
at the mercy of the market,
he outlined a six point plan

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that every one of his investors
could follow to protect

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and grow their wealth regardless
of what happened in the stock

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.690 align:middle line:90%
market over the short term.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, less than three
years later, he's the number

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
one wealth manager at the bank.

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
He's making more money than
he ever dreamed of for both

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
himself and his clients.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
He bought $1 million
home for $650,000,

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:57.825 align:middle line:84%
and his wife and
kids are thrilled

01:02:57.825 --> 01:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
to have Dad back again.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I think many people experience
this dark night of the soul

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.370 align:middle line:90%
at some point in their lives.

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny,
when you hit bottom,

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
often there's a small voice
waiting for you that says,

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
hey, there's nowhere
to go from here but up.

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It's at that point, if we accept
100% personal responsibility,

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
not only for how we
got into the situation

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
but how we're going to get out,
that we have the opportunity

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to break through those
self-imposed limitations

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate any of our
negative core beliefs.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
You see, we don't
attract into our life

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that which we think
about all the time,

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
but rather, life is
constantly reflecting

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.490 align:middle line:84%
back to us the
vibrations that we're

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:35.340 align:middle line:90%
putting out into the universe.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
When you get in touch
with your true nature

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and then align your actions
with the essence of who you are

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
at the core of your
very being, then you

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
start to see results
in your life,

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and you find out where true
transformation comes from.

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you can make the conscious
s decision to participate

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.390 align:middle line:90%
in designing your own destiny.

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I just lost my job and my girl.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
You got any advice for me?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Number one, meditate.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, most people I know
that claim to be meditating,

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.287 align:middle line:90%
I think they're sleeping.

01:04:04.287 --> 01:04:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I think they're sleeping.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
snoozing, loafing.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Number two, stop complaining.

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Number three, take action.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you can
do is double your goal.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
You're stuck at a certain
level of thinking,

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and the universe is telling
you to think bigger.

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
outside the box.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get rid
of that box altogether.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So whatever your
goal was, double it,

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and you'll go places, and
see things, and meet people

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.887 align:middle line:84%
that you never would have before
because you've got blinders on,

01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to get
rid of those blinders.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.164 align:middle line:90%


01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
You know Michael,
one of the mistakes

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that people make is they
think that they're going

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.080 align:middle line:90%
to wait till there's no fear.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, it
doesn't work like that.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I remember when
I was learning to dive off

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.310 align:middle line:90%
a diving board, there I was.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I was about six years old.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I was about, I don't
know, four feet high.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The diving board was another
three or four feet to the water

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and there was about
nine feet below that.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of feet
that I could drown in.

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get out at
the end of the diving board

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and look at my father
and say, you know,

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I think I have a fear
of jumping into liquids.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to
go see a therapist

01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and I need to get rid of my
fear of jumping in liquids.

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll come back
and I'll do this.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, none of
us ever did that.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What we did is we felt the
fear and we jumped anyway.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is, we survived.

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And think about this, Michael.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
You have survived everything
that ever happened to you.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.610 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
hadn't survived it,

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is, you
have to feel the fear

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:26.593 align:middle line:90%
and take action anyway.

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:27.826 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn
to do that, you're

01:05:27.826 --> 01:05:30.965 align:middle line:84%
going to discover that you find
that it's not that big a deal.

01:05:30.965 --> 01:05:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It gets exciting.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Now I do, like, double flips
off the diving board, and bomb

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
dives, and jump off
high dives, and jump off

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
waterfalls in Africa
and all kinds of things.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was that first
step of feeling the fear

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and doing it anyway, and
that's called courage.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
that-- we all have that.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
choosing to operationalize it.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the keys to a
successful relationship

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is the courage to
acknowledge your mistakes.

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Our pride gets in the way.

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
We want to be right.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It takes a big man,
it takes a high being,

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
to take the high road, and
that's what's being called

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
upon you here is to acknowledge
how did I contribute

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to the problems and
to lower your pride,

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to not make yourself the
most important person here,

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but to make someone else
just as important as you.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And the first step is
making them more important

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and then letting them
make you important.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't give up who
you are, but support

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
who they are so that they
can then see you once again.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
resolve things.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, I
got shot in the chest

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.335 align:middle line:84%
by a deranged stranger
with a 44 Calgary hand gun.

01:06:32.335 --> 01:06:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Hit me right here.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Ended up down by
my fifth lumbar.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.585 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, I
had post traumatic stress

01:06:39.585 --> 01:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
from this experience, a
severe form of anxiety.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
In my recovery from that, I went
looking for some real answers.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to just
cope with the situation.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to actually nail it.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to really,
thoroughly recover.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, when you feel
fear and you feel overwhelmed,

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
make it to just

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
try and suppress
or deny or ignore

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.160 align:middle line:90%
those fears and that feeling.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
What's needed is to actually
fully embrace the fear.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, we
don't know how to do it.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever showed us.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We're all deeply
condition to avoid feeling

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.425 align:middle line:90%
things fully like the plague.

01:07:16.425 --> 01:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
This is because
when we're little,

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
we all get emotionally
overwhelmed,

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and I've yet to meet
anybody who liked it.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So what we do-- and it
seems to be universal--

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is we tend to put a lid on
accessing our own innate

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.570 align:middle line:90%
capacity to feel.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:30.930 align:middle line:90%
We just don't want to go there.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we become
feeling avoidant.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a
set up for becoming

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
really lousy at resolving
things like trauma

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.090 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety and fear.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And what we need
to do is we need

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to do the
exact opposite of what

01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:45.710 align:middle line:90%
we're deeply conditioned to do.

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
When it's a traumatic
energy, we need

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
to go right to the center of the
energy and feel down into it.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the three-year-old
in us does not

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
think this is a very
good idea, but we

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
don't want to three-year-old
running our emotional life.

01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We live in a planet of
people who are basically

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:01.850 align:middle line:90%
emotionally incompetent.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be
successful in life,

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
we have to gain
emotional competence.

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do
that is to learn

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
how to do the exact
opposite of what

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
we're deeply conditioned to do.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are two
ways to do that.

01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, when we have
something that's overwhelming,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
stressful, traumatic,
what we want

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to do is dive right into the
center of the most intense part

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.009 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of that emotion.

01:08:24.009 --> 01:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
What do I mean by
energy of the emotion?

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.439 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the
sensation of the emotion.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:29.540 align:middle line:90%
That's its energy.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Without that, wouldn't
be feeling anything.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out, these traumatic
energies have a kind of vortex,

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
like an eye of a hurricane,
right in their center,

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.800 align:middle line:84%
but we never go there
because we're so deeply

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
conditioned to go away from it.

01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you dive right into
the center of that vortex

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and feel all the way down
it right to the bottom,

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing opens
up and it's gone

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't come back.

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.399 align:middle line:84%
The other one is when you
have a reactive emotion,

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
like a fear, or an anger,
or an upset at some

01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.561 align:middle line:84%
expectation that didn't get met,
which you've got a lot of right

01:08:59.561 --> 01:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The energy of those
kinds of emotions,

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:06.149 align:middle line:84%
I call them not useful
emotions, radiates out

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
into our surroundings, creating
this big cloud or bubble

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:11.109 align:middle line:90%
of energy all around us.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And the way to deal with those
is let your awareness move

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
outward into the
space around you,

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.870 align:middle line:84%
all the way out to the
outer edge of the energy

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
and out beyond that into
the surrounding quietness.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
At The moment you cross over
the edge of that energy field,

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
the energy will start
to shrink and fade away,

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and you'll recognize
you're just projecting

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of a negative
outcome onto the future.

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a story you're
making up about something.

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:36.319 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't even exist anywhere
except in your own mind.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
These are extremely
practical tools,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.439 align:middle line:90%
and you need 'em, Michael.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:44.109 align:middle line:90%
No argument from this side.

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
When external forces
in the world come at me

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like I'm
going to be overwhelmed,

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
it really helps me to
visualize the willow

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:55.790 align:middle line:90%
tree that grows in our yard.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It bends, it flows,
but it doesn't break.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it doesn't is
because it has its roots so

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.090 align:middle line:90%
firmly planted in the earth--

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: You'll
have to excuse him.

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:08.620 align:middle line:90%
He's been through a lot.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:10.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to tell you about
growing up on a farm in Idaho,

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was very, very blessed
to know from the time

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I was a small child
exactly what my destiny

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and what my purpose was.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone has that.

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
For instance, my parents,
who were farmers,

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:32.220 align:middle line:90%
learned to settle.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They learned to make a
conscious choice to be broke.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Well Michael, you're like
many of the people who

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.600 align:middle line:90%
were in this farm community.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't enjoy what they
have now because they were so

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
afraid of what was
coming in the future,

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know if it
would be bad weather, if the hog

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.987 align:middle line:90%
prices would be high.

01:10:51.987 --> 01:10:53.020 align:middle line:90%
That's my problem right there.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
My hog prices are high.
That's the problem.

01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:57.050 align:middle line:90%
I've got high hog prices.

01:10:57.050 --> 01:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: High hog
prices if you're lucky.

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't
take any risks.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't dare
try anything new.

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They were resolved to stay
in their little safe cocoon.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
In my work as a writer, I've
had the great opportunity

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to work with people at
the end of their life

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and to gather end
of life stories.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And do you know what their top
three regrets are is that they

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.640 align:middle line:90%
regret they didn't risk more.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.320 align:middle line:10%
They regret that they
didn't take chances,

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320 align:middle line:10%
that they didn't
start a business,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.410 align:middle line:10%
that they didn't
follow that passion.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
The second one is they regret
that they didn't reflect more.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And Michael, what
a great opportunity

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
you have because you're
in that position.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You can stop right where
you are and you can think,

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
is this who I want to be?

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Is this the kind of
person I want to be?

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.650 align:middle line:90%
What is it that makes me happy?

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And the third one is interesting
because they wish they

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
would have contributed more.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.785 align:middle line:84%
They wish they would have given
more time to their family,

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to the community,
to the schools.

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
They wish they would have been
more of a part of their life.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Not let their life
happen to them,

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
but be the director
of their own life.

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but what if we
have nothing to give?

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, Michael, you
always have something to give.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.895 align:middle line:90%
I got nothing.

01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I got--

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:24.500 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I got less than nothing.

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I got--

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.981 align:middle line:84%
-You have everything.
-I got it.

01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:29.680 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You have blessings you
don't even know about.

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
in a poor me way.

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying, I got nothing.

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:41.711 align:middle line:90%


01:12:41.711 --> 01:12:43.080 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
-You're greedy.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.013 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a negative trait?

01:12:44.013 --> 01:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you owe one back
this side of the town.

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Not that game.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I admire you for being in
this spot and in this space,

01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and I know that you can find
out exactly what your destiny is

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and find your purpose
that you were born with.

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:08.017 align:middle line:90%


01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
You know Michael, one
of the keys to success

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is to have empathy, and
most people don't even

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.180 align:middle line:90%
know what that means.

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.530 align:middle line:90%
But here's what empathy is.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
It's having a
compassionate feeling

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and caring for
another human being.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people when
they're not successful

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
are so focused on themselves--
what I want, what I'm not

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.740 align:middle line:84%
getting, how the world's
being mean to me,

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
et cetera-- that they're
not interested in the people

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.680 align:middle line:90%
around them.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
to develop empathy

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is to demonstrate some
caring for another person,

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and the best way to
do that is simply

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
ask them questions and
listen to the answers.

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Be curious.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, what's it like
to walk in that person's shoes?

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
What kind of questions would
I ask them if I wanted to know

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:45.730 align:middle line:90%
what their life experience is?

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And if I do that, they
then feel cared about.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you
want, give it first.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.670 align:middle line:90%
You want attention?

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Give attention.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
You want to be cared about?

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Care about someone else.

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Be curious.

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Ask questions.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
When you were a little
kid, you were curious.

01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You just have to get back
to that space of ooh,

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what that
person's like.

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what that thing's
like, and allow yourself

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:06.600 align:middle line:90%
to follow that curiosity.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you're going
to see some very magical things

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
happen in your relationships.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Another of the keys to
a successful relationship

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
is empathy.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what separates us
from the lower animal kingdom

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
is this front part of the
brain, the prefrontal cortex,

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
gives us the ability to
hear another point of view.

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we can hear
another point of view,

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
we can truly stand
in their shoes.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you
just see the world

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
through your perspective-- what
you want, what you don't like,

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.870 align:middle line:90%
what you want your life be like.

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:36.870 align:middle line:90%
What about her?

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:37.900 align:middle line:90%
What are her pictures?

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Let her know that you can
feel what she's feeling.

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You understand what
she's going through.

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And with that
compassion that arises,

01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
you have the wisdom
to figure out

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and to find the truth of how
to resolve the situation.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
When your partner
can sense that you're

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
relating to them
from that level,

01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:56.020 align:middle line:90%
that's what rebuilds trust.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what says
you really care.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
The key is making sure that
you take the first step.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're waiting
for her to change,

01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
if you feel that she has to
change, nothing will happen.

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
You have the power
to create change

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.740 align:middle line:90%
if you take the step first.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
What's helped me be
successful is my ability

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
to be empathetic to my clients.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call the
doctor that I'm going

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.760 align:middle line:90%
to be speaking about Dr. Smith.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a surgical team
of about five physicians.

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
They were working on a child,
and a mistake was made.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the child was lost.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
In fear of the repercussions
and liability and everything

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that goes along with that,
nobody on the surgical team

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
said a word to the parents with
the exception of one physician,

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's Dr. Smith.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He was actually doubled
over from the pain.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I need to express
my empathy with these parents.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
He went up to him and
said, I am so sorry.

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it's
like to be in your shoes,

01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.470 align:middle line:90%
but I feel for you.

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
A couple years later, a lawsuit
was brought against them.

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It was brought against every one
of them except for Dr. Smith.

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So the lawyer involved,
he went to the client

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and he asked the child's mother,
why aren't you suing Dr. Smith?

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because he was
the only one that came up to us

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and said he was so
sorry and that he cared.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.895 align:middle line:84%
He was human, so
we left him out.

01:16:30.895 --> 01:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%


01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.610 align:middle line:84%
MARCI: It was 1942, and Susi
Penzias had fled Nazi Germany.

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
She was in Italy
trying to hide away.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And she was taking
a train ride one day

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
when all of a sudden, two
police officers came on board.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were dressed in the
government Fascisti uniforms.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were on board
going passenger by passenger

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.045 align:middle line:90%
to inspect everyone's papers.

01:17:00.045 --> 01:17:01.527 align:middle line:84%
Well, Susi knew
exactly what was going

01:17:01.527 --> 01:17:02.560 align:middle line:90%
to happen when they got to her.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have any
papers, and they

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
were going to find
here and send her

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
away to the Nazi concentration
camps to certainly her death.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And as they got closer, Susi
started trembling and sobbing.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And the stranger sitting next to
her on the train looked at her

01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:20.080 align:middle line:90%
and said, what's wrong?

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Why are you crying?

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.755 align:middle line:84%
And she whispered
to him, I'm Jewish

01:17:23.755 --> 01:17:27.230 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have any papers.

01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He paused for a few seconds,
and then he yelled at her.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.470 align:middle line:90%
You idiot.

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:33.610 align:middle line:90%
You imbecile.

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe you did that.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.490 align:middle line:90%
How stupid of you.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
She was shocked, and she
began sobbing even more.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And at this commotion,
the two police officers

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
came over to them and
said, what's going on here?

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.395 align:middle line:84%
And the man looked up
at the police officers

01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and said, officers,
take this woman away.

01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
My wife, she's
forgotten her papers.

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I have my papers, but
she's forgotten hers.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
She always forgets everything.
I'm sick of her.

01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Take her away.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And at that, the
police officers just

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
chuckled at the marital
spat and moved on past them.

01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
In one courageous act, that
stranger saved Susi's life.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Susi never saw that man again.

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
She never even knew his name.

01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The greatest people in
life are not necessarily

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
those who are creating
huge businesses,

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
but they are those who
act in every moment

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.400 align:middle line:90%
out of love and compassion.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:41.000 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:41.815 align:middle line:90%
The last room.

01:18:41.815 --> 01:18:43.241 align:middle line:84%
-This is the last room?
-Yes.

01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
All right.
Wait a minute.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I might not want to see it.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
If all we're going to
look at is like my funeral

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and nobody's there, let's
just skip it and move on.

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
If what lies beyond this
door are your greatest fears,

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.930 align:middle line:90%
you need to face them.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:56.165 align:middle line:84%
If not--
-What?

01:18:56.165 --> 01:19:00.371 align:middle line:90%


01:19:00.371 --> 01:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
What?
What?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Tell me.
What?

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't just
look away ominously

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.830 align:middle line:90%
like that fake movie look.

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
What?
-Come with me.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:16.002 align:middle line:90%


01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you see those statues?

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.400 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
They tried to run away
from their own fear,

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
but they were pulled back by
their suppressed emotions.

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:27.160 align:middle line:90%


01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they became so
caught up in their own denial

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.595 align:middle line:84%
that they literally froze
within their inner turmoil.

01:19:32.595 --> 01:19:36.486 align:middle line:90%


01:19:36.486 --> 01:19:38.185 align:middle line:84%
You're going to tell me
that with a straight face?

01:19:38.185 --> 01:19:41.270 align:middle line:90%
That is what happened.

01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but that is the
worst scare story I've ever

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
heard in my whole life ever.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.508 align:middle line:84%
Frozen in time by
their fear and denial.

01:19:49.508 --> 01:19:50.502 align:middle line:90%
You see them?

01:19:50.502 --> 01:19:51.496 align:middle line:90%
I see 'em.

01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:52.987 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, look at that.

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:55.472 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:19:55.472 --> 01:20:55.180 align:middle line:90%


01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.644 align:middle line:84%
Michael, running away
from your problems

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:57.972 align:middle line:90%
is not the solution, man.

01:20:57.972 --> 01:21:59.724 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.724 --> 01:22:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:06.626 align:middle line:90%


01:22:06.626 --> 01:22:08.125 align:middle line:84%
ELIZABETH: These are
all potential realities.

01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:12.110 align:middle line:90%


01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:18.900 align:middle line:10%
The possibility of each one
already exists within you,

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.385 align:middle line:10%
along with many others.

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:23.850 align:middle line:90%


01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:26.268 align:middle line:84%
But none of them are what
you're here to confront.

01:22:26.268 --> 01:22:32.910 align:middle line:90%


01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:36.335 align:middle line:84%
Your greatest fear is
simply the realization

01:22:36.335 --> 01:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
that you create it all.

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:41.870 align:middle line:90%
(ECHOING) It's up to you.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:23:04.657 align:middle line:90%


01:23:04.657 --> 01:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL (VOICEOVER):
Without a doubt,

01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
the craziest dream
I've ever had.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
It was really vivid, though,
almost like watching a movie,

01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:11.010 align:middle line:90%
or being in one.

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Wish I would have woken up
with that $1,000 in my pocket,

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
or at least the $300 I had left.

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.500 align:middle line:90%
That's odd.
