00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:14.475
(music)

2
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:19.180
(cars honking)

3
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.656
<v ->I love going fast.</v>

4
00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:23.524
I love swooping around corners too.

5
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:24.755
(car honking)

6
00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.588
You get the spectators like "oh wow. Look at that guy."

7
00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:31.907
And you feel like batman or spiderman a little bit.

8
00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:35.304
<v ->Bike messengers, it's not bad.</v>

9
00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:37.112
Sometimes they give you a heart attack.

10
00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:41.342
<v ->I trained for a few years in the Navy in the SEAL program.</v>

11
00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:43.176
It takes a certain amount of toughness

12
00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.971
to be a bike messenger.

13
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.443
You ride like me and you're going to get into some

14
00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:49.111
pretty scary situations.

15
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.832
(upbeat music)

16
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:13.521
You know people are darting in and out of cars

17
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.016
and those doors fly open.

18
00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:16.236
Woah. Sorry dude.

19
00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:19.316
Over the years i've developed reflexes where I can

20
00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.595
reach over my handlebars and close the door

21
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:22.944
if it's opening on me.

22
00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:32.560
The alleycat races that we have in New York

23
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.504
are arranged by messengers.

24
00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.669
You usually get a small prize like a message bag or

25
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:39.124
you know, a few dollars.

26
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:44.677
I'm usually at the front of the line trying to win.

27
00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:46.726
I don't go out to come in second place.

28
00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:48.436
Second place is the first loser.

29
00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:55.822
<v ->Yac? Well the obvious is that any big race he comes to</v>

30
00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:57.447
he's gonna win it.

31
00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:00.099
Like he doesn't just race like, you know, road races.

32
00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.073
Like, you know, you see these guys wearing spandex

33
00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:04.110
all twinkied up from head to toe riding through

34
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.040
central park thinking they're bad.

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.688
You know, Yac can rock it on the ten speed on the road race.

36
00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:11.697
He can rock it on the mountain bike race,

37
00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.695
you know, he's like multi-skilled.

38
00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:19.672
He's a good guy.

39
00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.381
In the basic Brooklyn, Queens meaning of the word,

40
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.639
he's a good fellow.

41
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.453
He's always got your back in a fight.

42
00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.564
He'll always help you if your bike's busted

43
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.282
and it's something you can fix and he's around.

44
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.722
He'll take a look at it.

45
00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:33.311
Use his mechanical skills to help you out.

46
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:36.960
He's crowned king of New York City messengers.

47
00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:38.736
<v ->Hope you like New York.</v>

48
00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:39.288
<v ->Thank you.</v>

49
00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:39.988
<v ->Gotta go.</v>

50
00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:51.193
(music)

51
00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:58.676
<v ->Everything you think you can do in an airplane,</v>

52
00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.002
everything you could even dream up is what I like to do

53
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:01.834
in my airplane.

54
00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:17.805
To be a good and safe aerobatic pilot,

55
00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:21.092
you have to have 100% concentrative focus.

56
00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:24.702
And that's one of the reasons why I really like what I do

57
00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:28.446
is because it forces me to get rid of all the other sort of

58
00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:30.899
extraneous thoughts and all the mundane stuff

59
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.810
that happens around you during the course of your life,

60
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.792
and get inside this tunnel and think of nothing else

61
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:40.482
but flying the airplane.

62
00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.899
If a woman makes a mistake or they don't do as well,

63
00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.308
I think they're under more scrutiny than the men are.

64
00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:54.791
I think you really have to be a little bit better than

65
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:56.839
the guys to prove yourself.

66
00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.411
And I like that.

67
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.598
My friend Leo Laudenslager, the great aerobatic pilot,

68
00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:05.265
told me once there are three things that you can't deal with

69
00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:08.187
Patti and he said there's jealousy, hatred, and greed

70
00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.955
and you're going to find all three of those in competition.

71
00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:16.336
You can't deal with it so let it go and don't let the creeps

72
00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.568
get you down.

73
00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:28.325
<v ->It was the hardest thing in the world to hear my mother</v>

74
00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:30.991
weeping in the background as the judge passed sentence

75
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:32.244
upon me.

76
00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:38.023
I was lying to my mother stating that I was going to hang

77
00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:40.207
with this guy that I met in high school.

78
00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:43.439
And on one fateful night, I decided to commit armed robbery,

79
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.225
which cost me six years of my life.

80
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.845
While I was incarcerated, I continued to get my education

81
00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:51.271
and I learned how to box.

82
00:04:56.878 --> 00:04:59.086
A lot of guys have been fighting since they been little boys

83
00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:01.938
while I have only been competing for a couple years.

84
00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:06.147
I was able to make up for my lack of experience,

85
00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:08.174
ring experience, from my heart.

86
00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.876
Because my heart carried me a whole lot of distance.

87
00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:14.364
<v ->Come on. Work a little bit harder than that.</v>

88
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.127
<v ->I decided say, no what ifs</v>

89
00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:20.727
I didn't want to be an old man on my rocking chair

90
00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:21.990
saying what ifs.

91
00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.903
So I came out here with my goals in mind

92
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.385
and aimed for the Olympics, which I was able to obtain

93
00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:35.106
in a little under two years.

94
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.025
My name is Michael Bennet.

95
00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:38.624
I'm a U.S. Olympic athlete.

96
00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:41.696
I represented us as a captain of the U.S. Olympic

97
00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:43.306
boxing team.

98
00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:45.547
I set that goal for myself and I grabbed it

99
00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:46.475
and I put it in my pocket.

100
00:05:46.475 --> 00:05:48.213
I brought it home to my mother to show her like

101
00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:49.780
look at the good job I did.

102
00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:57.439
A host of other men that I've met along my path

103
00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.375
and took time out to invest in me.

104
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:02.356
I'm trying to give back.

105
00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:06.001
Trying not to allow the streets to swallow them up

106
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:09.675
because as long as he stays in here he's safe.

107
00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:16.051
<v ->He treated me like i'm special.</v>

108
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.018
He write with me, play with me.

109
00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.272
And he's like a father to me.

110
00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:31.912
<v ->Says you already box. Says you already box you gonna...</v>

111
00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:35.720
Right now you're looking at the future and truly

112
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.229
if God blesses me to bless him you'll see him

113
00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.247
somewhere along these lines as being a champion as well

114
00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:45.084
and hopefully in the summer Olympics,

115
00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:47.459
maybe eight years from now.

116
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.267
(laughter)
