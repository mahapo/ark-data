At the moment we are in a state

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.912 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I took an oath and swore to
defend the constitution,

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I did not take an oath to

Edward Snowden did something
that was important

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:43.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and it was a heroic act.

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.797 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To call these people
superheroes is not so good,

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
because it sets them up.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
For some people they
are superheroes,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.138 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
for others simply traitors:

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Whistleblowers like Daniel
Ellsberg, Thomas Drake

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
William Binney and
Edward Snowden.

Hackers and activists like the

and the former British secret

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.615 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They warn us about the complete
surveillance of our society.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They oppose
intelligence agencies,

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.537 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
governments and corporations.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.372 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And for this they
are threatened,

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.457 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
hounded and imprisoned.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%

of all whistleblowers:
Daniel Ellsberg.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.671 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I’m probably the only whistle
blower, that I know of,

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
who can make a living
as a lecturer

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.427 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because I’m the one who was
put on trial for 115 years

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:20.265 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I’m the one who was involved in
a president being... resigning

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
because of his
crimes against me.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So he made me notorious enough

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.607 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that I can make a
living as a lecturer.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.069 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Ellsberg studied economic
science at Harvard

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.031 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the 1950's. After
graduating he enrolled,

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.867 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
like many fellow whistleblowers,
in the military

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.877 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And you see courage
there all around you

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the conventional
sort, high courage.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:55.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You’ve been trained for it,
you’ve been disciplined for it

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but you see it, it happens
if the training works.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And people are
risking their bodies

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.518 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and their lives every minute.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.606 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
At the end of the
1960's Ellsberg

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.067 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
worked at the US
embassy in Vietnam.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.573 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He became known by publishing
the secret Pentagon papers,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:22.494 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which proved the US president
had lied to the American public

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.663 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
about the Vietnam
War for years.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Ellsberg decided to make
the documents public.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.798 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
after meeting peace activists,
who had refused the draft.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I would not have
thought of doing it,

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:46.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
if didn’t have the example
of many, many people

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
who were going to prison

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
for nonviolent
resistance to the craft.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In 1969 Ellsberg began
smuggling parts

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.282 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
of the “Pentagon Papers” out
of the government agency

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:04.369 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
he worked for and copied them
over the following months.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.457 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
A total of 7,000 pages
of secret documents.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In March 1971 he passed the
documents to the New York Times,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
who eventually printed them.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Ellsberg surrendered himself
and was charged with theft

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.139 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and unauthorized possession
of Pentagon material.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.397 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The trial collapsed
when it came to light

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that Nixon had illegally
wire-tapped Ellsberg

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and agents had broken into
his psychiatrist's office.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Ellsberg thereafter
remained a free man.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:58.256 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If they arrest me or indict me,
then I will say it was only me.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Patricia, who was standing
next to me, did cooperate,

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:09.017 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it so happens, and she...
I couldn’t figure out why

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:13.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
she wasn’t indicted, my
wife, because she had done

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:17.526 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a lot of copying, had her
fingerprints all over the paper

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.904 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the reason I thought it was,
was because they didn’t want

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
such a beautiful woman
sitting next to me

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.534 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
at the defense table
in front of the jury.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.123 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I would advise people now
not to do what I did,

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to reveal themselves,
if they can avoid it.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:41.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I revealed myself for the same
reason Snowden did, essentially.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We knew, that other people
would be suspected,

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
maybe even charged,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with circumstantial
evidence against them.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%

more guilty than you did.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
NSA employee Edward Snowden
emerges as a whistleblower.

The USA now has a new

Thanks to Manning

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I am getting more favorable
publicity than in 40 years.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Because suddenly people who were
all for putting me in prison

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
for life before,
now realize that

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.605 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I was really a very good guy.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.317 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I was the good whistle-blower

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And so, I totally of
course rejected this

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.657 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
from the beginning, I
didn’t want to be a foil

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:33.536 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
for showing up badly two
people that I totally admire.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
There was a moment at HOPE
X, the HOPE X conference

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.208 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
in July in New York City.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:45.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Ellsburg was having a live
conversation with Snowden.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We have a right as
Americans, and as members

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of the global community,

of government policies that
have a significant impact

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
on our lives and I think
that’s something,

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that Tom Drake showed me how
to do it the right way.

very distinctly that I
showed him the right way.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.792 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I had always hoped that a
Snowden would come along.

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Thomas Drake served during
the “Cold War” in Europe

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the 1980's with the
US Air Force

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which included work as a

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.053 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
hoovering the Soviet Union.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:36.307 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So my day job is reconnaissance
of another country

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:41.604 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and then my hobby
was computers.

You have these bulletin
boards and I’m dialing

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:57.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
into your Chaos Computer Club.

a blur. Because it was just..

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:24.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%

I was selected as the designated
senior executive NSA,

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.717 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to lead up that effort, to find
anything we had in the fight.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.177 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
And so I did.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And that’s where I brought
to the attention of others

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tools, techniques, programs,
things that are in the lab,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.479 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
things that were pilots, things
that are being just test bed.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The mantra, that went out
from NSA by general Hayden,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
he kept going around, saying,
we just need to make Americans

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:15.031 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
feel safe again. Feel safe.
Even add banners.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:19.035 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And I discovered during those
first couple of three weeks

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
after 9/11, all of
this information,

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that as you can imagine,

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:28.211 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was pouring in after 9/11,
literally being used to monitor

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:33.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and surveill and intercept
US domestic communications

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.426 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on an extraordinarily
broad scale.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:40.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I was finding this out
within days of 9/11

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:43.768 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and others were coming to me
saying what are we doing Tom?

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:46.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Among the Snowden
documents were figures

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.064 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
for the US secret
service budget.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.611 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Since September 11th they
supposedly doubled

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:58.867 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
from 25 billion to 52
billion US Dollars in 2013.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The surveillance programs
continued to metastasize.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.253 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They continued to
expand in ways

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.422 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that still have not
been fully revealed.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.841 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And this became sort of the

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.552 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
collect-it-all
mindset mentality.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:22.307 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What does that lead to? Well,
yes, your securitization,

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you have these other interesting
arrangements with certain

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:30.106 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
internet providers and
telecommunication concerns.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So the temptations are
enormous and its like hey,

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
give us access and
hack in or open it up

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and that’s what happened, I mean

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and now you’re seeing
a lot of this unfold.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:47.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The National Security
Agency, NSA for short,

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the largest foreign
intelligence agency in the USA,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.713 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
has been responsible for
the worldwide monitoring

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of electronic
communication since 1952.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Some of the 35,000 employees
weren't comfortable

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:05.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with the massive expansion of
surveillance since September 11.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.853 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All of the colleagues
that I knew,

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.355 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which was just a handful,

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Bill Binney,
Ed Loomis, Kirk Wiebe,

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:18.029 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
chose to retire from the
NSA in late October 2001.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They realized what
was happening,

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.699 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
they could not stand by

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:25.536 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and see the subversion of the
constitution and all the work

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:29.207 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that they had done being
used for mass surveillance.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:33.127 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They left the agency, I
begged them to stay.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I chose to remain and fight from
within, as long as I could.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I got mad at them. And so my
objective was to counterattack.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I don’t believe in
defense, you know?

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.395 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Just sitting back and
being defensive.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.022 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean, you have to get
out there and attack.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.858 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So that’s what I started doing.
That was my point.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
It’s time to attack.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.737 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So basically it was a
declaration of war.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Me against my government.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
William Binney, mathematician
and programmer,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
initially worked for the
NSA as an analyst,

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:13.543 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
then later as the technical
director of the secret service.

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
As the boss of a 6,000
strong team he developed

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:21.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
developed a wire-tap programme
that anonymously filtered

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and processed large
volumes of data.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:33.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I tried to do the right
thing, right after 9/11,

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:36.899 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
trying to make a contribution
that would make a difference.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.861 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They refused to accept it,
so I was basically blocked.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:41.529 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
There was nothing I could do,

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.489 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
they would accept
nothing from me.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The NSA directors decided
against the programme

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.411 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
from Binney's team and
opted for another

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that collected much more data.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:14:07.764 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The problem is, I helped
in designing

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the system that’s in use.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Because I knew what was
possible once they started

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:20.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
using those programs and opening
it up to massive data input

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.072 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
on everybody on the planet,
so it was pretty clear,

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it was obvious to me
how they were using it

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:29.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and what they were doing
with it, so... I mean

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because I understood the
design of the systems.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.501 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And so after that, when they
started spying on US-citizens

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and violating the
constitution I had to leave.

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I couldn’t be a part of
all the criminal activity

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that was going on. I mean,
that’s fundamentally...

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.762 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I call that treason
against the country.

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:53.017 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So I got out at the end of
October, Halloween day 2001.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.646 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
One year later Binney
submitted a complaint

00:14:56.646 --> 00:15:00.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to the US Defence Department
for wasting state funds.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:03.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The complaint was examined
but had no effect.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:08.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The patriot Bill Binney became
a combative whistleblower -

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a role model for many today.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
personally and I have to say
that I had met more people

with true integrity and

<i>LAUGHTER</i>

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
While Binney opted
out of the system,

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
his colleague Thomas Drake
fought against the violation

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:17.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of democratic civil rights
from within the NSA.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I knew from the moment I stood
up to my own supervisor

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and I went to her and
said: What are we doing?

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:30.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Violating the prime directive.
You can not spy on Americans

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
without a warrant. You
don’t understand.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.789 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I confronted my boss, I go to
the office and the council,

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.959 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
I confront him.
And then he says:

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.878 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Don’t ask any more questions.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:48.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now you’re faced with a dilemma.
I didn’t give the order,

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:51.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I’m not the one, that was
implementing the surveillance...

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:54.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the mass surveillance program,
the digital drag net.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:57.683 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
What do you do? I chose
to blow the whistle.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.615 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
But how do you do that?

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Knowing there is a mass
surveillance program and knowing

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that NSA was targeting,
“targeting” journalists.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:27.213 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:33.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to communicate anonymously

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Then I made a decision, that
I would meet the reporter.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:46.857 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That was in February of 2007.

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:52.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The journalist subsequently
published a number of articles

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.865 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
about the waste and
mismanagement in the NSA.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The repercussions were
enormous but the NSA

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
let the attacks
come to nothing,

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as Drake did not prove
the central part

00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
of his criticism
with documents.

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:08.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This tactic suddenly
stopped working in 2013.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Edward Snowden's material,
though it’s stuffy,

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.303 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
made it absolutely
impossible for them to deny

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:18.848 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
what they were doing because its
simply laid out in their terms

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
on their slides, what
they were doing.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.644 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And it was impossible
for them to deny it.

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I don’t think Mr
Snowden was a patriot.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:30.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The way in which these
disclosures happened

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:36.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
have been damaging
to the United States

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:40.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and damaging to our
Intelligence capabilities.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:44.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
People ask, as I see it,
is he patriot or traitor?

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:47.001 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You know, that’s the headline
in all these things.

00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:50.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
“Edward Snowden: Patriot or
Traitor?” That drives me nuts.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.756 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
The very thought, you know,

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that people could regard
you as a traitor.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What we will likely face
is the cost in human lives

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:03.851 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
on tomorrow's battlefield
or in some place

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:07.021 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
where we will put
our military forces

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
when we asked them
to go into harms way

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.651 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I think that’s the
greatest cost that we face

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:17.281 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
with the disclosures that
have been presented so far.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Snowden was the one
person in the fucking NSA

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who did what he absolutely
should have done.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.415 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
How many people should
have done what you did?

<i>CLAPPING AND CHEERING</i>

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:34.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What Snowden is revealing
is the global threat

00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to potential for
democracy anywhere.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:42.264 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Being a patriot doesn’t
mean, you know,

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
obedience to authority.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:51.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Putting aside your obligations
to your people, to your country,

00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for the benefit of
your government

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:56.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is the opposite of patriotism.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:02.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Until the revelations by
Edward Snowden,

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.578 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the warnings of
intelligence agency critics

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
were always shrugged
off as speculation.

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:11.335 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Only after he had published all
the original NSA documents

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.838 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
was there a proof and
concrete evidence

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
provided for the first time.

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Documents make all
the difference.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It is more risky to do
that, it also makes

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.521 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
all the difference in terms
of political effect.

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Snowden, Manning and I
gave the documents.

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:35.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Less than one percent of
the Snowden documents

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
have been published.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:40.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that’s terrible.
It’s a terrible thing.

00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:45.035 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Those documents do not
belong to a journalist,

00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:47.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
they do not belong
to Edward Snowden.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.833 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
They do not belong to the
National Security Agency.

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.501 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
They belong to history.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.838 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They are a part of something
that humanity has gone through.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Every single one
of us have been...

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:02.928 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
has been a victim of National
Security Agencies spying.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:07.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
All human beings who use the
internet are victims of it

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:11.061 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the victims deserve to know
what has happened to them.

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:35.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think the opportunity is
in producing a very broad

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:39.256 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
global outrage about what has
happened in every country

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:42.051 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and informing all the victims
of that surveillance

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.345 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
about what has actually
happened to them.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:46.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And releasing enough
documents so that all

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:49.558 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the technical
industries, hackers

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and computer programmers

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and all the governments can work
out how to protect themselves.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Julian Assange, hacker
and journalist,

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:02.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
was interested in computer
programming from an early age.

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:04.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
As a teenager he
had already hacked

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:08.327 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
into foreign data systems
and military networks.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:11.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Later he studied physics and
mathematics in Melbourne.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
In 2006 he founded

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the whistleblowing
website WikiLeaks,

00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which publishes secret
documents of governments,

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.382 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
intelligence agencies
and corporations.

00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:23.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Daniel Ellsberg was an insider

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:25.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and Edward Snowden
was an insider.

00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:29.515 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I would say, that I
was never an Insider.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:39.149 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I was inside Military and
Intelligence in big companies

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:42.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
as a computer hacker and
later as an analyst

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
analyzing their material,
so I had a keen sense,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.785 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for what their were about
but I never had the view

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that one should work for
those organizations.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:57.042 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
For people who were in the
US-National Security System

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:59.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
it was like they
were on a drug.

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.923 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
A drug, that made
them powerful,

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because they were in a group
that had a lot of power.

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:11.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And that system has a way
of talking about how

00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:17.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the world works and how
the United States Empire

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is a good thing and it
can take a long time

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to wash that drug
out of the system.

00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:26.071 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Daniel Ellsberg has
nearly entirely

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
washed that out of his system,

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:29.825 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but the more recent
whistle-blowers,

00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:32.536 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
they still have perhaps
some way to go.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.914 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The only difference I have
from Assange is I think,

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
the only difference is, I think,

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:42.463 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that he probably believes
more in the value

00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of total or near total
transparency, than I do.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
On WikiLeaks, highly explosive
documents can still be published

00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
anonymously that otherwise
would be withheld

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.934 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
through non-disclosure
or censorship.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:58.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
According to WikiLeaks
all documents

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:00.105 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
are checked for authenticity.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.232 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
One major aim is to
force corporations

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:04.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and intelligence agencies
agencies to abide

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:07.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to more transparency and
social responsibility.

00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:10.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
To shed light on their
well kept secrets,

00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:12.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
which cover up illegal
and immoral behaviour.

00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:36.558 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That is just this
rhetorical counter attack,

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.061 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which is like something
out of kindergarten.

00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:41.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Which is to say: No,
no you do that.

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:49.363 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And unfortunately the
US press is so...

00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:53.701 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
sort of servile that it
reprints this nonsense.

00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:57.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So WikiLeaks reveals
very concretely

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:00.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with extremely
accurate documentation

00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:04.586 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
how the US’s own records
show that it was involved

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:07.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in one way or another in
the deaths of more than

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:09.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
120 000 people in
Irak and Afghanistan

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:12.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
between 2004 and 2010.

00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:15.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And the US governments
response is,

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:19.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
maybe hypothetically as a result
of the release of this material

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:24.523 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
some Afghan family or US
soldier could face risks.

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.775 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
That’s the standard accusation.

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Or like what Tom Drake did
threatened military lives,

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:33.073 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
well exposing corruption,
fraud, waste and abuse

00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
doesn’t threaten
military lives,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.911 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
continuing them threatens
military lives.

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Now the end result is that they
were forced to admit last year,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
under oath, not a single
person had been harmed

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
as a result of that publication.
Not one.

00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:24.166 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
risking their
careers, their lives,

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:27.753 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to expose the wrongdoings
of those in power?

00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:30.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Is there a common aim,
a collective mission

00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of this broad alliance and
wild mix of patriotic

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
ex-secret service agents,
anarchic hackers,

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
cyberpunks and
intellectual publicists?

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The common theme among all
of us is that we support

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.648 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
human rights and
that we support

00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:50.901 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the public’s right
to know information

00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:53.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
especially when it
threatens the public

00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or threatens the democracy or
the freedom of individuals.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I mean, that’s the
kind of common theme

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:01.036 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that goes through
all of it, I think.

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But it’s a lonely act, that
you commit as one person.

00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:08.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But I was convicted by the
truth of what I knew.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.921 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
So I made a conscious choice,

00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:16.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to yes, violate a 'non
disclosure' agreement.

00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:19.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We also took the oath to protect
and defend the constitution

00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:24.142 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:26.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So that means even
our government,

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.522 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
if its violating
the constitution,

00:27:28.522 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so we have the responsibility
to stand up against that.

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:34.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
It’s the moral agency.

00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:42.327 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You’re confronted by activity
that demands a response.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And you’re in a place, where you
have access to information,

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:49.209 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
you have access,
you’re eye-witness.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You’re essentially
eye witness

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.506 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
or you’re brought
into awareness.

00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:54.107 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To call these people
superheroes is not so good,

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:56.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
because it sets them up
on a pedestal, to say

00:28:56.652 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"Well, they did it, I admire
that, but they are not me."

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
" I am not a superhero."

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:03.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Who thinks of themselves
as a superhero?

00:29:03.617 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Only nuts, you know, or 16 year
olds dream of it, you know.

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:12.376 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So that’s your excuse
for not doing it.

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:14.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It doesn’t take a superhero.

00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:16.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And none of these people would

00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:18.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
have been identified
as superheroes.

00:30:43.341 --> 00:31:05.489 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:09.618 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Is democracy possible
with the executive branch

00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:12.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in each country, whether its
nominally democratic or not,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
knowing everything about
the private lives

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of all of their citizens, their
legislators, their journalists,

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:22.631 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
their judges and their
ordinary people,

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:24.716 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
who can be turned
into informants.

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:29.012 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
With those people knowing almost
nothing about the government.

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:32.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The government being
opaque and secretive

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and the people
being transparent.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:37.604 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You guys, this is the most
ridiculous shit I’ve ever seen,

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you know, you’re spying on
everybody in the country,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.983 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and everybody in the world.

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You’re not even bothering to
get a court order for it —

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.115 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a real court order, instead
of your secret court order.

00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:50.826 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
If you don’t have privacy
in your communications,

00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
if you can't guarantee,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that you can hold a
telephone conversation

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or write an email or view stuff
from the internet or read books,

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:01.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
once that is known
to the authorities

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:04.172 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you begin to self-censor what
you say and what you read.

00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:07.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Annie Machon is a former agent

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:11.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the British national
intelligence agency MI5.

00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You begin to withdraw a little
bit from your normal life

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because you are told
you can't mention

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you’re being recruited by MI5.

00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:21.731 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that means that
people tend to focus

00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
much more on their
life within MI5.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So you begin to socialize a lot
more with other people there.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.197 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Because you can
talk about stuff.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:31.575 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And also you end up
mainly in relationships

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:33.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with your fellow
intelligence officers.

00:32:33.743 --> 00:32:35.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Which is how I met
my former partner

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and colleague David Shayler.

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:39.666 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
When Shayler made the
illegal practices

00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.793 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the intelligence
service public,

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:45.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Annie Machon supported him
in becoming a whistleblower.

00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:50.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In 1997, shortly
before the publication

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:52.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of the secret documents,

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the couple flew to France.

00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:58.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They went underground
for a year

00:32:58.351 --> 00:33:00.979 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and subsequently lived
in Paris for two years.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In 2000 they
returned to London.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.193 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Shayler went to prison.
Machon was spared.

00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:09.154 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Since then she fights for
government accountability

00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.823 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and campaigns for the
rights of whistleblowers.

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:14.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
When David Shayler and I ended
up and going on the run

00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
after we had blown the whistle
on a series of crimes from MI5,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we were very conscious
of exactly how they

00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:23.335 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
could be targeting us
and investigating us.

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:25.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So wherever we were,
we thought, well,

00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:27.422 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the telephone might
be compromised,

00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:29.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the computer might
be compromised,

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
there might be microphones
in where we were living,

00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:35.639 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there might be little video
cameras, recording what we did

00:33:35.639 --> 00:33:38.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and also people might be
turned to report against us.

00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:41.853 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So there are all these different
techniques they can use.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this was way back in the
nineties – the Analogue era.

00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:47.943 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So even at that point when
we were on the run from MI5

00:33:47.943 --> 00:33:50.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
across Europe we used
the only sure fire way

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.281 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that we knew to communicate
to each other securely.

00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:56.701 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Which was to put a piece of
glass or ceramic on a surface

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.536 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and put one sheet
of paper on it.

00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:01.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And then you cover it,
so that nothing can read

00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:02.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
what you are writing
on the paper.

00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:05.877 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You don’t say anything, you
just write what you want

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
on the piece of paper.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.382 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then you allow the other
person to read that message.

00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:12.759 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So there is no audio,
there can be no video

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:15.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and there can be no imprint
under that one piece of paper.

00:34:15.971 --> 00:34:19.140 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Then of course you have to get
rid of that piece of paper

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.726 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
so you have to burn it
up, pulverize the ashes

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and either cast it to the winds
or tip the ashes down the loo.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Because we know that our
computers, our telephones,

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:31.319 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
all of that can be compromised.

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.571 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The video can be
switched on remotely;

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.657 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the audio can be
switched on remotely.

00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:38.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They can log what we
write on the keyboards.

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:41.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They can even – and this comes
from the Snowden disclosures –

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:44.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they can even use micro
waves apparently to beam

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
onto the screen and read
what you are typing.

We live in a digital world
where little remains unseen,

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
turning privacy into
another luxury good.

with seemingly endless

00:35:24.414 --> 00:35:28.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
technical possibilities now
only seems a question of time.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:31.671 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
How does this change our
behaviour if every move we make,

00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:34.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
every word we say is
recorded and analyzed?

00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:36.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Which roles will
we have to play?

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And who is writing the script?

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Having lived with that sense
of endemic surveillance

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I can tell you its corrosive
to the human spirit.

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.104 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So once you loose
that sense of privacy

00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:49.731 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and you start to self-censor,

00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:52.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you stop to be an effective
and fully integrated citizen

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:53.735 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
of that country

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:56.071 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so privacy in my view
is the last defense

00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
against the slide towards a
police state or totalitarianism.

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:02.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
If you let go your
rights for a moment,

00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:04.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you have lost them
for a lifetime.

00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:06.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And that’s why this matters:

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:08.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It’s because it happened and
we didn’t know about it.

00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.543 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
We weren’t told about it.

have nothing to hide,

00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:41.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
so you have nothing to worry
about, you have nothing to fear.

Okay, fine…

00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:46.121 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
do you live in an

00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:48.039 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Yes. Well, just
give me your keys!

rent it, you've got a car

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you'd rather rent
it or lease it, yes?

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Give me your car-keys!

Turn them over to me too.

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:06.891 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Oh by the way, all those bank
accounts and telephone records,

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
yeah just give them to
me for safekeeping!

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:10.979 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Can you have
independent courts,

00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:13.648 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
can you have an independent
press? None of that.

00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:16.818 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
NSA now has the potential
to know every source

00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:19.112 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of every journalist
of every story.

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:22.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
By following the emails,
following the phones,

00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:26.578 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
following the people with their
GPS, with their iphones.

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:40.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Mass surveilling in general is
not about surveilling you,

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:42.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's not about surveilling me.

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:45.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's about surveilling
us, collectively.

00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:49.851 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It's about watching the company
for everybody in the country

00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:51.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and on a global scale.

00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:17.128 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In harsh contrast to the
recently emerged facts,

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:19.714 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
great public outcry has
not yet been heard.

Now, why don’t people care?

00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In the UK it’s a very easy
answer. Partly it's cultural

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because we're still in
love with James Bond

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:32.143 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and our political leaders
immediately came out

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:34.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
in defense of the Intelligence
Agencies, saying:

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
“We know what they do.
They follow the law.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.526 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Everyone get back to sleep.
Don’t worry.”

00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:41.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So the debate has been
very muted in the UK.

00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:45.740 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It wasn’t, I think, as I said
in USA, Brazil and Germany,

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it’s amazing how
quickly people forget.

in autumn 2013

00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:34.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that even the private cell
phone of German chancellor

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:37.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Angela Merkel was
tapped by the NSA,

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:40.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the public outcry in Germany
was initially large.

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:44.549 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Until then, the German-American
friendship had been close

00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:47.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and Germany believed
to be an equal partner

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of the United States.

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Do friends spy on friends?
Of course they do!

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.017 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Everybody does.

00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:57.562 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean we caught the Isrealis
spying on us several times,

00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:59.689 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
what did that do to
our relationship?

00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:03.192 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Not really anything, because we
know everybody does that, okay?

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:06.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If you are a leader of a country
in the world, you are a target.

00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:09.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Everybody wants to know,
what you’re thinking.

00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:11.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So you are a target.
Friends and foes, right,

00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:13.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
everybody's looking to see

00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:15.663 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
or trying to find out
what you’re thinking.

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:17.123 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Universally true. I mean,

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:19.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that's why diplomacy
was started, right?

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:24.380 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Back in thousands of years ago.
So I mean it’s nothing new.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.508 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Chancellor Merkel, when she
found out her private phone

00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:30.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
was being tapped, I mean
she should have understood

00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:32.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that from the beginning I mean

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and her security should have
told that from the beginning

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and given her some protection.

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:40.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Since all the leaders understood
it, the fact that it’s exposed,

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.607 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you have to object
maybe publicly,

00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but in reality afterward the
relationship is too important

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.279 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to jeopardize just
for a simple thing,

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.239 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that you already
knew was happening.

The problem in relation
to bulk surveillance

00:41:56.723 --> 00:42:03.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is exactly the same as the
problem with global warming.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.606 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
Exactly the same.

00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:10.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's not that it will affect
you right now, individually.

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:12.488 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Why is global warming
interested in you?

00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:14.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Why is the NSA
interested in you?

00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:16.576 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Global warming effects
everyone

00:42:16.576 --> 00:42:18.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because it’s a general
change in things.

00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:21.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Bulk surveillance affects
everyone because it leads to

00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:25.543 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a general change in the
nature of civilization.

00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:29.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Global warming is invisible.
It’s intangible.

00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:32.967 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You only kind of glimpse:
Maybe today was a bit hotter.

00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:35.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I don’t know, is this
coincidence or not?

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:39.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Similarly massive
surveillance is invisible.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:43.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It’s conducted at these points
that connect continents together

00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:47.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
or by the NSA sticking
its fangs into Google.

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:49.734 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And these are extremely
sophisticated

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:51.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and complex technologies

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that everyone except specialists
does not understand.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:58.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Specialists understand it
and say to everyone else:

00:42:58.284 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
"My god can't you see
what's happening?"

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.748 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Similarly in relation
to greenhouse gases,

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:05.917 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
climate scientists
understand it, say:

00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:08.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
"My god, can't you see
what's happening?"

00:43:08.336 --> 00:43:11.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In the case of climate
science, well,

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:14.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
there is a counter lobby which
is the fossil fuel companies

00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:16.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and all those
profiting from that.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.221 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
In the case of
bulk surveillance

00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.181 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
there is the
surveillance industry

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and intelligence
agencies and so on

00:43:22.225 --> 00:43:24.227 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And all those who
are sucking down

00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:26.187 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
this information and
profit from it

00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:29.357 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and form a lobby in the other
direction. So very similar.

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.778 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The fear of terrorist attacks
makes the mass surveillance

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a necessary evil for many.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.074 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The much quoted “If you
have nothing to hide

00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.575 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
you have nothing to fear”

00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.995 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
often legitimizes the
snooping of covert agencies.

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:45.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Yet many are unaware
of the actual extent

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of the surveillance.

00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:13.878 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Our data is transferred
invisibly to huge data centers,

00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:18.174 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
sublimating into
complex new identity,

00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:21.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
creating our digital self.

Everyone gets smarter
because of this technology.

00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.717 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Because its free or
very inexpensive.

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:03.511 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And the empowerment of people

00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.846 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is the secret to
technological progress.

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:12.395 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We are all participating in
this enormous transition,

00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:15.690 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
where billions of people
are joining our party,

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.859 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
joining our fun and
joining our anxiety.

00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
New developments in the
machine intelligence

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.418 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
will make us far far
smarter as a result.

00:46:35.418 --> 00:46:37.837 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And this means everyone
on the planet.

00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The genetics
revolution has a huge

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:43.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and positive impact on the
way we will treat disease

00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:45.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
progression of disease
and forth and so on.

00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Its all basically because
these smart phones

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
are really supercomputers.

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
With the advent of
the smart phone,

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
we have become
even more visible.

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So I would always
call this a spy phone.

00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:44.070 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And it’s not just iPhones
that are spy phones,

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.363 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I mean most smart phones
are these days.

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:49.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Smart phones capture our
communication behaviour,

00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:53.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
how long, when, where
and with whom we talk,

00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:58.250 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
apps collect data about our user
behaviour, even our health data.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
In addition, many people use
digital data storage like clouds

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.633 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
carelessly handing over
their information.

00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:10.387 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
All of our communications are
being intercepted, collected,

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:13.390 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
analyzed and stored
automatically,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and that means that all of our
ideas, all of our thoughts,

00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:20.773 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
all of our expressions, our
associations, who we talk to

00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:23.025 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
who we meet, who
we love, who we hate.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:28.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
As the old internet saying
goes: “if it is for free –

00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:32.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
then you are the product”.
Because the use of all those

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
convenient digital
online services are only

00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:39.834 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
seemingly for free, because
we pay with our data.

The data we create,
assembling our digital self

00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:25.856 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
is also of interest as a
juicy source of information

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.608 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
for the intelligence community.

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:39.119 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So equipment is now being,
put... placed on US networks,

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:41.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
 infrastructure,
electronic infrastructure,

00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:49.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
tapping straight in. Enabled
by critical partnerships,

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the full extent of which have
still not being revealed

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.178 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to this day, not even from
the Snowden disclosures,

00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:59.598 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
AT&amp;T, Verizon and a
number of others.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But that's where it started.

00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:03.811 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It was with the "phone
companies", ok.

00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:07.898 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It was rapidly expanded
to include emails

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.276 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and all related
information, internet usage

00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:13.279 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and all related information
and financial transactions.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.657 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
The revelations
by Edward Snowden

00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:19.576 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
provide detailed insights
into the relationships

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:23.038 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
between intelligence services
and private companies.

00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:28.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Telephone metadata and
web browsing histories

00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:31.588 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are of great interests to
the intelligence community.

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:39.221 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
See, that’s really
industrial relations.

00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:41.890 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They were tapping
the fiber lines

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
between the Google
servers, yeah.

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:48.105 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
They didn’t even know this was
going on. Google did not, okay.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:50.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So I mean, that’s the point.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:52.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They can tap lines
anywhere in the world.

00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:54.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And when they do that,
they can get it

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.530 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
between the servers
of any company.

00:51:56.905 --> 00:52:00.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
From my perspective, I think
there has been massive collusion

00:52:00.326 --> 00:52:03.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
between the big internet
corporations and big government,

00:52:03.537 --> 00:52:06.957 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you know, the big spy agencies,
the military security complex.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:10.336 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
They have agreements between
them where they will pay money

00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:12.421 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
for data if they
produce data for NSA,

00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:17.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
or they will also pay for access
and like for example the room

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:22.723 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the AT&amp;T facility in San
Francisco that has the NSA

00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:25.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
its the NSA room
that has the tap

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:26.935 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
and all now they feed data in

00:52:26.935 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and it’s really AT&amp;T that
has to maintain that room.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.650 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Facebook is evil, in my view,
I’ve been saying this for years.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It is the spy's wet dream.

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:38.447 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We offer up our information and
it’s just there on a plate

00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:39.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for the spies to access.

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we know they do
through back doors and things.

00:52:42.701 --> 00:52:45.537 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And yet, that sort of
information used to take them

00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:47.915 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
weeks or months to
gather on an individual.

00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:50.793 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The extent of information
that Google has is nothing

00:52:50.793 --> 00:52:52.711 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
near what the NSA does.

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:55.130 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
For example they do not have...

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they have the access to the
emails if they are using gmail

00:52:58.342 --> 00:53:01.303 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for example, but not all the
other service providers.

00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So they don’t have that
data to do a composite view

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.976 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of what people are doing,
nor do they have access

00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:10.562 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to all the fiber optic
lines around the world,

00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:13.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
nor do they see the
banking transactions

00:53:13.482 --> 00:53:16.527 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or the financial transactions
or the phone calls,

00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:19.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
they don’t see that so there's
a vast amount of information

00:53:19.947 --> 00:53:21.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that Google does not have.

<i>MUSIC</i>

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So that's something that
is leading to increasing

00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:44.471 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
concentrations of power and
you get some smart people

00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:47.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with these companies
and then these connect

00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:50.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to the National Security
sector as contractors.

00:53:55.399 --> 00:54:00.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So the creative vibrancy
in market capitalism,

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:03.073 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
is what I am concerned about.

00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:06.743 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Many of the companies
concerned reacted immediately

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.537 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to the Snowden revelations.

00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:12.291 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%

mobile phones, and
texting services.

Followed by public
denouncements, pleading,

that they will no longer
put up with the pressure

in the wake of the Snowden

00:54:39.902 --> 00:54:42.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of cooperation between
technology companies

00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:44.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and intelligence
agencies has gone down

all the advances in technology

00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:05.302 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the use of bulk data
analysis, which are improving

the performance of business,
improving the health care

delivery and so on, somehow

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:13.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%

It’s not as if the
more security you get,

00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:24.821 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the less privacy you have, or
the more privacy you have,

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.406 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the less security you have.

In a free society like

your freedoms are
guaranteed by security.

00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:38.460 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so the job of western

00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:50.305 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the technical capabilities
of the intelligence services

00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:52.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
were massively expanded.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.727 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
International collaboration
of national spy organizations

00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:57.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
was also intensified -

00:55:57.646 --> 00:56:00.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
not always without
friction and problems.

like combating
international terrorism,

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:07.322 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but yet they listen
in on one another.

00:56:07.906 --> 00:56:12.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
After when 9/11 hit, there
was this perspective

00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:15.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that Germany had screwed up.

00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:18.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
That the security
services had screwed up.

00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
That they had harbored
terrorists. Right.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:32.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%

transited through, live there,

00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:36.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

cell, there’s no question

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:39.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
about that and there is a
whole history behind it.

00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:43.483 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I think, as I said
this even publicly,

00:56:43.483 --> 00:56:46.194 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I've said this in terms
of the testimony

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:49.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
before the Bundestag, that
Germany within Europe

00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:52.909 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
was declared target number one.

00:56:53.535 --> 00:57:00.709 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I believe, I believe,
significant pressure,

00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:04.338 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but clearly out of the secret
partnership in cooperation

00:57:04.338 --> 00:57:06.757 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
with the BND and
others, was expanded

00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:09.801 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and we know that now, again
more evidence has come out,

00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:11.511 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
there is a special agreement,

00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:15.265 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the secret in expendance of
Shahriar Arraignment.

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:18.685 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It basically gave the
United States carte Blanche

00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:23.440 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but also it was "Hey BND, now
you're not only going

to cooperate, you’re going

00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.480 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it peaked with the German

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the Snowden material

that they've been lying
to the government.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
That's what Intelligence

Or politically embarrassing.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
unless they’re really
heavily monitored

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and there is a verification,

an unquestionable
verification process.

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:34.649 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%

the problem in our country, too.

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:38.612 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We do not have an unequivocal

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
by the vice-president of
Stratfor to the US government.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:18.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
They contained a multi-stage
strategy proposal

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of how to deal with Assange.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.557 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Two weeks after the
hacker attack,

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the accusations of rape
surfaced in Sweden.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:07.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Assange travelled to Sweden in
2010 for a series of lectures.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:11.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
There, investigation proceedings
into sexual misdemeanors

01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:13.775 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
against two Swedish
women were opened.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:18.780 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Assange said he was being
subjected to a smear campaign

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and refuted the allegations.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.534 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
When Interpol issued an
arrest warrant for him,

01:09:23.534 --> 01:09:24.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
he went underground.

01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:27.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Within twenty four hours
it had been dropped,

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.666 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it had been accessed by the
most senior prosecutor

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.752 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
in Stockholm, Eva
Finné, and dropped.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.421 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And she said that there
was no crime. At all.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:37.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
That had been committed.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:42.887 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So later on it came out
in the Supreme Court here

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:48.684 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that both women concerned
had not further complained.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And that one of them had said,

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.438 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that the police
had made this up.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
After a brief game
of hide-and-seek,

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.693 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Assange handed himself
in to the London police

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in December 2010 and was
remanded in custody.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Released on bail, but with
an electronic ankle monitor,

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:08.037 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Assange fought in court against
his extradition to Sweden

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.497 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
on a number of occasions.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:15.837 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The walls were closing in
both from the US side,

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:17.922 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the US was clearly ready,

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:23.302 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and from the Swedish
side and from the UK.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:31.894 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
At the time in June 2012, I
had a lot of surveillance,

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:38.359 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and also GCHQ, as later
came out, was spying on us

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.446 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and the National Security
Agency on me personally.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:46.325 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So there was a risk when
coming to the embassy

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.619 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to apply for asylum

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:53.291 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that action would be seen and
that I would be interdicted.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.670 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But I was extremely
well disguised.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:02.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I didn't look anything
like I normally look.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.804 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But is it true that... I mean
I heard something of a wig

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:10.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and a stone in the shoe.
Is that true?

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.560 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The stone in the shoe
is correct, yes.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:15.104 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And the wig and the clothing?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.606 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Everything was different.

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The reason you put a
stone in your shoe

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.111 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is to change your gait,
because the gait

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.656 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
can be quite recognizable
and that's not an issue

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
if someone is just seeing
you in the newspaper,

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but it is an issue for
a surveillance team.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:38.252 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Since June 2012 Assange
has been stranded

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.630 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
at the Ecuadorian
embassy in London.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:50.681 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
At that time I said: "Well,
I'd be happy to go to Sweden,

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:54.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
provided there's a guarantee
of no extradition

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.728 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
to the United States.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:12:00.191 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Because the London Independent
had already revealed

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:03.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that the US and Sweden
were in informal talks

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.863 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
about extraditing
me from Sweden.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:12.119 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He’d be rendered, yeah. We call
that rendering. You know,

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that's one of the
dark side activities

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that we've been doing.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.502 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Taking people out the street
anywhere in the world

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.462 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and sending them to
different places

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for torture or
imprisonment or whatever.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:38.145 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Once the story is over,
the journalists skip off

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.900 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and break new stories,
they’ve made their careers

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.862 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the whistleblowers left
high and dry, having broken

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:30.865 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
their careers with no hope
of proper employment again.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:34.327 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Having left behind your whole
way of life, your social circle,

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:37.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
everything. And in the case of
Intelligence whistleblowers

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
you face automatic prosecution
and conviction, too.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So it's a very
high price to pay.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Well I mean the real
threat came when the FBI

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:48.507 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
came into my house and when I
was getting out of the shower

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.468 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and pointed a pistol at me.

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:55.097 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So I was getting out of the
shower, getting dried off

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and they came in,
pointing a pistol at me.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.601 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
And also my family.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.979 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So it was threatening, it was
how they're threatening people.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:04.523 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And then after that the
Department of Justice

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:08.569 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
attempted to fabricate
evidence and indict us.

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:13.908 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I was very publicly indicted
with a ten felony count

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:18.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
indictment under the espionage
act facing 35 years in prison.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.544 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
That was the final price.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You've got to
remember that inside

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:30.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the intelligence community
they’re trumpeting these things,

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:33.969 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they are holding these guys
up as examples to say look,

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:36.806 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
if you say what's going on,
if you step out of line,

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:39.350 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
even if you’re doing it
for the right reasons,

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
even if you’re doing
it the right way,

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
there will be repercussions.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:46.148 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They talk about internal
channels and what not,

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.401 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
but these guys used
internal channels,

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.946 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and people like Thomas Drake,
they ended up getting indicted.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:55.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this is something that I
paid very close attention to

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.368 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and I learned a
great deal from.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.620 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It was very rare in
American history

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:04.417 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to get charged with espionage
for non spy activities.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.378 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In fact I was actually only
the second whistleblower

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:10.381 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
charged in like manner. The
first was Daniel Ellsberg.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:12.925 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
When he went to
the Baltimore Sun

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.886 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
he did not reveal
classified information.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, they charged him with
classified, but that was a hoax,

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:22.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
see that was a fraud. They
reclassified material

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:25.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that they found in his computer,
which was not classified.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.648 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and he had every
reason to believe

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:29.400 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
that he would not be prosecuted

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.694 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
for what he gave
to Baltimore Sun.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:35.197 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
He would lose his job, he would
lose  his clearance right,

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:38.200 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
this is very serious, his
jobs depended on clearance.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.536 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In fact most of the
jobs he should have

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.581 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
now would require clearance.
So he was taking

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
a very serious risk.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:49.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I doubt if he thought he
would be prosecuted. I doubt it.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I was black listed. I
was persona non grata.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:56.510 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I was radioactive. No
government agency would take me

01:15:56.510 --> 01:16:01.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
nor any contractor with the
government. It was off limits.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.478 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And NSA made it crystal clear
even though there were attempts

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:08.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
even prior to my
indictment to find work.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
It had all come to naught.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:14.612 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I ended up as a wage
rate employee at Apple,

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:17.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
one of their retail stores
in the greater D.C. area,

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.616 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
where I still work.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:24.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Unable to find any other
work at all of any kind.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.502 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That was the price.
You have no job.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:33.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You have no career.
You have no pension.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:36.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
All those years I served
in the government,

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:39.929 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I am now a traitor and
an enemy of the state.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.644 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The price Thomas
Drake and other whistleblowers

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:49.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
pay for warning against the
danger of a surveillance state

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.566 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
is high. Loss of
friends and family.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:56.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Flight into exile or
long prison sentences,

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
under more stringent
conditions.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:03.035 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Professional isolation and
personal financial collapse.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:52.042 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:02.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It’s so similar! It’s so
weird, it so mirrors the…

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:06.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you become very efficient,
everything is organized,

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
everything is...

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.312 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
It's just like...wow.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.570 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
How far we go in our
efficiency,

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.782 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
erase the sovereignty
of individuals?

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:30.497 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I see how far an
institution will go

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:35.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to erase freedom for
a person's life.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.923 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the only way they can
do that is to control them.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:44.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Every single second of the day
and measure it at the same time.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:45.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:11%
Wow.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.975 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I chose to put myself
inside that system.

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:54.188 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Never imagining what I did.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:57.066 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That I’d be charged
with espionage,

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.486 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
for having defended
the constitution,

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.322 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
protecting the constitution
became a state crime.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.408 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
Ok?

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:09.244 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
 A state crime.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:17.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And we have the power.
You don't.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:24.551 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the end, all they had left
to do was assassinate me.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.889 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
At the character level
that's all they had left.

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.183 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Assassinate me.

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:36.397 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Which is the ultimate
form of control.

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
Right.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:41.735 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It doesn’t matter what even the
crimes against the state were.

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:47.992 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You’re unacceptable.
You’re not fit

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.745 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to work in the government
or be a citizen.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Yeah, you do deserve prison.

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Because you’re the wrong kind.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.966 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Where have we had
that in history?

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:26.739 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:28.949 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Well then, let's go upside.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:33.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You just described how the
FBI team interrogated me.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
In a similar room.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.791 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And they played the good
cop, bad cop with themselves

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.085 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and they brought the
chief prosecutor in.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He threatened me with
spending the rest of my life

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.883 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in prison unless I cooperated
with their investigation.

01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:48.093 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And he said: "You
better start talking."

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I simply said:
"I’m not gonna

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.638 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
plea bargain with the truth."

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
He says: We have more than
enough evidence to put

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.560 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
you away for a long, long time.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.604 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I was declared an
enemy of the state.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I committed crimes
against the state.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But I’m standing here free and
I can't begin to tell you

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:06.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you what it means,
because I’m okay, right.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.697 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So I’m thanking you for
holding up the mirror

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:12.201 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to my own government, okay?
Right, because I’m free.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:16.872 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I did not end up in the
dark hole, okay, alright.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:32.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I’m glad the West
won in that regard

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:38.519 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and yet how paradoxical it is,
that the technology of the west

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:41.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is now being used to mass
surveillance on a scale

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.857 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the Stasi never could
have imagined.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:48.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I don’t need one agent to 180,

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.323 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
quote on quote,
East German citizens.

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.118 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The computer takes
care of it for me.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.828 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
 That’s the real machine.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.248 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
That makes it a lot easier too.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I publicly call for the
dissolution of NSA.

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:07.464 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You can't reform it, there
is no reform possible.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:11.593 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The last thing left, which
is true, is to cut funding.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:23.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The problem is they
weren’t smart enough

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.691 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to understand what
they were creating.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:30.821 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What they in fact were creating
was a master stasi network,

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean this is like
the Stasi on super steroids.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.786 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The Stasi had all this
data on a lot of people

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.581 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but it was all hand written
on paper in files,

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:43.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
so very difficult to
manipulate also hard

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to keep up to date,
hard to keep complete.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.755 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
None of that is a
problem anymore,

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:52.092 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
especially with this electronic
acquisition and information

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.845 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that makes it really simple
so I referred to this

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:57.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as the Stasi on super steroids

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:02.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and NSA I now refer to
as the new Stasi agency.

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:08.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Time after time after time mass
surveillance has come up wanting

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:10.444 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It has been unable to prevent

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.863 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
some of the most
significant terrorists,

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:16.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
well these terrorist
incidents of our day.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It never prevented the
Boston Marathon bombing.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:22.873 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It certainly didn't prevent
the latest Charlie Hebdo

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
massacre in Paris.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Why is that?

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:31.798 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I call these things
data bulk failures.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Simply because, when
you have X-keyscore

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.555 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and you send your people in
to look at all this bulk data,

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:40.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
they're just inundated
with information,

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
they can’t get through it.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:30.148 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
<i>MUSIC</i>

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:32.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
With the next big
evolutionary step,

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:35.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we will face the expansion
of the so-called Internet

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:39.950 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of things: watches, fridges
but also our clothing

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:42.327 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
will be equipped with
Internet connections

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:46.415 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to produce ever-increasing and
evermore precise data about us.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:49.835 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Through automation,
artificial intelligence

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:52.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and ever perfected algorithms,

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:55.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
machines will soon be
able to predict our behaviour.

01:24:56.758 --> 01:25:00.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But what happens to a society,
that is consciously aware

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:03.473 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of being permanently
observed, where every step,

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
every action leaves a trail?

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:09.479 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Our lives in a surveillance
society will be reduced

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.523 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to simmering in a
convenience hell:

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:15.610 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
conformist behaviour,
self-censorship

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:20.407 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and mere consumerism, labelled
as freedom of choice.

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The only guarantee
we can have our own privacy,

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:56.193 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
our own security,

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:59.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
is to take it in our own hands.
We can’t trust the corporations,

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.158 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we cannot trust our governments
and we certainly cannot trust

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:06.745 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the spy agencies to respect our
privacy, and respect the law.

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:08.789 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So that’s the reason
to be hopeful.

01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:11.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Small organization,
very committed people,

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:16.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when even faced by a giant
intelligence bureaucracy

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:18.006 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
like the National
Security Agency,

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like the CIA in an
earlier case,

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:24.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the Pentagon, the DoJ
state department etc.,

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:28.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
can survive and even thrive.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:30.018 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
Ok.

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:33.438 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Get a bloody nose doing
it, but still stand up.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.273 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
I’m not telling you what to do.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:37.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I’m not telling you what
to believe in. You know.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.694 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And it’s okay if you hate me.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.613 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It’s okay if you
disagree with me.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:44.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It’s okay for
everybody, you know,

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:46.785 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to look at this because
we have to decide

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:47.911 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
how we feel, right?

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:50.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We’ve got to stop
thinking that what’s

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
on the news is the
gospel truth.

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:54.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
That what an official
says behind the podium

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:57.754 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
is exactly the right answer.
Or, what I say is something

01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:01.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that should be relied on. I
could be totally full of shit.

01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:03.468 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You’ve got to figure
out what you believe in

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.972 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and stand for it. You
have to stand for it.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:10.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you know, and whether I’m a good
guy, whether I’m a bad guy,

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:12.894 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
whether I’m a hero,
whether I’m a traitor,

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:16.440 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
none of that matters.
Criticize me. Hate me.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But think about what matters
in the issues. Right?

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:22.612 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
