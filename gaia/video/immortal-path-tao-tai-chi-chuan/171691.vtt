to learn to relax, but do
it fast and with power,

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.100 align:middle line:90%

we are very tired,

And Wudang Mountain
is no exception.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:84%
In 2005, amid a
surge in tourism,

the newly-formed
Wudang Tourist Board

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:84%
launched a campaign to
attract more visitors.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
New roads were built, and
luxury hotels soon followed.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:84%
To pay for the improvements,
an entrance fee to the mountain

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:90%
was established.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:84%
This had dramatic
consequences for martial arts,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and echoed the commercialism
which had recently

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:90%
taken place at Shaolin temple.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:84%
At Wudang, many Kungfu
schools were forced

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:90%
to move from the mountain.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:84%
As tourism to Wudang
Mountain gathered momentum,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
it saw its most ambitious
project realized,

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:90%
a University of Kungfu.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
This must surely be Kungfu

With a capacity for
10,000 students,

the recently-opened campus
is far from occupied,

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
